Is stretching a non-functioning limb important?,"Yes! His OT/PT should’ve recommended this after the injury! I’d definitely recommend he see one ASAP, as the years of not stretching can lead to things like clots or tendon tightness that requires surgery. When I stretch my legs even though I’m no longer truly paralyzed anymore, they shake violently because they’re so used to not being used much. It’s a sign that my husband and I aren’t doing enough to stretch them/move around.","Thank you! He is a veteran and from what I've seen of his care it hasn't been the best, but also he doesn't always advocate for himself. I had a hard time understanding google whether it meant SCI who were working towards mobility vs don't have mobility. Getting other's input will probably do a lot towards getting him to stretch."
