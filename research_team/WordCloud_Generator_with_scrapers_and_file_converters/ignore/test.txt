URGENT!!! I need someone to answer this question	Honestly, smoking will shorten your life more than your spinal cord will. I know people who’ve had their spinal cord injuries for 40+ years, and one woman who has had hers for 63 years.	I’m just really anxious could I message you	jrj4rb	gbtg1nf	gbtg3eq*no reply*	jrj4rb	gbtg1nf*no repy id*URGENT!!! I need someone to answer this question	Hey Asher, it depends on the severity of your SCI. There are some that say the injuries at the C vertebrae can be risky for someones life if you dont have the right treatment. Im a T7 complete so it doesnt really affect my breathing muscles too much. But smoking (cigarettes??) will shorten your life more than any SCI. Smoke weed instead 😏

Medical technology is accelerating fast - no spinal cures -  but every other complication will  have therapies/solutions

Upgrade! Got a new TiLite titanium chair with ergo seating. For anyone getting a new manual chair anytime soon check it out. Splurged on the color package and the tattoo engraving.	Going from my quickie to this is literally life changing. The ergo seating helps with balance in the chair so much. It’s literally like I went from a mini van to a sports car.  With ergo seating the seat bar is bent.	Which model did you have previously?	jr8moy	gbrozt2	gbubx00*no reply*	jr8moy	gbrozt2*no repy id*Upgrade! Got a new TiLite titanium chair with ergo seating.
