jr8moyUpgrade! Got a new TiLite titanium chair with ergo seating. For anyone getting a new manual chair anytime soon check it out. Splurged on the color package and the tattoo engraving.gbrozt2Going from my quickie to this is literally life changing. The ergo seating helps with balance in the chair so much. It’s literally like I went from a mini van to a sports car.  With ergo seating the seat bar is bent.

I'm Jelly! That looks so amazing! Enjoy your  new ride!
