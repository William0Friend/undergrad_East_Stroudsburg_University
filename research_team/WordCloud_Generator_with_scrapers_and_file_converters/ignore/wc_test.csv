0,"Hey Asher, it depends on the severity of your SCI. There are some that say the injuries at the C vertebrae can be risky for someones life if you dont have the right treatment. Im a T7 complete so it doesnt really affect my breathing muscles too much. But smoking (cigarettes??) will shorten your life more than any SCI. Smoke weed instead ðŸ˜�",,,,,,,,,,,

9,"Asher you should live until at least 60 unless you get an infection. Eat lots of protein, stay away from sugar and carbs and keep yourself active. You donâ€™t just want long life but you want good quality of life!!",,,,,,,,,,,
10,"Well Iâ€™m 50 and have been in a wheelchair From a car accident (c6 incomplete quad) since I was 16 and still going strong. Smoking isnâ€™t the best thing for you especially with a spinal cord injury as it reduces blood flow to major organs and you want to keep your kidneys healthy. Renal failure along with heart disease  and Respiratory illness are our major downfalls. Stay active, positive and live as healthy as you can and you will live a long as most ABs do.",,,,,,,,,,,

Got a new TiLite titanium chair with ergo seating. For anyone getting a new manual chair anytime soon check it out. Splurged on the color package and the tattoo engraving.Going from my quickie to this is literally life changing. The ergo seating helps with balance in the chair so much. Itâ€™s literally like I went from a mini van to a sports car.  With ergo seating the seat bar is bent.,,,,,,,,,,,

I wasn't even told I was up at C1 until I ""made sufficent progress towards stability"" and was told ""high spinal cord injury"" for a long time. Getting told that was kinda nuts, as I'd previously thought C2 from people not telling me",exactly,where,and my,own research.,,,,,,,

47,"C5/6 incomplete with a skull fracture. I had similar situation to the earlier comment. 16yrs old at the of injury. Taken to kids hospital but too old to be treated. Taken to another to have scans. Taken to another to spend time on a ward before I was transported to a spinal care ward 70 miles away where I was given ALOT better treatment. I canâ€™t remember which of the first 2 hospitals it was but I spent the night in agony as my feet had severe pins and needle and I just needed them rubbed so the pain went away. Was ignored till my parents arrived in the morning, think the nurse mustâ€™ve quit after the telling off my mum gave her",,,,,,,,,,,
48,"I wish I would have waited. I had an accident in a country with mediocre health care. I was operated on by 'best spinal surgeon' in the country. She told my family that I would have no nerve damage whatsoever. On the plane back home I started losing consciousness and had to make an emergency landing. The did a CT scan and there were pieces of bone in my spinal cord that were missed by the surgeon. Had to stay at the hospital over the weekend because there was no weekend transport possible... Then when I got to the hospital in my home country, I was rushed into surgery to remove the rest. Pieces of bone stuck in my spinal cord for 5 days longer than needed.",,,,,,,,,,,

54,So tell me why I was denied disability twice. I'm getting ready for my 3rd round with them. My first surgery to correct issues with arthritis left me unable to walk for about 5 months in 2013. I regained my ability to walk but I still have issues from the waist down. Everything from numbness to severe pain. They just went back in 3 months ago because my new doctor diagnosed me with kyphosis. He cleaned out scar tissue and fixed a bulging disc where I had my first surgery and installed 2 rods to support a spinal fusion. I had a CT scan today because I was still in a lot of pain and they found 2 loose screws in my L2 vertebra.,,,,,,,,,,,
55,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,I've been saved from completely losing my ability to walk twice and I'm grateful that the doctors were able to do that for me. But screw the government for telling me that someone would hire me in my condition. I have to much work experience which means there are a lot of jobs they seem to think I can do. I've stopped typing this out 3 times so far to adjust myself because I'm in pain. I can't even fall asleep without taking a bunch of pills. Spinal injuries are being treated just like mental health in a lot of cases. I have issues with both and neither of them get the attention they need.,,,,,,,,,,,
57,"I didnâ€™t even have a traumatic injury, and spent a total of exactly 11 days in the hospital spinal unit after surgery due to complications. That number just hit me personally.",,,,,,,,,,,
58,These rehab numbers are hilarious compared to Europe. Rehabilitation is often for over 12 months. Granted this is a very slow and ineffective and honestly passive treatment compare to what I've heard of in the US. 23 hours a day in bedâ€¦ one hour of physiotherapy. Poor nutrition.,,,,,,,,,,,
59,"You say ""only an incomplete"", yet you can have an incomplete damage by definition and be just as bad off as someone with a complete injury. Just saying :)Same-ish here, at least in the same order of magnitude. Should we be speaking with personal injury attorneys?You got this my friend. It's only a number now. A distant memory. I spent 4 days in ICU after my reconstructive surgery and another 7 in step down before a month in the ward and then 5 months at in patient rehab. Those first 11 days were definitely wild but looking at how far I've come.. Cant discount anything that's happened.Long shot torso stability questionSounds like it could be scoliosis.

My friends with complete injuries have spasms but donâ€™t feel it. I guess what Iâ€™m getting at is anyway you slice it there are a whole lot of negative issues to deal with. But I try to stay positive or rather more positive by understanding that no matter how bad you got it, someone has it way worse. So do what you can to deal with it then put a little more mental work in and finish it through. Itâ€™s NOT easy but the first hurdle of being alive is behind you.

63,Thank you! She has had no output since yesterday morning. She is post surgery two weeks. I really appreciate your response.Exercise in water?It helped me when I was in hospital. The resistance of the water is a good starting point. As itâ€™s buoyant and if you fall you just float,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"I saw significant gains from exercising in water.   There are a wide range of activities, techniques and underwater equipment that can be performed/used that are super helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,
65,Even when I was in rehab 15 years ago we did PT in the pool.  They had water dumbbells that were basically just floaty dumbbells.

Iâ€™m a t5 Para and For me stretching helps both spasms and nerve pain a ton. Another good way that stretches your heel cord/Achilles etc is the standing frame. Which is also good for circulation and clot prevention.",,,,,,,,,,,
67,I get on the floor and stretch every other day or so.  Both butterfly stretches and my Achilles/calf. Careful with butterfly stretches I tire my groin once pushing to hard lol. Which would be easy not having stretches them in years.,,,,,,,,,,,
68,"Yes! His OT/PT shouldâ€™ve recommended this after the injury! Iâ€™d definitely recommend he see one ASAP, as the years of not stretching can lead to things like clots or tendon tightness that requires surgery. When I stretch my legs even though Iâ€™m no longer truly paralyzed anymore, they shake violently because theyâ€™re so used to not being used much.

78,I recommend these ... these are called bogs! They are freaking amazing ... no zippers ... no laces ... just two handles and slide! They are tall and neoprene insulated ... neoprene is what scuba divers use to keep their bodies warm in water ... so how it works is it traps your temperature and does not release it!! Freaking brilliant!!! They are tall so stuff your pants inside and youâ€™re good to go! They are rated to -40 Degree weather. I have had the same pair for three years And they still look new .. they are amazing and resilient! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜€,,,,,,,,,,,
79,Have you looked at Chacos?  I just got a fleece-lined pair of boots there that I like.,,,,,,,,,,,
80,I recommend the high top vans mountain sneaker. Theyâ€™re easy to throw on and will keep your feet toasty and stylish. Theyâ€™re called the Vans Ultrarange Hi top.  Get them a size or two bigger.,,,,,,,,,,,
81,Slip-on running shoes would perfect. They are very flexible and it takes seconds to put them on without twisting your toes. I've stopped wearing my other footwear since I got them.,,,,,,,,,,,

I wear converse all the time now because they open wider and just fit my foot better. I wear over the knee or thigh high socks in the winter for warmth. I do live in California and it doesn't get super cold. I've also taken butchers broom in the past, it is an herb that is supposed to encourage blood flow in the lower extremities so that might be a consideration. If your feet haven't changed and you love your Docs maybe get a size too big for the winter and invest in some thick ass socks?",,,,,,,,,,,
85,"I went through SO many shoes until I got my leg braces, just trying to find a pair that I could easily put on and off. Iâ€™m at S1, so I have full use of my arms, but lacing and unlacing shoes/boots gets old. My mother in law gave me a pair of her old winter boots that she purposely bought like 6 sizes too big so she could wear fluffy socks inside. Turns out that leg braces or not, I can get into those things easy, and they have a drawstring at the top that I just pull to keep them on. For less cold days, I actually bought these short suede winter boots from Walmart for like $10, and they work! I just made sure to but a size 11, even though Iâ€™m a size 9.5 to accommodate for when I wear my braces.",,,,,,,,,,,
86,I like the style. You have flaccid legs/feet and are able to get them into these boots easily?I use high top vans all the time - mountain sneaker is probably gonna be my go-to this winter.Baclofen users: Do you get anxious if you miss a dose or two?Yes for sure...If myself or my wife miss our nightly dose (we donâ€™t take high amounts 20mg for me 40 for her) we get what we describe as the gitters. Definitely an anxious internal shaky feeling which doesnâ€™t allow us to sleep. Iâ€™ve been on baclofen for 20+ years started at a higher dose but as the years went on the spasms got less so I weaned myself down. Even on 20mg  I get those anxious times when I miss one dose.,,,,,,,,,,,
87,It took the baclofen a few weeks before it finally started working for me but I definitely feel a noticeable difference in anxiety and am more prone to spasms when the nurses are late with my meds.,,,,,,,,,,,
88,I was taking a near lethal does of baclofen daily. I kicked it though. I don't know how you guys do it.,,,,,,,,,,,
89,"Hmm, haven't really missed any doses yet, maybe once (take every 8 hours) but never noticed anxiety. Did notice a huge difference in my spasms though, so that lead to me never missing doses.",,,,,,,,,,,
90,I stopped taking baclofen since it doesnâ€™t work on me. I was odâ€™ing over the summer with 120mg doses at once because my spasms were so frustrating and throwing me out of my chair. I now take CBD and THC with 2 pills of Zanaflex at night. THC causes me lots of anxiety so I can only have max 5mg â€” but it doesnâ€™t help with my spasms the day over which is nice. I can never keep my right leg straight or itâ€™ll spasms immediately. So Iâ€™m always cross legged. I might get the baclofen pump since my spasms are so bad and interfere with my daily life and work focus.,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"Yes! Iâ€™m on 20mg and feel exactly the same. Itâ€™s like impending sense of doom, but with anxiety emotions instead. Not fun. So glad Iâ€™m not alone though.",,,,,,,,,,,
92,,,,,,,,,,,,
93,"Cannabis fixes my regular anxiety, but it only amplifies baclofen based anxiety. A real kicker to figure that one out the hard way.I feel so relieved that itâ€™s not in my head. Itâ€™s distinctly with baclofen. I donâ€™t remember if I took my baclofen last night, and I forgot this morning. By noon time I was feeling anxiety I couldnâ€™t resolve. I feel better about an hour since taking the baclofen (the anxiety resolved when the spasms did too).",,,,,,,,,,,
94,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,I wish I could control my spasms without withdrawal side effects. :(What do you mean by this? Iâ€™m glad you kicked the habit. Iâ€™m more ashamed that I am on baclofen daily than I am to be on cannabis daily.,,,,,,,,,,,
96,,,,,,,,,,,,
97,Itâ€™s a dirty habit that makes me feel like Iâ€™m craving some hardcore shit of stuff I donâ€™t even like. Valium is more recreational to me if we are being honest.,,,,,,,,,,,
98,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"Sorry, I got sidetracked. Anyways, howâ€™d you get off it? Thankfully Iâ€™m only on 40mg total daily but it still sucks.So incredibly stumped with these two quiz questions. Iâ€™m turning to the internet as my last hope!**IS ANYBODY HERE A PLUMBER?**",,,,,,,,,,,
100,Question 1:,,,,,,,,,,,
101,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,"You obviously know that different parts of the spinal cord carry different 'services' so we are looking for which part of the cord carries motor services to the right side (weakness in R leg) and which part carries pain and temperature from the left side (pain and temp L leg), but accepting that the part that carries vibration / proprioception is apparently unaffected.",,,,,,,,,,,
103,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,This image you may have seen before: https://imgur.com/TTXjihi,,,,,,,,,,,
105,,,,,,,,,,,,
106,"Anterior cord is at the bottom of this image, so we are looking for the part of the cord that carries motor on one side and part of the cord that carries pain and temp on the other.  Anterior right side and lateral for the left seems correct to me.  Proprioception being intact would tend to exclude a posterior lesion.",,,,,,,,,,,
107,Question 2:,,,,,,,,,,,
108,,,,,,,,,,,,
109,Pain and temperature sensation are part of the afferent neurological pathways and are closest to the ventral horn in the spinal cord.  See previous image.,,,,,,,,,,,
110,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,I would select ventral horn bilaterally for this.,,,,,,,,,,,
112,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,*Edit and I would probably be wrong.  See other comments.,,,,,,,,,,,
114,"1.	I feel like thereâ€™s no perfect answer to the first question if I had to pick the best answer itâ€™s 17C. itâ€™s Brown Sequard syndrome with sparing of the dorsal columns. The R leg weakness (R corticospinal tract), the L temperature and pain sensation impairment (L spinothalamic tract which decusates/ crosses to the other side R side of the spinal cord before innervating the peripheral limb). Thus the lesion is in the R hemicord but spares the posterior aspect.",,,,,,,,,,,

116,"2.	21B - this is dermatomal sensation loss, sensory comes from dorsal root ganglion https://i.imgur.com/2rDBpCZ.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,
117,"No but I can use a plunger pretty well from a seated position.An odd question but do you think pain from the left side it's transmitted autonomically to the right?Ventral cord would knock out the specific level thatâ€™s affected and everything inferior to that. This seems to be just localized to the waist. Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s more DRG. Thoughts?Legs aching?Man that sux, I'm not a complete so can really give you a good comparison. But i suspect your right about it being nerve pain related. Hope it gets better soon. Maybe try shifting positions ?",,,,,,,,,,,
118,sounds kinda like nerve pain to me,,,,,,,,,,,
119,"I don't know you or what solution is best, but I have to suggest this first.",,,,,,,,,,,
120,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,Start doing a daily stretching routine. 30 mins. On the floor. Every day.,,,,,,,,,,,
122,Do that for a month and see how you feel.,,,,,,,,,,,
123,"How long have you been injured? Iâ€™m incomplete and experience leg pain from poor circulation, so maybe that could have something to do with it? Not trying to be offensive, because I have no idea how different your sensation is, but just a suggestionâ€¦ Hope you feel better, though.",,,,,,,,,,,
124,"I have similar sensations. Not a lot I can do about it - I felt it was at its worst early on (presumably muscle pain from atrophy?). Perhaps try stretching, massage, cold/hot water, and other experiments to see what works.",,,,,,,,,,,
125,"Sucks dude. I get that when my seat gel needs adjusting, I've been sitting too long, or my sciatic nerve is unhappy. I always check my seat for hard spots first, with some pressure relief dips. If it's still there, I then lay down for 30 minutes or a nap (I just schedule this at 2pm everyday now)",,,,,,,,,,,
126,"Hey! T5/6 complete here, 12 years out. I also have this feeling and it's gotten worse over the past year. Sometimes my thigh feels like it's being twisted underneath my skin.",,,,,,,,,,,
127,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,"Recently, my neurologist started me on pregabalin and it's helped a lot. They've also suggested an Open Rhizotomy.",,,,,,,,,,,
129,,,,,,,,,,,,
130,It's really annoying and I'm sorry you're going through this too,,,,,,,,,,,
131,T5 complete here I get this same exact thing. Feels like a wicked Charlie horse..... Iâ€™m pretty sure its just nerve pain. Happens frequently.,,,,,,,,,,,
132,Oh yeah I have constantly it fucking blows lmao - good luck i haven't found anything to deal with it,,,,,,,,,,,
133,It sounds like nerve pain to me. When I take CBD/THC my legs are on fire for a few hours. I was complete inpatient for a five months before transitioning and what you described sounds like a mix between nerve pain and maybe some areas of partial preservation firing back towards your brain ðŸ§ ,,,,,,,,,,,
134,"I've been shifting and stretching all day, I think it's related to spasticity and I'm just going to have to get a baclofen pump soon.It's been about 2 and a half years, it might be circulation but I'm not sure.Thanks, it seems to be pretty much gone today. I was on pregabalin and gabapentin but they made it incredibly hard to think so I had to stop. I think I've narrowed it down to poor circulation/legs being cold or some kind of irritation along the injury line that mimics the pain.Just had my surgery for cervical myelopathyAh, that reminds me of my operation. I was told I spent most of the 8 hours in a sitting, forward leaning position, and I was unable to leave the hospital bed due to muscle pain.",,,,,,,,,,,

136,"Warm baths helped, but the healing process first needs to allow for that.",,,,,,,,,,,
137,Question about Bladder Medication and/or Condom CathetersHas your so been to a urologist? I mean if it's been three years then things can change and a urinalysis and perhaps a cystoscopy would be beneficial for urinary tract health.,,,,,,,,,,,
138,,,,,,,,,,,,
139,There could be a stone? Leakage means higher pressure and constant high pressure or high pressure in general can cause problems further down the road.,,,,,,,,,,,
140,"I recommend talking to a urologist about the medication oxybutynin. I take 15mg per day (10mg morning, 5mg night) and no longer have problems with bladder spasms.",,,,,,,,,,,
141,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxybutynin):,,,,,,,,,,,
143,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,"Oxybutynin, sold under the brand name Ditropan, is a medication used to treat overactive bladder. In 2017, it was the 100th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than seven million prescriptions.",,,,,,,,,,,
145,Ok I have a lot of experience with this.,,,,,,,,,,,
146,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,"So first of all the primary purpose of a condom catheter is for a individual who would not be intermittently cathing. You are probably right that if your SO was applying and removing one say 5 times a day skin would break down. I used condom caths for the majority of the day for around 4 years, I stopped because in the last year I was experiencing UTIâ€™s 2-3 times a month.",,,,,,,,,,,
148,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,I saw a urologist who recommended medication but it was not effective for me but do know some who have benefited greatly from medication. Iâ€™m not sure I understand what you mean by â€œnatural flushingâ€�.,,,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,,,,,,,,,
151,"My recommendation is Botox injections in the bladder. This has been a miracle cure for me, I used to have â€œleaksâ€� multiple times a day but now I never have any and  I can go long hours without cathing. Again my urologist recommended this to me after medication wasnâ€™t successful.",,,,,,,,,,,
152,"I am a T-6 incomplete Asia A/B and I use condom catheters every night with a bag as I canâ€™t hold my bladder past ~250/300ml. During the day I find myself selfcathing every 3-4 hours as accidents can be common for me. I would say as long as you use the protective skin wipes with the condom catheter (acts as a barrier between the condom and the skin to prevent any damage) and donâ€™t keep the condom catheter on for more than 8-10 hours at a time, letting the skin breathe during the day, you should be completely fine.

476,Since I was injured I have gone from ASIA B ->D->C.  Itâ€™s really easy to focus on the ASIA scale because itâ€™s measurable and standardized and quantifiable at a time when nothing is sure or predictable and no-one is giving answers that feel real or useful (thatâ€™s how I felt anyway) but ultimately I didnâ€™t find it helpful - I got derailed by it entirely - it was more helpful to me to focus on the gains I made over time and how to improve those and my skills and not worry about the scale.,,,,,,,,,,,

At six months post I had a re-eval and became an Asia-C with motor function and sensory. I noticed changes in sensation and motor and was like this isnâ€™t right. To be a defacto incomplete you have to have sensation three levels below your site of injury with strong results â€” and or anal/function/sensory. I canâ€™t feel my legs but I can move them.

577,I had flap surgery done on my left ischium in 2017 due to stage 4 pressure ulcer.  Here are my take aways:,,,,,,,,,,,
578,,,,,,,,,,,,
579,"- As others have said, if it's being suggested, it's necessary.  It's pretty much a last resort.",,,,,,,,,,,
580,,,,,,,,,,,,
581,"- My surgeon flat out said to me that he avoids doing them because of the risk of failure due to patients not listening to instructions. Your dad will have to unquestioningly do as he is told by clinicians in order to successfully, fully recover from flap surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,
582,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,"- The recovery is by far the worst part. Surgery sucks, there's no doubt about it. But my pain was minimal because most of the surgery site was below my level of injury.  But you cannot put pressure on the surgery site whatsoever. So after I recovered for 11 days in the hospital, I was sent to a long-term care hospital to recuperate. I spent 62 days in that long-term care facility. 50 of them (in a row) were spent **flat on my back.** They put me in a Clinitron bed (effectively, a mattress filled with sand-like material that constantly moves underneath you to prevent further pressure sores. A bed that wiggled 24/7.) I could not roll to either side because of my surgery and varying pressures. So it had to be on",my back,It w,s abso,"utely, mind-n",mbi,gl,bru,al.,Upo,that 5,st day
584,,,,,,,,,,,,
585,"- I was told I was a model flap surgery patient. I didn't ever break the rules. I did exactly what my surgeons, wound care professionals, nurses, everybody told me to do. I never wanted to experience this again, and I never wanted this to be a problem again. So I was diligent and **never** deviated from instructions. As a result, I healed as best as expected.  It was a success.",,,,,,,,,,,
586,,,,,,,,,,,,
587,"- Fortunately for me, I had no real complications. Some of my incision site got a little wonky so it's not pretty. But after going through that hellish year, I don't care about my scars. I'm glad to be alive (I got septic from my pressure sore... Almost didn't make it.)",,,,,,,,,,,
588,,,,,,,,,,,,
589,"All in all, would I do it again? Dear God I hope I never have to. It was probably the worst experience of my life, other than breaking my back.  But, with a life-threatening stage 4, you don't have many more options.  Tell your dad to do it, to listen to everything he's told, and he will come out of it okay.  Happy to share any other information if you have questions. I'm not shy.",,,,,,,,,,,
590,I've had rotational flaps on both ischial tuberosities. They work a treat. Good fresh new think skin to pad you over for a few decades. Highly recommend before you get too old and you skin thins.,,,,,,,,,,,
591,"I had a flap surgery to close a sacral pressure wound, I spent 2 weeks flat on my back on a sand bed. Healed nicely, looks gruesome though.",,,,,,,,,,,
592,It just occurred to me - there are these weird glasses with sort of triangle reflective prism things and one of the nurses loaned me a pair after a surgery that kept me flat on my back for a month so that I could still read and stuff bc I wasnâ€™t allowed to lift my arms or anything.  I will ask around and see if any of my family remembers what they were called but maybe someone else here or one of the OTs your dad works with will know?,,,,,,,,,,,
593,,,,,,,,,,,,
594,ETA: theyâ€™re called periscope readers or horizontal lazy readers.  They were a big help.,,,,,,,,,,,
595,"I have. It is absolutely brutal but usually when the wound care docs are recommending it, itâ€™s necessary. The toughest part is sticking to the recovery regime but it was the best choice by far. Find a surgeon who has done this before because itâ€™s a specialist operation and you need somebody who specializes in reconstruction. Ischial or Sacral?",,,,,,,,,,,
596,I had flap surgery on my left and right ischium at the same time. Everything went well. I was in the hospital on bed rest for 6 weeks so that sucked but it healed great and hasnâ€™t happened again. Just gotta find a plastic surgeon thatâ€™s done it before. Flap surgery is a pretty basic procedure for surgeons so as long as you find someone that has experience with it I think youâ€™ll be in good hands. Good luck I know how rough of a road pressure sores are but hopefully itâ€™s almost over.,,,,,,,,,,,

601,,,,,,,,,,,,
602,No. Way.,,,,,,,,,,,
603,,,,,,,,,,,,
604,"I went to an outside doctor who was board certified in wound care. She assured me that we could avoid surgery. I wasted five months trying everything to get the wound to close. At the end she suggested flap surgery. I left her and went straight to the VA. The sympathetic nurse told me that most of the vets try to avoid the surgery as I had, but eventually they have to have it.",,,,,,,,,,,

794,"If you decide to try them, here are some things you may want to keep in mind:",,,,,,,,,,,
795,,,,,,,,,,,,
796,"Increase in blood pressure. Not a huge amount, but just be mindful of it.",,,,,,,,,,,
797,,,,,,,,,,,,
798,"Alternatively, a decrease in blood pressure. Make sure you have a way to get horizontal/head between the knees if you need to at any time during the trip so you won't pass out.",,,,,,,,,,,
799,,,,,,,,,,,,
800,"Increase in muscle spasms, possibly for hours. Sometimes mild, sometimes strong. I've heard it's often worth it, though.  Be careful because sometimes knees will lock together which may cause pressure marks to form.",,,,,,,,,,,
801,,,,,,,,,,,,
802,"Time dilation. This is a normal part of a mushroom trip, and normally would be of no concern, but paralyzed people live by the clock. Don't forget to do pressure shifts for your skin, to take care of any bladder and bowel needs, or to take necessary medications. Set alarms on your phone so you can relax and not worry about the clock. Drink water.",,,,,,,,,,,
803,,,,,,,,,,,,
804,"Also remember that if you have chronic pain, mushrooms will likely reduce or remove that pain, so you'll probably push your body more than you would on a typical day. Have pain meds ready to take before bed.",,,,,,,,,,,
805,,,,,,,,,,,,
806,"Finally, type out a list that has your SCI level and any other medical conditions; all your medications; plus the fact that you've taken mushrooms, the amount, and the time you ingested them. In the VERY slight chance you do have to go to the hospital, instead of having to answer a bunch of questions coming at you when you're high as fuck you just throw this list at them. I'm not saying you'll end up in the ER if you take shrooms -- it's just kind of a security blanket more than anything.",,,,,,,,,,,
807,,,,,,,,,,,,
808,"One good thing about being in a wheelchair/disabled and tripping is that you can go out in public and act like a complete doofus and no one will blink an eye. Just sit and stare at a tree for twenty minutes and laugh, no one will care.",,,,,,,,,,,
809,,,,,,,,,,,,
810,"Edit: Now that I think about it, maybe don't write down on that typed list that you took shrooms, because I wouldn't want you to get into any legal trouble.  Save that info for verbal transmission.  But the rest of it -- SCI level, conditions, medications -- that's a good list to have on you not just for a trip, but all the time, really.",,,,,,,,,,,
811,"I would recommend doing the lemon tek method as they come on fast, hit hard, and don't linger for hours. Might be good to get it over with if your body is not having a good time. I have a lower injury and it all goes through my bladder super fast.",,,,,,,,,,,
812,,,,,,,,,,,,
813,,,,,,,,,,,,
814,"Grind the mush up good, let it sit in lemon for 20 mins, and pour some hot water in it then drink.",,,,,,,,,,,
815,The first time I took shrooms I believe it was only 1.5 grams.,,,,,,,,,,,
816,,,,,,,,,,,,
817,"My spasticity was... unusual. I wasn't violently spastic, but the spasms were not enjoyable. Within 15-20 minutes after taking the shrooms the skin on my legs started moving in a manner not dis-similar to when a horse shakes off a fly. There were a lot of goosebumps going on. The spasticity was bad enough I thought I might have a bowel accident from everything clenching a bit. The nerves kept firing in my twenty-years-atrophied pectoral muscles. They were not bad, just constant.",,,,,,,,,,,
818,,,,,,,,,,,,
819,"I developed a massive amount of phlegm. I'm a C4 quad, so needed assistance leaning forward so I could cough it up. I can tell you from experience that you don't want a high friend helping you out with something that feels like a medical emergency. This occured about an hour into the trip... maybe sooner. It was as if I developed instant pneumonia. I ended up calling a care provider in to monitor me while I rode out the rest of the trip. The phlegm subsided with time.",,,,,,,,,,,
820,,,,,,,,,,,,
821,I had no autonomic dysreflexia issues.,,,,,,,,,,,
822,,,,,,,,,,,,
823,"It was fun for the first 45-60 minutes, and then the phlegm got crazy and things got scary feeling.  I tried micro-dosing a few times afterward and experienced the spasms but not the phlegm. I wanted visuals, though, and micro-dosing just doesn't get you there. I moved on from shrooms to DMT and have been much happier.",,,,,,,,,,,
824,"Done shrooms, lsd and dmt multiple times as a t4-t5 complete, spasms are massively strong while tripping and the shaking of my legs pretty much don't stop and they continue 1-2 days after tripping, whenever I think it's annoying to deal with I just jump over to the couch and sit on my legs(make sure you don't hurt urself tho) and it makes it super easy to deal with.",,,,,,,,,,,
825,T3 complete,,,,,,,,,,,
826,,,,,,,,,,,,
827,"I used to love drugs, but after my accident, not so much. Acid and  shrooms are the worst in my opinion.... the spasms I get are just incredibly painful and violent, and the level of sweat is ungodly. Molly and X is more enjoyable [less side effects]. But mainly I just smoke weed now, maybe some coke here and there.",,,,,,,,,,,
828,,,,,,,,,,,,
829,But over all the spasms I get just make it not worth it in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,
830,"lol DO NOT do shrooms if you fear spasms, nonstop, for 6+ hours",,,,,,,,,,,
831,,,,,,,,,,,,
832,"the only way I survived my shroom trip was by smoking ALOT of  weed that day and consuming edibles and oils. I know this sounds crazy but the spasms were so bad I was getting AD. Furthermore, since I was tripping, my mental state was horrible because I was witnessing my legs move without my control and it was depressing and scaring me. As well as the person I was with.",,,,,,,,,,,
833,,,,,,,,,,,,
834,"personally, I would never do shrooms again. And I don't think anyone with an SCI should either, but that's just my opinion, and you're free to have your own experiences :)",,,,,,,,,,,
835,"Everyone I know that has done them have violent spasms for hours. It makes you sweat an incredible amount also. If youâ€™re going to do them, make sure youâ€™re in an environment where you can control the temperature and have plenty of water available.",,,,,,,,,,,
836,"This is great information, what are the side effects of DMT?im in the same boat as this guy, except im t6 complete, and swap shrooms out for 2cb.. but yeah my legs go wild for days after lsd (and even mdma) - dmt they stop pretty much right after the trip ends though, which is hella nice.  normally they are not too bad.  its manageable if you're on the couch... but in the chair its kinda dumb, wouldnt really want to go anywhere with spasms like that.",,,,,,,,,,,
837,,,,,,,,,,,,
838,"aside story: one time my ex and I did 2cb and we ended up in the hospital cause she had a bad trip and got super scared cause her heart was racing and she thought something bad was happening lol.. i kept trying to eat more baclofen to calm my spasms down in the hospital so they took it away from me cause they told me i was on enough drugs lolFoley care/ painHoly shit. Story of my life! In case no one else brings it up or asks, what size catheter (16 French) and what size balloon (30mL) and how full are you filling it (10 mL)?",,,,,,,,,,,
839,,,,,,,,,,,,
840,"See if it helps by getting away from a sitting position and on to your hip. Iâ€™m curious if the pressure between your urethra and youâ€™re sitting surface could be contributing/compressing/pinching things off. Along the same lines, when was the last time you had a bowel movement. I believe a firm sitting surface combined with, forgive the expression, a â€œfull rectal vault,â€œ could contribute to difficulty draining.",,,,,,,,,,,
841,,,,,,,,,,,,
842,Are you also having bladder spasms/strong urge to urinate? Is there a possibility you have any kind of infection?,,,,,,,,,,,

844,Iâ€™m looking forward to what you find out from the others here.,,,,,,,,,,,

It also feels like a belt tide around my abdomen in two different areas.Recovery is now delayedHow to stay on insuranceMedicaid isn't insurance. It's really designed as free healthcare for poor people.

869,"Hereâ€™s another thing to consider about Utah - the waitlist for adult HCBS is 8 years.  You can qualify and get approved in weeks but funding is prioritized for children so you will not get funded until every single child who needs services and all adults who predate you on the list receive services.   If you need paid care, it will be out of pocket until you come up on the list.  Voc Rehab is the same situation, last I heard the waitlist is longer.",,,,,,,,,,,

883,,,,,,,,,,,,
884,"My recommendation is get one that can tilt, so that he can recline easily. Second, a very high back so that resting becomes easy. Third, the cushion needs to be ROHO (or something similar) to prevent pressure sores. Fourth, consider a headrest.

888,"I personally use a motorized wheelchair, which has leg raising, back tilting, body tilting. It has a headrest and I use the ROHO back and cushion. The model I have is Quickie Q 700. Highly recommended. When he is tired it is very easy to recline and because it is solid it does not fell like it would accidentally tip. It can also be switched to a manual mode (not easy for long distance is but definitely doable for the house).",,,,,,,,,,,

893,Ask about getting a second controller for the back of the power chair. I think there is a way to control it from behind with a second controller. That's a better solution if he already has a well fitting chair. You might also find a way to move the controller from front to back.,,,,,,,,,,,

It takes some getting used to for sure and I would be amazed if anyone came out of a 20 minute training session totally able to do it themselves. Just keep trying. Itâ€™s helpful to have someone on hand while youâ€™re learning cause sometimes the stress of needing to pee can make it even harder. Give it a couple tryâ€™s each time you have to cath and if itâ€™s not working out this round, let your caregiver take over and try it again next time.

902,,,,,,,,,,,,
903,Also let your OT know that youâ€™re practicing self cath and they can give you some additional practice like putting a straw into a small hole. Idk your injury level but if your hands are impacted at all practicing that kind of precision is really helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,
904,"While Iâ€™m not a female, after reading your post I felt like I needed to reply. I started intermittent catheterizing myself around a month ago. When they showed me how to do it in the office, I was so nervous that I was shaking and had a very difficult time getting it in. And for the first week I lived in dread of having to do it because it was so very uncomfortable. I started bleeding the first couple of days, which I was told can be a side effect of starting to catheter. But something happened after like a week or so. It just became very normal and really easy to do. I donâ€™t think twice about it now, and it really is relieving to know there is an easy way to completely empty my bladder.

942,"* If you get to the bladder muscle (sphincter) and can't go in, don't back out and push back in repeatedly. This causes trauma and hurts!",,,,,,,,,,,
943,"* Instead, when you find you are ""knocking on the door"", just hold the catheter in place with a little pressure and wait. Deep breaths in and fully out. Try to relax. I've had this take a solid 3 minutes before, but then suddenly the muscle finally lets go and you're in like Flynn.",,,,,,,,,,,
944,"* The most painless way to intermittent cath is laying down on a bed with pillows propping you up. As I'm still fairly new to this, I'm putting down an absorbent pad and have one of those 1 liter bedside urinals. It takes a little bit of coordination not to spill, thus the pad.",,,,,,,,,,,
945,,,,,,,,,,,,
946,"When I was cathing standing, sometimes it was fine with lots of coughing and throat-clearing to get past the various bends (women's urethra is a lot straighter whereas guys have to make a shallow turn and then a near 90 degree turn).  And sometimes it hurt like hell, I'd traumatize myself and even a blood clot once. Not good!! Laying on a bed and giving yourself plenty of time instead of rushing or getting impatient and pushing harder is what has worked for me.",,,,,,,,,,,
947,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was asked only once if preserving some DNA was interesting to me, at the age of 16, in front of far too many people to feel confident about giving an honest answer. The physicality of that aspect of life was also omitted, but another commenter has spoke to that so I will leave it therefore this topic.",,,,,,,,,,,

1096,"The other thing that bothered me at the time was the endless worst case scenario talk. I recognized the level of my injury. But on the night that I arrived at the hospital that would treat my broken neck, the neurosurgeon resident, one is still working in this city, I have seen not that long ago, and told my parents that what you see is what you get. Well, neurologically I recovered a lot from that. And obviously being in rehabilitation you know that when taught well, a person can do a lot with very little function.

1098,"Obviously depression is a large factor after a traumatic injury, but my follow-through is what it always had been, in my short 16 years. My goals were to work through my emotions with the people that I trusted and get the ball rolling again so I could get back to whatever my life is going to look like. Laying in bed crying was not going to make things better any faster. Accomplishing something, feeling like work is being done towards getting me back to Independence, and going home is what I needed and she absolutely never got that.",,,,,,,,,,,

Spinal Cord Injury Saskatchewan, formerly Canadian Paraplegic Association - Saskatchewan chapter, had peer support programs in place, but were incredibly limited at the time. They are slightly better now, but not much. And, type of mental health care in our Province and country is abysmal, to say the least.

1103,"One more thing, just to echo u/nonnumousetail: I had a similar experience in my rehab regarding women's sex ed.  I was excited when sex ed day came around, only to be told, along with the other women in rehab, that the class was only for the men.  Us women were given a pamphlet on fertility and pregnancy, and something about how cuddling and holding hands were still important.  The word ""orgasm"" wasn't even mentioned anywhere in it.",,,,,,,,,,,

1105,"Nothing else.  I was shocked.  I felt like my sexuality meant nothing; it wasn't even important enough to warrant a few minutes of class time.  But in my traumatized and weakened state, I was in no place to fight back.  I feel myself wanting to cry just remembering it.",,,,,,,,,,,

It was a battle to continue to receive mental health meds while in acute care, the PM&R docs didnâ€™t know/discuss/disclose interactions between the psych meds I was on and the opiates and gabapentin/pregabalin they enthusiastically prescribed.  It was deeply frustrating.  Referrals from inpatient & outpatient case management for mental health care and for TBI followup have been extremely challenging to obtain and inaccurate.",,,,,,,,,,,
1115,"Please, please, please do this! No one talked to us at all about sex and fertility. Everything we found out was from google and the WAGS support group.^  this!! Its literally different for everyone and no patient wants to talk about it.Yes! I totally agree with this. We actually had SCI classes in Rehab when I was in the hospital, and one of the classes was on sex education after injury. The only information they had for women was, â€œyou can still get pregnant, donâ€™t worry!â€œ And then the rest of the hour was about how guys can still get it up and what tools they might be able to use.",,,,,,,,,,,
1116,,,,,,,,,,,,
1117,"Likeâ€¦ I donâ€™t want to get pregnant, I want to know what I might expect out of sex going forward. Like, should I just assume that I need extra lube?

1121,"The first facility had many many many hours of lovely videos to watch while you lay in bed.  Many.  Well produced, nicely written, attractively cast.  And watching those videos counted as â€œeducationâ€�, which freed up nurses, OTs and PTs to provide care and therapies, explained the docs.  But videos donâ€™t give family experience providing care, donâ€™t provide any opportunities for asking questions  and they donâ€™t teach injured folks how to describe and ask for what they need. I left that world famous hospital terrified and desperate and incompetent.",,,,,,,,,,,
1122,,,,,,,,,,,,
1123,"Facility two had small group classes for the injured, their SOs and families on things like how to get up off the floor when you fall; advocating for yourself when hospitalized; cleaning catheters and bop tools: bleach solution vs vinegar solution; how to make your bowel program not take three hours; sexuality and sex workers and devotees.  I left feeling more competent, less frightened and more optimistic than since before the initial injury.We are still in the baby stages so i don't have a link. We are rehab doctors, nurses, psychologists and psychiatrists from centers around the country trying to figure out what we could be doing better.",,,,,,,,,,,

Oh, I recieved nerve damage during surgery nearly 8 years ago. I just had my second surgery 3 months ago and I'm still sore. My legs constantly tingle and my muscles twitch all the time. I had to learn how to walk again after my first surgery. Great that I can walk, but I can't do it for long. I can't sit for too long either",,,,,,,,,,,

Sure enoughâ€¦ Freaked me the fuck out. Their advice was to drink plenty of fluids and limit sitting up if it caused headaches. It did.",,,,,,,,,,,
1248,,,,,,,,,,,,
1249,Try not to freak out.,,,,,,,,,,,
1250,I had a slow CSF leak that left me with a largish pseudomeningocele after a spinal surgery.  Because I was able to tolerate the headaches etc with caffeine and positioning they monitored me pretty closely but didnâ€™t do anything about it and eventually the dura healed up and all the CSF reabsorbed. .,,,,,,,,,,,
1251,I have not but I had a C2-T1 laminectomy with fusion. Best of luck to him. It's not going to be easy going forward.,,,,,,,,,,,
1252,7 weeks seems like a long time. Does he have a *massive* headache which would indicate a CSF leak?,,,,,,,,,,,
1253,"Thanks! He had a drain initially to help the fluids in the hospital, but itâ€™s all healed now and just looks like itâ€™s a puffy bubble!!Thank you! You are always super helpful with my questions, I really do appreciate it. His is almost the size of a tennis ball. Does that seem out of the ordinary?Thanks! Sounds like a similar level of injury to yours.",,,,,,,,,,,

1256,"He got 2 weeks in the hospital and a whopping 3.5 weeks in rehab before coming home. He started to get more and more sensation in his feet, legs and back. We are hoping it might be a sign that things are firing back up, but of course you never know.Reading some of your posts, his issue was also due to stenosis over the years. He had bone spurs growing in his spinal canal and we think one bruised/injured the cord really bad towards the middle of his back. I believe the doctor did the operation in his neck mostly to preserve his upper body function.No, no huge headache. I am wondering if itâ€™s just slowly leaking and has now caused this big bubble.

I'm ambulatory now with the use of crutches, but I'm incomplete, so it's hard to say what would've happened with or without it.",,,,,,,,,,,
1258,"Iâ€™ve tried three types of exoskeleton and only the Rewalk and Indigo were approved for use outside a therapy setting. Regardless, each had positive and negative aspects but getting up and moving helped me a lot in my progress. Iâ€™m lucky I was exposed to them and great PTâ€™s to help me on a path to a better life.",,,,,,,,,,,

1260,Mine just came with my chair but I imagine if you needed a replacement a bike shop could help. I use the solid insert in what I think are shadow rims,,,,,,,,,,,
1261,I get the regular primo everyday tires.  25-540. I get them from Sportaid. They last about 4 months before the tread is gone.,,,,,,,,,,,
1262,"I use Spinergy wheels https://www.spinergy.com and have a set of extra wheels that came with my chair that was scripted for me. I prefer my Spinergy  SLX wheels as I have a special side grip on it for my wrists. But theyâ€™re expensive and cost about 1,200usd.",,,,,,,,,,,
1263,Marathon Plus and Iâ€™m probably on my 8 or 9th set. Buy them online and get the local bike shop to fit them for me as I use Spinergy Lx wheels and itâ€™s a tight fit.,,,,,,,,,,,

1265,https://www.schwalbe.com/en/tour-reader/marathon-plus,,,,,,,,,,,
1266,yup Schwalbe marathon plus for me too,,,,,,,,,,,
1267,I use Schwalbe tires like a lot of others. Thereâ€™s basically 3 ways I can go about getting them:,,,,,,,,,,,
1268,,,,,,,,,,,,
1269,"1: **National Seating & Mobility**. To go this route, you set up an appointment and they will make an assessment for what you need. From there, they contact your insurance to charge them and then order them. It takes about 6-8 weeks for them to arrive and when they do, theyâ€™ll set you up with a second appointment to come in and put them on. When you do it this way, they will also look at your chair and order any other parts that need replacing, i.e; casters, axles, brakes, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,
1270,,,,,,,,,,,,
1271,"2. **Local Bike Shop**. This route is a lot faster but you pay out of pocket. The first time I did it this way I just went in, they figured out what size I needed (It helps if you already know but theyâ€™ll double check either way) and then they ordered it. This only took about a week, tops. If youâ€™re real lucky they will have them in stock. The price out of pocket depends on size and tread etc, but I pay between $60 and $80",,,,,,,,,,,
1272,,,,,,,,,,,,
1273,"3: **Ordering Online**. This is my least favorite way since you have no way to make sure youâ€™re getting the right tire. You need to know exactly what size you need and you have to put them in yourself, which is not easy at all, or you can ask your local bike shop to help you. This takes about 6-8 weeks and the out of pocket cost is usually between $60 to $80 but you also pay shipping, which can be expensive and varies greatly depending on where you are and where youâ€™re ordering from. After all that, you could get them and they may not be the right size, width or tread . Itâ€™s almost impossible to return them for a replacement, let alone trying to get a refund.",,,,,,,,,,,
1274,,,,,,,,,,,,
1275,"My favorite and recommended way for just getting tires alone is your local bike shop. Itâ€™s fast, less expensive, and the people there are always super helpful and friendly and they often have ordered tires for wheelchairs in the past, so they have a bit of experience with it.",,,,,,,,,,,
1276,,,,,,,,,,,,
1277,"Hope this helps, good luck!",,,,,,,,,,,
1278,"I have used Schwalbe, Kenda, Primo",,,,,,,,,,,
1279,,,,,,,,,,,,
1280,"I havenâ€™t done a study to compare cost to durability, but they all seem about the same - you get what you pay for, if durability and service are your interest",,,,,,,,,,,
1281,I live in Minnesota found the best winter tires ever! On amazon for like 20$. Donâ€™t let the wheelchair manufactures fool you. If your looking to save money mountain bike tires are the same damn thing! Lol. Only thing I notice with these tread filled masterpiece of tires is the fo leave more black on your hands and sone kinds of floors.  Def worth the  trade to plow thru snow in the winter.,,,,,,,,,,,

I've never noticed temperature causing them. It will make them more intense. Mine typically start whenever I start getting really tired. They aren't painful, but they are really bothersome. Sometimes my leg will stretch out and others it will tense up like a Charlie horse. When it gets going cool air does intensify things. Then again anything that touches my leg will.

1291,"Yep, T8 complete and cold sends pain and spasms through the roof.",,,,,,,,,,,
1292,Pretty normal your body is reacting in the absence of instruction from your body.  It doesn't have the full connection to the brain to let it know it is over reacting.   Slightly related prior to my injury tickling my feet would give no reaction but now makes my feet jump and twitch like crazy,,,,,,,,,,,
1293,"No spasms, but cold weather just makes my body feel horrible in general.",,,,,,,,,,,

1299,"I started dating right out of rehab and I couldn't orgasm for 29 months post injury. 13 years later, it's still a 1 in 10 chance that I'll have one during sex. I've always expressed to and educated my partners that it is a result of the injury but still incredibly pleasurable. Some partners weren't affected at all and took it as a challenge and others simply felt like they failed.",,,,,,,,,,,

1306,,,,,,,,,,,,
1307,I hope you can both find a way of exploring her fears and giving her the confidence and reassurance that you're enjoying every aspect of your sex life.,,,,,,,,,,,
1308,Sorry youâ€™re struggling. These limitations are a reality we all must face at some point with this injury. The only thing you can do is give it your best and communicate. At the end of the day if you guys arenâ€™t compatible then thereâ€™s not much else you can do but move on to someone one more compatible.,,,,,,,,,,,
1309,Iâ€™m in her shoes. And i sort of know where sheâ€™s coming from. From the sounds of it donâ€™t put and pressure on you. Itâ€™s a her thing. She needs to be ok with her self and confident with her self. Communication is key you guys just need to be a lot more open and have honest frank conversations. And perhaps a little bit more creative getting to know each otherâ€™s bodyâ€™s.,,,,,,,,,,,
1310,It also may just not be right for the both of you and itâ€™ll be a bit pants for a bit but that just means thereâ€™s someone else out there for you. It doesnâ€™t sound like you have a hard time meeting people and are fairly outgoing.,,,,,,,,,,,
1311,"I think for her as a female us growing up and our most sexual experiences, guys couldnâ€™t give a toss about us and our pleasure (thanks porn). The hardest thing for me to adapt was understanding how much pleasure he took from him making me enjoy myself. Very few guys in reality, able bodied or not, actually do that!",,,,,,,,,,,
1312,Good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,
1313,"Appreciate you opening up. I understand where youâ€™re coming from and have felt the same way. At the end of the day you have to remember that you offer her things that other people canâ€™t offer her. Your resilience and strength (although sounds cheesy) is something that she will not be able to find another man who may sexually satisfied. There are gives and takes in relationships and I know it sucks to feel limited, but if you can build awareness about the other parts of her life you are improving it might help you feel better. Shit sucks man, but everything is a choice",,,,,,,,,,,
1314,I talked with my g/f and we both are echoing many of the other comments here.,,,,,,,,,,,
1315,,,,,,,,,,,,
1316,"It is her problem, not yours.  That doesn't mean she is a bad person.  It just means that at this point in her life she isn't ready to be in a relationship where sex isn't ""normal"". (She may never be ready for that.)",,,,,,,,,,,
1317,,,,,,,,,,,,
1318,"I personally have had comments from women like ""If you don't orgasm, then what is the point of sex?""",,,,,,,,,,,
1319,,,,,,,,,,,,
1320,I knew right then that a relationship with that person wouldn't work.,,,,,,,,,,,
1321,,,,,,,,,,,,
1322,You mentioned that your lady doesn't like trying new/different things in bed because it is the one time when she doesn't want to think.  That is a HUGE red flag to me.,,,,,,,,,,,
1323,,,,,,,,,,,,
1324,"If she really wanted things to work out with you, she would be excited to try different things because that would help the relationship succeed.",,,,,,,,,,,
1325,,,,,,,,,,,,
1326,"My girlfriend and I are very open in terms of communication in the bedroom and that is **crucial** for any relationship, but especially one in which a person has a spinal cord injury.",,,,,,,,,,,
1327,,,,,,,,,,,,
1328,"I flat out tell her either before or during sex, ""I don't know if this will work, but I'd like to try.""",,,,,,,,,,,
1329,,,,,,,,,,,,
1330,"...and she says, ""We'll alright, let's give it a go.  If it doesn't work we can try something else.""",,,,,,,,,,,
1331,,,,,,,,,,,,
1332,"The most important thing is that she is caring and understanding regarding everything in terms of my sexual function/ability and because of that we always feel connected and lovey even if, for example, my dick won't go up.  ...and that DOES happen once in a while, but I have a tongue and I have fingers, so...  ;-p",,,,,,,,,,,
1333,,,,,,,,,,,,
1334,"Interestingly enough, though, when I'm having erection issues, my lady doesn't mind at all because that means she gets to try to ""snake charm"" him, as she calls it.  (Most of the time she is successful.  Sometimes she isn't, but she understands that it is a me thing, not a her thing.)",,,,,,,,,,,
1335,,,,,,,,,,,,
1336,The bottom line is that we enjoy EVERYTHING we do regardless of what it is.,,,,,,,,,,,
1337,,,,,,,,,,,,
1338,It sounds like your s/o is overthinking things (which is exactly what she said she didn't want to do).,,,,,,,,,,,

1342,"I do believe that you two need a break from your relationship.  If it is meant to be, it is meant to be.  If not, there are so many other fishies out there and most dolphinitely one of them will click with you in ALL aspects of the relationship.",,,,,,,,,,,
1343,I went the first 6-8 years after injury without orgasm or ejaculation. Depending on your injury level and what not itâ€™s totally possible.  I found a forum of guys using a tens unit to ejaculate. Have been using that ever sense and its worked wonders for me!  Between using tri-mix for Ed that and an intimate rider. Along with other various things in my adult toy box Iâ€™d say Iâ€™ve gotten back to having  a pretty normal sex life.,,,,,,,,,,,
1344,,,,,,,,,,,,
1345,Just saying donâ€™t give up until you have tried all options. A lot of guys use vibrators such as hitachi wands. They make a medical vibrator just for people with SCI called the a ferticare medical vibrator.,,,,,,,,,,,
1346,,,,,,,,,,,,
1347,My  girlfriend I had when I was injured was the same way your talking and it didnâ€™t work out. If only she could see what Iâ€™m capable of now!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,
1348,Iâ€™m a new girlfriend to a T7 complete para. Heâ€™s had a second injury that made it so he needs a lot of medication to get erect. And even then it doesnâ€™t get super hard and goes away quickly. Mostly we do other types of sex.,,,,,,,,,,,
1349,,,,,,,,,,,,
1350,"I had a meltdown the other day after we tried regular sex again because it just seemed weird. But after my bf held me and talked to me I figured out it was because he had been too mechanical and practical. I needed some romance to help me forget that he canâ€™t feel it and all the focus is on me. I needed romantic kissing and touching to bring me into the moment so I could just enjoy the intimacy. Heâ€™s really funny, and now he gets extra dripping wet romantic when he wants to turn me on. Try going slow and romantic and getting her so lost in the mood that she forgets about the medical aspect of what youâ€™re doing. For some women like myself, the focus of sex has always been getting the man off. With the foc",s now c,mplet,ly on,"y pleasure, i",â€™,t,ken,ome,rom,nce to,ake su
1351,"My BF is c5-6 complete, 32 yrs post injury. Like a couple of the other comments, the hardest/weirdest thing was the fact that the focus was on me, especially as previously my aim was to take care of my partner's needs, never my own. I will admit that it does upset me a bit that I can't give back to him in that way.",,,,,,,,,,,
1352,,,,,,,,,,,,
1353,"I found it easy to change what my definition of sex is, especially when he explained to me what he mentally gets out of it. I was never adventurous in that way, until I met him, but now we both come up with new things to try, and different ways of doing things to try and keep it interesting for both of us. I discovered that I quite like being tied up, giving him control that we both enjoy.",,,,,,,,,,,

1357,,,,,,,,,,,,
1358,"I think without proper, honest communication and openness, things will continue as they are. It's sounds to me that it's her who needs to communicate more.",,,,,,,,,,,
1359,"You could suggest different toys to try, and different ways to use them and do things. Being creative that way definitely makes things more exciting for us! You could also maybe try to surprise her by planning ahead to be as ready as you can be, if possible; if he knows I'm not in pain, mine will take his blue ones and make sure he caths right before bed.",,,,,,,,,,,

1365,Sounds like she isnâ€™t really completely comfortable with the situation set. How do you feel about smoking weed? Weed actually makes sex much more physically enjoyable for me. That could be helpful got you both,,,,,,,,,,,
1366,I still havenâ€™t figured any way for me to orgasm yet. Itâ€™s been over 4 years. I donâ€™t really get physical pleasure (at least in my penis) from sex so itâ€™s all mental and feels good to please them. I do have some physical pleasure from my nipples after my injury and she enjoys playing with them so she tries to make sure I am feeling good too but I never get that big release like before my injury.Thanks for the response. The ol tongue and fingers is what I feel I had mastered in the past but she doesnâ€™t like either of those things for some reason so itâ€™s like I had to start over lol. Those were my go to.

I'll wake up the next day in severe pain, or sometimes I wake up the next day not doing that much worse.",,,,,,,,,,,

1378,There's no rhyme or reason to my pain. Or better put if I don't constantly keep up on trying to keep it in shape and cater to it I pay a very dear price. It's like having a 2 yr old crying baby that you need to care for constantly.,,,,,,,,,,,

1387,"You could research something called the Disability Paradox. This is a relatively common phenomenon that people that do no have disabilities will wrongly think that people with disabilities have a low quality of life, while in most research the majority of people with disabilities report having a good or excellent quality of life. Basically disability has less of an impact on your happiness than people that don't have them expect. This comes from the fact that people's expectations get adjusted. Happiness according to a lot of research, relating to disability and in general, is mostly a product of their social relationships, their sense of fulfilment and personal attitudes.

We have relationships, friends, jobs, play sports, etc. It is true that a disability can make some of these things harder, but that is not our fault, it is society's. In general people with disabilities have a lot of resilience, since we live in a world that is not adapted to us, so we are able to deal with things being more difficult.",,,,,,,,,,,

My spinal cord injury isnâ€™t particularly sever, but as a result of it I now know dozens of people with higher level injuries who are full-time wheelchair users.

My sister had to amputate part of her leg and now suffer from phantom pain that comes and goes. It really can't imagine what it would be like to live with that and it sucks that she might have to live with it the rest of her life.

Someone listening closely might hear the occasional whimper and someone watching me will see my body tense and release drastically and often. I feel non-functional.

Lax takes 9-12h to work for me and I only shower at night. So usually Iâ€™ll take lax at 10am when I first wake up > transfer from my wheelchair to commode at around 830pm > head to bathroom > transfer from commode to toilet bowl > start digital stimulation > clean up > transfer back from toilet bowl to commode > shower. This whole process takes ~45m now as compared to 1.5-2h during my first month at home.",,,,,,,,,,,

Even after 11 yrs I think I should visit rehab once more just to hone my skills and learn something new, better. But I will advise against any reclining bed, special mattress of any form to avoid pressure sores. It is important that she is aware of the seriousness of pressures sores and ensures she doesn't get any. And special mattress and reclining beds are more likely to give that. And so is prolonged wetness in private areas at night.",,,,,,,,,,,

I was only on it for a few months anyway. I've noticed that my level of exhaustion affects the severity of my spasms. If I get little to no sleep the night before, my spasms are crazy jerky and violent, and I could injure someone if they're near my legs at that time. I'll also be barely able to shuffle the next day because my legs will want to constantly give out.",,,,,,,,,,,
1819,Like they said itâ€™s spasticity. Itâ€™s your body trying to protect your bones better because most paraplegics and quadriplegics have osteopenia or osteoporosis from the hip on down. Stretching and baclofen are key to helping discomfort. My spasms will twist me up so bad I need to have my PT manipulate my hip. Itâ€™s probably better to see a chiropractor. Iâ€™m a T12/L1 incomplete for about 3.5 years and recently my pain has been through the roof. I need to stretch a lot just to function. Itâ€™s basically a full time job. Meds and stretch.

2009,You know what else I found really helpful is dry needling.  Depending on where you are it might be a PT or an acupuncturist or a massage therapist but I found 1. incredibly painful but it doesnâ€™t hurt for long and was completely worth it because 2. huge increases in range of motion.,,,,,,,,,,,
2010,I use a theragun during PT sessions to help my scaps be less tight as being in a chair those muscles get super tight and then at night I use a head massager on my legs to try and send a signal from down to up. Since signals are sent from the brain down itâ€™s also nice to try and send them the other way. Massaging also helps with spasms and keeping muscles loose. I wasnâ€™t able to feel vibrations two months ago and now I can feel vibrations and sometimes the massage device it self on my upper thighs. Iâ€™m 9 months post.,,,,,,,,,,,

2044,,,,,,,,,,,,
2045,I think the best way to describe it for me is the best analogy is the transition becoming a runner or a gym rat. At first you want to go to the gym or you want to run. Eventually it becomes physical and you just kind of have to do it. That physical side is no longer there.,,,,,,,,,,,
2046,"Pretty much the same - took me 6 months, feeling isn't as good but it works.Advice for fixing wheelchair posture (T4 complete)If you are T4 complete, the muscles needed to maintain a fully upright position are not innervated. You should see a seating specialist for a better seating setup. With the right wheelchair configuration, cushion, and backrest you should be able to propel, reach, whatever you need to do with both arms while still sitting with good posture. There are simple fixes (like adding dump to your wheelchair), more moderate solutions (more contoured backrest) and complex solutions (fully customized seating system, like RIDE)",,,,,,,,,,,
2047,"You already got some great advice, I just wanted to add that if you push a manual chair your muscles in the pec area tend to get more developed and can tighten up, which actually pulls your shoulders inward and gives them that rounded shape that many manual users get.  Try workouts that develop muscles around the upper back and shoulder blades, basically areas that are not worked out by pushing a chair.",,,,,,,,,,,
2048,,,,,,,,,,,,
2049,"Also try opening up the tension in your chest muscles by stretching them. I do this in bed: I lay on my side (and partially toward my back, pillows may be needed behind hips for support) and let one bent arm fall back behind me while squeezing my shoulder blades together, 2-4 times for 10 seconds, then repeat for the other side.  Or any way you can find to stretch the area could help.",,,,,,,,,,,
2050,"Everyone has given solid advice, the only thing I would add is that if you do not have a solid back to your chair that would be the place to start. Also not sure how others feel but having armrests on a manual chair as a t4 sounds fishy. That would mess up my pushing hard out. I would consider how your situation would change without them",,,,,,,,,,,

2053,"After nearly 40 years in a chair, I look like the letter 'C.' And I'm 6'7"". I *used* to have wonderful posture. I've been weightlifting since before my injury; my back muscles are amply strong. But, as others have noted, there just aren't enough muscles still working in the *right* areas to help me straighten out.",,,,,,,,,,,
2054,,,,,,,,,,,,
2055,Best wishes on your endeavor!,,,,,,,,,,,
2056,"I don't know about workouts but a proper wheelchair setup, with the right amount of dump, the right cushion, and a rigid backrest, potentially with deep contour, is where I would start.  Feet/leg placement in the chair can also affect the rotation of your hips which feed into your posture and lumbar lordosis as well.",,,,,,,,,,,
2057,,,,,,,,,,,,
2058,It is surprising a rehab PT says they can't do anything to help.  That sounds weird.  Are they RESNA ATP certified as a seating specialist?,,,,,,,,,,,
2059,How high is the back on your wheelchair and is it almost straight? I have a hard time maintaining a straight posture in a wheelchair that has a back that is too high that doesn't have lumbar support. A wheelchair back that sits lower and contacts less of my upper back allows me to sit straighter.,,,,,,,,,,,

2061,"If you have the capability of pulling your shoulders back so that your shoulder blade pinch inward, then I may be able to strengthen it a bit and improve some, but Iâ€™d also see if you could maybe get a small back brace because prolonged poor posture can cause serious issues later on in life.",,,,,,,,,,,

The neuro can run a EMG/ NCV to validate and ""map"" out the nerves that are causing you issues. Depending where the damage is, they can look at shots and things like radio frequency lesioning. You are limited on shots - they are steroids and cause long term issues to the surrounding tissue. Gabapentin - Elavil and a few other drugs can help. The neuro, try to go to a teaching hospital. You need a top notch one, the test needs to be performed by someone who really is good cause it can affect the outcome of the test.

2207,"Update: I read further in the thread and realized that this is still very ""acute"". It will take a while for the trauma of the injury and subsequent surgery to calm down. I still stand by the comments, but, I would wait until post surgery  and recovery before perusing the EMG / NCV. Let the body recover first, to see what extent you still have the nerve pain. I would also say that PT will be critical. Push thru the pain and make sure he ""flosses"" the nerves in his spine so they do not attach to the scar tissue from surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,
2208,The only suggestion I have is to consult a doctor about Gabapentin. I had severe nerve pain in the beginning of my injury (now 8/9months post) and Gabapentin helped me out tremendously but I no longer take it as Iâ€™ve weened off the med. Long term nerve pain may come and go and that really depends on the extent of the injury. Right now your husband is in spinal shock and once the swelling goes down then the nerve pain may subside.,,,,,,,,,,,

2223,"July 25, he suddenly lost all feeling below his chest due to compression in the spinal column from arthritis, stenosis, bone spurs. The surgeon went in through the throat to chisel out bone growths and put in a plate to hold the column open. Two days after they went in the back and chiseled out more growth in the C1-C7 vertebrae. We think he has a bad bruise slightly lower in the spinal cord that will heal with time and maybe give him more movement. For a guy that had no feeling or function 3 weeks ago, a little toe wiggle is giving us a little hope.Why am I now starting to have bladder accidents?UTI is most likely.

I also feel personally attacked that she said we ought to refrain from illicit substances. What if I'm tryna get laid while in a k-hole?!",,,,,,,,,,,
2305,I think the only reason she said that is it can have an affect on your ability to achieve orgasm/ejaculation. She talks about meds doing that as well.,,,,,,,,,,,

I've had all sorts of crazy experiences. Touch one leg and feel it in the other. Muscle twitches. Most of this has sorted itself out luckily. Now it's weakness and numbness.

The best advice I can pass along is to be patient and do as much as they ask in rehab, but don't be afraid to let them know if something hurts. Even when I couldn't do what was asked of me I tried. As long as it didn't hurt I'd go until my therapist told me to stop. Even if that meant just laying on the table trying to move my legs when they wouldn't.",,,,,,,,,,,

I do, though, have experience of being, along with my OH, the sounding-board and advocate for my adolescent daughter who is a complete T9 (injured at 10yo, now nearly 14). As a result of that journey, my OH has been invited as a guest speaker a couple of times for a seminar/symposium for PT and OT students at our local university, primarily on the subject of using para-sport in rehab... so hopefully our combined thoughts may resonate a bit, especially for any pediatric rehab you may be involved in",,,,,,,,,,,
2483,,,,,,,,,,,,
2484,"1. What were the questions going through your mind when finding out about your injury? -- initially she was too much scared/confused to think much beyond ""what happened? Why don't my legs work?"" and so on. There was a lot of the classic grief progression (why can't it just all go back to normal? Why me/us?) and then for us as parents, a lot of practical questions - dealing with insurance companies, lawyers, home renovation specialists, etc. By the time daughter got out of ICU and moving towards rehab, some of those early questions were a bit more settled. With encouragement from her superb medical and therapy team, most of rehab was focused on ""how can I do this"" rather than ""why can't I do that."" Make that yo",r focus,as fa,as yo,can.,,,,,,,
2485,"2. What were the initial challenges (physical, emotional, functional, etc) going through rehab and what did your therapist do to help you stay motivated? Or what did you wish they could have done to better help you? -- Early physical challenges were the basics: sitting up, maintaining seated balance, transferring bed-to-chair, chair-to-floor, into and out of a vehicle, etc. Bowel and bladder function, and learning to self-cath (as a pubescent girl... my OH was completely brilliant about that as I wasn't much help as a dad!) - bowel stuff was a different story, though, as abdominal trauma had led to bowel resection and an ileostomy, so stoma management was rolled into everything else).

2487,"4. What were resources that helped you? And what were resources of information that could have helped you sooner? -- We're in Ontario, the SCI Association of Ontario sent in a peer mentor (in her mid-30s, had been injured as a teenager, went on to play para-sport at a national level, get married, have kids...) who was completely awesome. The inpatient rehab centre (Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital) has a whole library on-site full of both consumer-appropriate and more academically-focused literature, and a full staff of psychological and social worker support for patients (and, importantly, for their families). All of that was invaluable. Access to adaptive sports, ADL resources, and play equipme",t was k,"y, to",- it,as helpful fo,ou,d,ught,r t,be,reminde,"that,"
2488,"5. What helped build better rapport with your therapist? -- Again, from the perspective of a parent, we were most impressed that our daughter's PT was easily able to switch gears from explaining things in kid-friendly terms, then addressing us (but never, ever, talking across our daughter or speaking about her in the third person while she was listening) as parents to go into a little more depth. She realized early on that our needs were best met by understanding the ""why"" as well as the ""what"" and was happy to take the time to explain her process. Her ability to find motivation to work hard, even when our daughter just wanted to curl up in a ball, played an enormous part in a successful inpatient rehab stay.",,,,,,,,,,,
2489,"6. What was the most important thing you learned from rehab? -- Another one where I probably have a different perspective as a parent of a child with an SCI. For me, the one key learning is to know how and when to offer help, and when to acknowledge that, although daughter might take longer to do something, it's really really important for her that she does it herself until she decides to ask for assistance. That might be something as mundane as putting a sock on an uncooperative foot, or getting the jug of OJ from the back of the fridge - or it might be helping her into her hockey sledge or basketball chair, or talking to the transportation agents about her need for an aisle chair to get on and off a plane.",,,,,,,,,,,
2490,"7. Other than your therapist, did you have a mentor? What did you learn from them? -- OMG yes! So many different people! It ""helped,"" I suppose, that daughter's accident made the local news so people were like ""oh, you're \*that\* kid"" - but from the first visit from our SCIAO mentor while still in ICU, to the sledge hockey club, to a local resident who has lived with an acquired SCI for 40+ years and invited us to check out the modifications to his house, everybody we have met along the way has added to our store of knowledge and resources. If you get the opportunity to encourage your patients to seek advice from those who've been in their situation before, do so!

I met my now ex-wife after my injury and have found a lot of success dating, since the divorce a few years ago, using a combo of dating apps and going to bars/clubs to meet new people. As for the other stuff, you may want to look into a viagra prescription. Not being able to orgasm sucks but over time you may find that the ability comes back - hard to say.

2521,,,,,,,,,,,,
2522,"To answer your first question, I find honesty is the best policy.  After my very bitter divorce, and the obligatory healing period afterwards, I was ready to date, but had grown to detest drama and the usual bullshit that typically comes with dating.  So on my profiles, I made sure there were pictures of me in the chair, I talked about it, but I also tried to make sure that people knew it didn't define me.  Not unlike able-bodied dating, women love confidence. And I found out men do too. When you're not in your 20s, you just don't have the desire to fake it anymore. So people love you for who you are, or they can gtfo.  I know it's corny, but the chair is kind of an asshole filter.

2524,"Anyway, to answer your second question I feel it's important to tell you that one of the men I dated prior to my current guy was actually a C6/C7 complete quad.  Sure, I suppose I was a little more open-minded being in a chair myself. But he was definitely far less independent than I.  Penetrative sex for us was super rare (I would climb on top and motion my body with my arms. It was exhausting lol) There was a lot of foreplay, a lot of touching, and I could have kissed him forever. We both just had to alter our expectations. Sex wasn't going to be what it used to be for either of us. So we found other ways to feel sexy, feel good, and just have fun.

2525,,,,,,,,,,,,
2526,"All of that to say, is it easy to find someone willing to see you and not your chair? No. It absolutely isn't. But let's be fair, dating even able-bodied sucks. It's just a process that you have to go through, and initiation before you can find that special someone. My boyfriend isn't a saint for dating me, because I'm awesome ðŸ˜�. But he is an honest to goodness good person because he took the time to get to know me.",,,,,,,,,,,

2530,"C7 incomplete here, most definitely understand what you going through mentally right now, Iâ€™ve been through those motions, others in this forum probably has as well at some point in their journey. What changed for me, and I can only speak for myself, is accepting who I am, and loving ME first, and understanding, I am still ME. The process of getting to that level of clarity of self acceptance, and love is painful, emotional, and long (took me 9 years) but in the end itâ€™s worth it. You end of finding your self and becoming self-aware, learning new things about yourself, and regaining that same pre-injury confidence of not more along the way.",,,,,,,,,,,

2533,,,,,,,,,,,,
2534,"This all comes full circle to relationships and dating. No human being can fill the void of love that your missing within yourself. A person can provide a level of love youâ€™ve never experienced, but until you love you first, you will always battle with â€œam I good enoughâ€� which is unhealthy to any relationship because you canâ€™t hide it. It will show.  Once you reach the level of â€œI am more than good enoughâ€� the universe will take care of the rest.",,,,,,,,,,,

Since my injury, I have found the most wonderful woman who loves me for me and not who I once was. She is the greatest! There were some hurdles initially but we managed to get over them.

2543,Ejaculation gets tricky on the other hand. Iâ€™m a t5 para complete so no feeling....  I use a tens unit to ejaculate. But there are many options It seems like from what Iâ€™ve read vibrators tend to work easier on incomplete injuries than complete. But they to have an extensive range. From a hitachi wand and the hot octopuss vibrator to medical grade ones like the vibrect and ferticare.,,,,,,,,,,,
2544,,,,,,,,,,,,
2545,But somewhere in there you should find a way to ejaculate. Personally Iâ€™ve tried every vibrator except the ferticare and none worked. If you try the hot octopuss personally Iâ€™d just put the money towards a ferticare cuz I have one and itâ€™s just a 170$ paper weight lol.  At least the ladies like my hitachi lol,,,,,,,,,,,

2562,,,,,,,,,,,,
2563,"2) This is something I only learned about more recently and am still completely new to it, but have you heard of tantric sex? From my limited understanding, it is a slow form of sex with the aim of building a deeper emotional and spiritual connection with your partner that is supposed to lead to longer and more pleasurable orgasms even if intercourse doesn't happen. The good people at r/tantricsex can help you if you're interested.",,,,,,,,,,,
2564,,,,,,,,,,,,
2565,"About telling a woman about your issues, do you mean in general as a quadriplegic or specifically sex-related? You should hold off on the sex stuff unless it is understood at the beginning that you two just want to bang. If you want a long-term relationship, talk about yourself like hobbies, interests, etc. before diving into sex. Unless you are planning to date online for a while instead of meeting online then in person within a week, you'd be jumping the gun to talk about sex before a physical date. If you mean general issues, too much info at once may overwhelm her. Take it slow, get to know each other as people, and answer any questions she has when she asks or you need to explain something.",,,,,,,,,,,

2571,"Honesty does sound like the best policy. That's funny you call it the ""asshole filter"" - I like that. It's very true though, you want someone who can see past the chair and past your deficiencies. However i feel like a lot of the dating apps encourage that 2 millisecond decision making, which usually relies on the more shallow, pretentious thought processes. That further tightens the pool of potentials. But!, I guess that further reinforces your point to invest in a monetary-based platform, where people are more committed to finding a lasting relationship. Interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,

I caught myself recently thinking how im so paranoid about my disability that im walking on eggshells and not being myself.

Question is below! :)Usually, lower level injuries lead to a flaccid (or atonic, sometimes called non-reflex) bladder. That means you're unlikely to leak unless your bladder is literally overfilling (unlike a reflex bladder, where involuntary spasms can cause leakage). So you could try increasing the frequency of your cathing (every 3-4 hours, for example) for a period of time, and if you're still getting discharge on your underwear that would suggest it's vaginal discharge rather than urine. If it's whitish and thicker than water, that's another good indication that it's vaginal d",scharge,and n,t urin,.,,,,,,,

A key for many women is exploring sensations around other areas - mouth, nipples, fingers, etc. Your partner sounds like a good person to try some experimenting with - what if you both try sex without penetration? Once he realizes you are enjoying yourself too he could unlearn that expectation about needing to be able to give you an orgasm in the traditional way.

I would speak to him almost every other day to understand how life will be when I get back to work. And I had decided then itself, I will not waste my energy trying to walk.

3091,"I'm in the UK, and anecdotally I'd say that we're more reticent to overly sterilise with antibacterial gels, etc because it can inhibit your body's inherent ability to fight off infections, and antibacterial resistance is a real problem. I rarely get UTIs and the only thing I take to prevent/treat them is D Mannose (I get a powder that I add to my smoothie, but I only use it when travelling or if I think I already have an infection). I used to buy those urine testing strips, which were really useful in the early days of my injury, but since UTIs aren't common for me these days I don't really keep them in stock any more (they tend to have a limited shelf life). But everyone is different. Have you had a UTI or o",her inf,ction,since,our injury?,,,,,,,

3093,"You might also find the SCI Owners' Club Facebook group helpful - it shouldn't be taken as medical advice, but you'll get a LOT of real-world experiences from people who've been living with spinal cord injuries for years or decades. Again anecdotally, but I'd say your routine is in the minority and I'd agree more on the side of your urologist's office in that it's overkill. But obviously, I am not a doctor and not familiar with your specific case or how likely you are to get UTIs so please take everything I've said with that in mind.",,,,,,,,,,,
3094,"The alcohol is overkill IMO. Menâ€™s anatomy might be different, but that is a big no no for the ladies. An iodine swab should have already done the job - although nobodyâ€™s told me to wait 15 seconds. I imagine thatâ€™s to let whatever bacteria die, and then you wipe them away with the alcohol? If so rinsing with clean water after the iodine should do the trick. Iâ€™ve always just let the iodine do its job and go in right after.",,,,,,,,,,,
3095,,,,,,,,,,,,
3096,"Some urologists prescribe antibiotics left and right, some allow bacteria to exist and prescribe only when youâ€™ve got a fever.

3098,"Perhaps your hands could be cleaner though. If youâ€™re washing, then touching your pants and getting everything in position youâ€™re hands are no longer sterile. You could use sanitizer just before you touch the catheter, or put on gloves, or just make sure your not touching any part of the catheter that makes it in. Again, with male anatomy this might be out of the question.",,,,,,,,,,,

3120,I am female and use baby wipes after washing my hands and using a towel that is just for me and my hands. I'm methodical and clean but still get infections and sepsis three times. Unfortunate side effect. I did start to trial something called hyastat (sp?) that they put into the bladder via the urethra and was infection free for nine months. It lines the bladder to help stop bacteria settling. Unfortunately with covid I've no been able to have it done. I've had a couple of infections but not bad enough (almost) to be hospitalised.

I take Methenamine to help combat the onset of a UTI. My urologist also gives me a mild antibiotic that I take a few times a week to also help. I might also suggest making sure your really clean after a bowel movement, which may or may not apply to you. Additionally, check what youâ€™re drinking. Stay away from sugar drinks.

3147,"My biggest suggestion is to seek out a rehabilitation nurse to help sort through some of these  things because there is so much going on. it sounds like you are trying all the major options, but it is definitely a good idea to try to get off the bladder meds as they almost all cause constipation. I get a ton of bladder spasms without the botox, and I'd suggest you talk with your physiatrist about bladder augmentation, or bladder implants, that sort of thing. There are some really interesting new options out there right now.",,,,,,,,,,,
3148,"I'm four years out from my injury, incomplete L1. There are many ups and downs on this journey, as you well know. Something that has helped me manage my irritation and frustration with things has been seeing a rehabilitation psychologist who specializes in working with people with traumatic injuries. Honestly, the ups and downs are still there and it's a constant change, but therapy has really helped me to manage my emotions and to not let my pain and irritation and lifestyle changes get the best of me, because it is beyond frustrating at times.

One of the things we suffer from is dry skin and itâ€™s the messages going to the brain can be misinterpreted because of the SCI. Other solutions can be drugs for neurological pain. There are lots of them and none really good for you as they act on your nervous system basically in your brain chemistry.

Usually these drugs are used in larger doses to treat mental disorders like depression etc.",,,,,,,,,,,

The handrail is really helpful for transferring and for ambulatory people to hang on to when getting across the beach to the water.

This isn't the case for people with chronic non-traumatic issues like Spina Bifida and tethered cord. The same principles apply  to many other forms of neurological injury - the earlier you get to surgery to correct the problem, the better.

3245,Thx. Appreciate it.,,,,,,,,,,,
3246,Cool. Iâ€™m using a walker at times. Still using a wheelchair for long days outside. I also have the toe-offs. My quads are doing nicely but itâ€™s taking time to build hammies and glutes.,,,,,,,,,,,
3247,"I'm an L1 incomplete as well and just based off of this video, our presentation looks really similar! What mobility devices (if any) have you been using? I generally use forearm crutches but I'm starting to work towards using canes for shorter distances. You look like you're crushing it dude!

3248,This is awesome. I'm about to get a puppy in September. Can't seem to find good resources for wheelchair puppy training. Any hints?,,,,,,,,,,,
3249,"Is it going to be a big dog or small dog? I'm not gunna lie, training a large dog from a wheelchair is not for the faint hearted! The most important thing to get down is lead control. If your dog can't walk without pulling then you're screwed from a chair user's perspective! In a chair you can't brace like a person on 2 feet can, if your dog sees a squirrel and pulls, you'll end up on the floor!",,,,,,,,,,,
3250,,,,,,,,,,,,
3251,"For walking, I use a halty lead, I clip one end around my waist (most secure part of me) and the other end to my pup's harness. I trained her to always walk on the right side of my chair, so she won't get tangled in the wheels. I started by having my partner push me, whilst I fed her treats for walking on a nice slack lead beside me. Once she got the hang of that, I started going out myself, but accompanied. I only started walking her alone once I was 100% sure she would not pull.",,,,,,,,,,,

It gets stronger usually if there is something wrong and I take Lyrica on the highest dose to try and Control it. However, it doesn't seem to help much. If anyone else has some solutions, I'd love to hear it as well.",,,,,,,,,,,
3256,"I was told that with more movement that I may get more nerve pain, I mainly use desensitizing techniques to lessen it (ice, heat, and taking a textured clothe to the areas). I was told for fiery nerve pain specifically, elavil is best. I took it for while and it helped a lot even at low dosage, and eventually I stopped when my nerves finally calmed down a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,

3258,"Iâ€™m still pretty new in my injury as well, so Iâ€™m not that experienced, but these are what helped me.",,,,,,,,,,,
3259,"Unfortunately it feels like a lot of medical professionals only know general information about SCIâ€™s. I still get nerve pain, but itâ€™s a lot more tolerable now. I use to not be able to lay on my side because I felt like it was burning. Itâ€™s so different for everybody though, so it may take a lot of experimentation to figure out what helps. Good luck and I hope the best for you!",,,,,,,,,,,
3260,"I hoping I can add a little here. Firstly, everyone of course is different. That being said, weâ€™ve all had some very similar pain/spasm experience. I had no nerve pain or spasms until about 7/8 months. Then bam! Right quad with the burning, muscle cramp and pain (L1 burst incomplete). They started after my PT increased and I started using 4AP (4 aminopyridine). Doc told me it was a good thing as the nerves weâ€™re trying to reconnect. I was feeling like the sense of feeling was moving , albeit slowly, farther down my leg but man do the contractions and pain kick my ass. The more Iâ€™d workout, the more they would intensify which makes sense to me. I sometimes think I was told it was a good thing to keep my m",nd off,t.

Iâ€™m walking with a clever-lite right now and can do longer distances (not extremely long yet). No two SCIs are the same, keep working those muscles though if you see yourself recovering. Even if you feel like itâ€™s moving but itâ€™s not, keep trying.",,,,,,,,,,,
3263,"I declined lyrica at about a month into my injury because I felt it wasn't helping anyway and I didn't want anything to affect the communication between my upper body and lower body. I figured if it was numbing pain it was also interrupting signals, potentially. Just my take :)",,,,,,,,,,,
3264,Thanks for sharing! Very interesting indeed!!,,,,,,,,,,,
3265,,,,,,,,,,,,
3266,"Where I am located, despite my asking of different professionals, very little, if anything, has been shared about nerve pain or what to expect with it.Thank you. This helps more than you can know! Thanks!Very interesting that's what the doctor told you. I also find it very interesting that your feeling was that the ""sense of feeling"" was slowing moving down your leg. I have gained skin sensitivity well below the navel, when originally I couldn't feel a touch even an inch or so above my navel when the injury occured.",,,,,,,,,,,
3267,,,,,,,,,,,,
3268,"As you said everyone is different yet similarities are there as well. I'm T12 Complete, 11 months post injury and I still don't get any spasticity. No cramps yet either and hope it stays that way.",,,,,,,,,,,

3270,I've watched the stairs video you posted and it's amazing! Your efforts are paying off!!Thank you! It's great to hear your perspective. Congrats on gaining such great movement thus far. Keep at it!! I (and others I'm sure) gain a lot of inspiration from such experiences as yours as well as similar experiences of others here.,,,,,,,,,,,
3271,,,,,,,,,,,,
3272,"I'll keep at it of course. I'm trying to be very much in touch with my body and paying careful attention to whatever I feel including new sensations or movements as well as keeping a record of how older movements and sensations are holding up over time. Any little gain is motivating and quite encouraging.My SCI happened when I was pregnant, here is me right before I gave birth. My baby just turned 1m old today.

3275,"Is it bad to not want to explain it when people ask why you're in a wheelchair?First of all, you don't have to explain anything. It's something very personal to you and strangers don't have the right to hear about your personal story. Would you expect someone to reply to a question about how they lost their virginity? Of course not. That's how personal this question can be. If people don't understand that, fuck em.",,,,,,,,,,,
3276,,,,,,,,,,,,
3277,"Now some advice how to deal with this question for yourself. I have different 'scripts' for different situations and different kinds of people. The short version is just ""I had an accident"". It answers the question and if they ask more, I can tell them politely that I don't want to talk about it. If I don't want to talk about it, but they're nice people I will say something like: ""I had an accident ten years ago and it was pretty bad, but now I'm doing pretty well. It's a pretty long story and I've told it a lot so it's just a bit of a... boring conversation. When I know people better I will tell them the specifics of the accident and my rehabilitation journey, but also how I dealt with it and how it made me g",ow.

3278,,,,,,,,,,,,
3279,"In all these situations it is important for you to know that *I control* the conversation. It is *my life*, so I don't talk about things I don't want to talk about. When I say ""I had an accident"", people always assume that I had a car accident. If I don't want the conversation to continue in this path, I won't correct them, even if it is not true. If you answer with a short answer, they should pick up the hint that you don't want to talk about it. If they then continue to ask, they are making the faux pas.",,,,,,,,,,,
3280,,,,,,,,,,,,
3281,Hope my perspective on this can help you in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,
3282,"Tbh I just base it on what I want to explain at the time. Sometime they get the full ""Oh I fell snowboarding in 2015 and broke my neck/damaged my spinal cord and then inflammation didn't go away  and that led to another lesion (and diagnosis of inactive MS) in 2019 making me an incomplete C2 C5/6 quadriplegic"" and other times they get the ""...can't walk""",,,,,,,,,,,
3283,,,,,,,,,,,,
3284,"It's not really their business most of the time, so whether or not I give a good explanation is kinda my decision.",,,,,,,,,,,
3285,My boyfriend usually says something along the lines of â€œlaser tag accidentâ€� or â€œhot dog eating competitionâ€�. We watch them try to process the information and laugh about it later.,,,,,,,,,,,
3286,,,,,,,,,,,,
3287,"Took him 2 years to tell me and thatâ€™s okay, it was a traumatic experience and traumatic experiences arenâ€™t exactly small talk or first date conversations. You have no reason to explain just to settle someoneâ€™s passing curiosity.",,,,,,,,,,,
3288,"Different story based on situation is my take too! Based on the person I am conversing with, I decide which story to tell. And no, I don't tell the same story to everyone. This also makes people aware that Spinal cord injury can have variety of causes: a fall be it from 1st floor or from a branch 6 feet above the ground, a wrong slip in the bathroom, road traffic accident, a wrong dive into the pool.

I am no longer bothered with walking part. But I do tell different stories, sometimes to instil fear / horror, and some times for fun. They'd even get personal. Am I married, do I have kids. And life must be tough and bla bla. But like I said, based on how the conversation starts, my story develops.",,,,,,,,,,,

3375,"I currently have almost the same issue. Although, Iâ€™ve been injured a lot longer and Iâ€™m currently on bed rest at home getting up once or twice a week so I donâ€™t lose too much muscle mass or movement for mental health. Everything is healing steadily, after six weeks about 30% healed. I typically stay up for 16 hours a day and will have to increase pressure relief in the future and take more rest. The cushion needs to be assessed by a pressure clinic.",,,,,,,,,,,
3376,"I had a pretty bad sore on my hip/butt cheek a few years ago, likely started from a zit that got infected. Not nearly as bad as yours, but it took about 6 months to a year to fully heal. For many of us it's tough to see the back of us, and because of this it's our responsibility to voice to those helping us the importance of communication of issues that even seem minor.",,,,,,,,,,,
3377,,,,,,,,,,,,
3378,"I was not on full bed rest, but I spent a lot more time in bed. I also sleep and lay in bed on my stomach. To deal with mine, I'd spend the first few hours of my day, about 3 hours out of bed. This included my routine of stretching, BM, and eating. I'd then get back in bed for 4-5 hours, on my stomach. Back in my chair for a couple hours in the evening maybe 3ish hours, to eat/do whatever, then back in bed for the night. The time in my chair I'd try to do almost excessive pressure relief.",,,,,,,,,,,
3379,,,,,,,,,,,,
3380,"It took some time but this worked for me. I saw a wound care specialist at a local hospital once a week for a few months early on. I cleaned the wound and put new dressings on it 2-3 times a week, don't use hydrogen peroxide or harsh cleaners. I was told to use regular hand soap/water.",,,,,,,,,,,
3381,,,,,,,,,,,,
3382,"I am by no means suggesting to ignore doctors, or say every one of them lacks experience. That being said I often feel many GPs don't deal with quads on a regular, and you should consider asking for a specialist referral if you feel it's relevant.",,,,,,,,,,,
3383,,,,,,,,,,,,
3384,"Best of luck, being in bed all day isn't ideal, but pressure sores are a long term heal for many of us with sitting and poor circulation.",,,,,,,,,,,
3385,"http://www.thespinalfoundation.org/skin-care-best-practices/ this is the standard guideline that we follow in India. Many peer trainers /peer mentors use this as guidelines for skin care approach. This should be something, you should be adopting into your daily life.",,,,,,,,,,,
3386,,,,,,,,,,,,
3387,"Grade 3 ulcers: to start with, stop any sittings, follow the log rolling position change rule, every 2 hrs. Never lie supine, always prone, on your stomach. At least until the sore heals. Leave the sore area aerated preferably covered with just a cloth. I know for lower grade ulcers and what we need to do. I had grade 1 ulcers, a couple of times, I stopped sitting except for my bowel program. And in 14 days it healed. I used to clean the ulcer with saline water. But for grade 3,i dont know. Let me check and get back. I will share what we recommend in India. And you can follow something similar. If it is something that you can adopt.",,,,,,,,,,,
3388,,,,,,,,,,,,
3389,"Skin care routine, day in day out check with a mirror or at least thrice a week check the buttocks area, near the balls, lower spine, under thigh for skin condition. Use coconut oil or body lotion. I use vaseline body lotion and amply apply in these areas where pressure sore is more likely, i.e. Buttocks and under thigh. Strictly follow the push up policy every 20 or 30 mins while sitting on wheelchair. By push up I mean, hold my wheels and lift my body for 15-20 seconds. Of course I am a a paraplegic. My friend who is a quad, I think c5-c6, he relieves the pressure by moving sideways (as much as he can). He also uses a cushion to sit and never sits on hard surfaces. It's always some for of soft surface.",,,,,,,,,,,
3390,"Pushing through like a beast. 3 years post injury L1 burst incomplete (other broken bones too). Just posting to show my progress and maybe inspire someone else to keep going. Thanks to my wife Iâ€™m never stopping.Your form looks solid, engaging those hip flexors and quads to move that leg up instead of swinging it around.",,,,,,,,,,,

3401,Nothing but respect man!,,,,,,,,,,,
3402,Rock those weak a$$ stairs.,,,,,,,,,,,
3403,Wooo!! Fantastic progress dude ðŸ‘�,,,,,,,,,,,
3404,"Well done!! I remember after my kyphosis surgery a few years ago I couldn't walk for about a week and my right leg was completely numb and I could barely put any pressure on it. After about 7 days in hospital I had to walk down some steps so I could get the blood moving in my leg. I was shaking like leaf and I had to hold onto about 3 people and the banister, but when I finally managed to walk down a few I started crying because after 7 days I was seeing progress. Again, well done sir!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,
3405,Excellent work! Stairs are a beast - you should be proud!,,,,,,,,,,,
3406,,,,,,,,,,,,
3407,"If I may ask, are you wearing some sort of brace on your legs? If so, what kind and do they help mitigate spasms?",,,,,,,,,,,
3408,,,,,,,,,,,,
3409,"I ask because my husband's biggest obstacle in walking again (besides getting the right prosthesis - lost his left leg when he was injured) is spasms in his ""good"" leg. He got a good rhythm down on his first prosthetic leg, but his right leg will spasm unpredictably and send him to the floor. His physical therapist has basically said that's the only thing holding him back from progressing with walking.",,,,,,,,,,,
3410,"I have â€œtoe offâ€� carbon fiber braces on both legs. They help walking as they essentially take the place of my calf muscles ( as I understand it). They do not help with spasms other than the more Iâ€™m up walking and exercising, the less frequent they are. Hope this helps.",,,,,,,,,,,
3411,VERY good.,,,,,,,,,,,
3412,,,,,,,,,,,,
3413,"What most people don't realize is that only some of the needed muscles are working, other muscles are working but have limited function as only part of the muscle is receiving signals, while others are getting the wrong signals. It takes us at least 300% more energy to perform tasks like this than the average human. I tell people to imagine that they are wearing a backpack with 200 or 300 lbs in it. Not just for a few minutes until they get tired or it gets hard to do...all day.",,,,,,,,,,,

Only one thing is certain - it ain't T5CompleteLiz's.As long as we are posting our cool X-rays, check out this cool bridge I have now instead of my L1(non-recoverable burst)!Great. Iâ€™m an L1 (3 years out) and walk a bit with a walker but building my hamstrings and glutes is taking forever. The numbness and sensitivity I experienced took about 6 months to subside as the swelling around the surgery site and spinal cord went down. Good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,
3425,Wow crazy!  How long ago?  Whatâ€™s your current prognosis regarding paralysis and mobility?,,,,,,,,,,,
3426,"About 5 months ago now.  By some sort of miracle I was off the walker by week 3 and I am fairly independently mobile right now.  Still a lot of numbness and/or pain from knees to nips, but every day is a bit better.Research Study on SCIMy late wife died from ALS in January 2010.  I often thought about suicide after her death. Our daughter was 12 when her mom (my wife and best friend) died.  Knowing that I had a 12 year old daughter who lost her mother to ALS got me through 2010 to 2017. if I died, our daughter would have lost both of her parents.",,,,,,,,,,,
3427,,,,,,,,,,,,
3428,My spinal cord injury took place inside a hospital in September 2017. I certainly contemplated suicide after I came home from 67 days in the hospital.,,,,,,,,,,,
3429,,,,,,,,,,,,
3430,"I walked into the ER with a sharp pain in my right side. They told me that I was constipated. A higher power got me admitted to the hospital where I languished for five days, unable to move my legs, urinate on my own or have a poop on my own.",,,,,,,,,,,
3431,,,,,,,,,,,,
3432,"On day 5, they tried to give me an MRI.  There were major complications. I pleaded for a CT Scan at around 1 AM.  When the Radiologist read my CT, he said ""There is compression on the cord.""  That is like yelling ""Fire"" in a theatre. I underwent an emergency six hour surgery on my vertebrae so that they could cut the bone closest to the skin on my back, remove the bone (spinous process) and scrape out the pus.  I had to have a second operation where they opened up the old operation and took off more bone in my lumbar region.",,,,,,,,,,,
3433,,,,,,,,,,,,
3434,"A few days later, I went into full cardiac arrest for 6-7 minutes.  I suffered major brain damage from no oxygen to my brain for 6-7 minutes. They got my heart started.  They put a stent in the right coronary artery. I was having seizures. They put me into a coma and on life support for four days. They installed a heart assist pump in my descending aorta to take some of the load off of my heart..  When I woke up after four days on a ventilator, I ripped the hoses going into me out of my body. They tied my hands to the bed rail. I pleaded with them to untie my hands. They would not do that for some time.",,,,,,,,,,,
3435,,,,,,,,,,,,
3436,"They sent me to an inpatient rehab hospital.  At the rehab hospital, I could not move my body to get out of bed.  I fell out of my bed and a very loud bed alarm went off and all the nurses and staff came running into my room.",,,,,,,,,,,
3437,,,,,,,,,,,,
3438,"Over time, the rehab staff taught me how to transfer myself from my hospital bed to a wheelchair.  I learned how to move out of the wheel chair onto a shower chair.  They started to reteach me how to walk using a walker.  They tested my aptitude and told me that I was in the 10th percentile.  They said that my brain was so damaged that I would never be able to comprehend what had happened to me.",,,,,,,,,,,
3439,,,,,,,,,,,,
3440,"When I got home, I was in a wheel chair. I was really depressed and thought often about the best way to kill myself.  I did not want to shoot myself. What if I missed?  (This happens.)",,,,,,,,,,,
3441,,,,,,,,,,,,
3442,I decided a plastic bag over my head with a tank of helium going through a hose into the inside of my plastic bag was the best route.   I had a tank of helium in my work shed.,,,,,,,,,,,
3443,,,,,,,,,,,,
3444,I ditched the wheelchair and bought the tallest walker I could buy.  It is called a Rollator.,,,,,,,,,,,
3445,,,,,,,,,,,,
3446,I will have to insert a catheter to pee each time I need to drain my bladder for the rest of my life. I will use enemas for the rest of my life to take a poop.  I flush water up my anus to help the feces come out.,,,,,,,,,,,
3447,,,,,,,,,,,,
3448,My spinal cord injury cut off the blood supply to my urogenital nerves. I could have sex the night before I walked into the ER.  My SCI caused me to become impotent.,,,,,,,,,,,
3449,,,,,,,,,,,,
3450,"After I got home from the hospital, I used to look at a particular light in our house and think about the best way of killing myself.  What kept me from killing myself was the fact that our daughter was now 19 and she still needed a dad.",,,,,,,,,,,
3451,,,,,,,,,,,,
3452,I relearned how to walk and graduated from the Rollator to a cane. I fall occasionally. I have relearned how to drive a car.,,,,,,,,,,,

3454,"I am 68. I still work full time.  I met a nice lady on Match in 2012, two years after my wife's death from ALS.  What keeps me going?  What keeps me going. The fact that my heart stopped for 6-7 minutes made me think that I must have a purpose in life.",,,,,,,,,,,
3455,,,,,,,,,,,,
3456,"What keeps me from contemplating suicide anymore.  The reasons for me to not kill myself are my daughter (now 23), my GF, my job and our dog.",,,,,,,,,,,
3457,,,,,,,,,,,,
3458,"I go fishing by myself in my 22 foot center console boat to a fishing hole that is 50 miles out into the Gulf of Mexico. I usually go fishing 50 miles offshore by myself.  If the seas are running 3-4 feet, it takes me three hours to get to the 50 mile-offshore fishing hole.",,,,,,,,,,,

3460,"I have bought a lot of safety gear that I keep in my boat. I always wear an inflatable life jacket and if the outboard motor is running, the kill switch lanyard is attached to my life jacket.",,,,,,,,,,,
3461,,,,,,,,,,,,
3462,"If the seas are still up when it is dark and it is time for me to start the motor and drive the boat back to the boat ramp, the ride back will still take me three hours.  I am looking at buying a satellite phone as there is no cell phone coverage 50 miles from land (out in the Gulf of Mexico). I hope that my employer will let me work until I am 73.  I find meaning in my work.  I find meaning in my relationships with my daughter, my GF and our loyal dog.",,,,,,,,,,,

3466,I don't know if any of this makes any sense. Thank you for reading my wandering thoughts.,,,,,,,,,,,
3467,"50 miles is 80.47 kmOnline dating seems impossibleI've been paralyzed C6/C7 for over 2 years now. I've started dating my girlfriend right after the accident,  while I was in hospital.  2 yeare in and I cant wait to be single again. I know it's different for everyone and I'm still dealing with the stress and anxiety but my personal opinion is you have to first find piece within yourself before you start dating again. Here is couple of things that worked for me to get out of very dark places I was falling into:",,,,,,,,,,,
3468,"1. Try to always stay busy reading, audio books, video games(harder for quads but doable)",,,,,,,,,,,
3469,"2. Have a goal to learn something new and master it, sense of accomplishment after sci is enormously important for mental health. I've heard hot to bake sourdough, cook with limited hand function. I've just started reading about photography and most importantly I'm growning out my beard that requires daily maintenance:)",,,,,,,,,,,
3470,"3. Have something to look forward to. New hobby/activity scheduled for the week end. I've never been a fan of mma before but now Saturday is a fight night for me I get excited following pre fight interviews and keeping track of Twitter interactions.  This works for me for you might be a Saturday meet up with friends, game night, cook or something that grabs your interest.",,,,,,,,,,,
3471,"4. When I first got injured people told me to give it 2-3 years and it will get better. I didn't believe them. But time does heal a little bit, and with sci little bit relief can be huge. I still have days when I let myself grief but I can see what they meant.",,,,,,,,,,,
3472,5. When you feel really down take deep breath and concentrate on breathing. I know it sound silly but breathing exercises do miracles for me.,,,,,,,,,,,
3473,,,,,,,,,,,,
3474,"Honestly there's a lot of things that might work for you. Every injury is different and we all deal with it differently. My advice is find some balance on your own, allow yourself time to heal and only then start dating. Maybe by that time pandemic will be no moreðŸ¤—",,,,,,,,,,,
3475,"You've only been at it for a few days?  Patience is needed here.  Online dating means you've got to play the long game.  It takes a while to get matches, and then to move from online to actual in-person dates, then you might have a handful of first dates before you even get second dates.",,,,,,,,,,,
3476,,,,,,,,,,,,
3477,"You may get someone who expresses interest online, maybe sends you messages, but it never moves to real-life dating.  This is very common. Or you may have a good first text conversation with someone who then blocks your number.  Or you may have a first date with someone that goes well and then never have another.  It's all part of dating, unfortunately.",,,,,,,,,,,
3478,,,,,,,,,,,,
3479,"It's easy for us to blame this on our disability, and in some cases, we may be right...but honestly, this is all part of dating for just about everyone.  I'm not saying that we as wheelchair users don't experience a special type of bullshit when it comes to finding partners, I'm just saying that you shouldn't put every instance of rejection down to your chair. Some people are just dicks...some are crazy, or rude, or immature...and sometimes it IS you.  Or maybe you're just not compatible. Don't focus on your chair so much that you become blind to the other things that are going on.",,,,,,,,,,,
3480,One of you guys asked for my Tinder Profile. I accidentally rejected your DM. Please send a I'm agien oopsie,,,,,,,,,,,
3481,I met my boyfriend on match. Weâ€™ve been dating 2 years now. Iâ€™ve heard good things about hinge as well. It took me using dating apps on and off for about 3 1/2 years before I met him. I had gone on dates and was seeing some people but never anything serious. My advice is donâ€™t date to try and make yourself feel better. You need to be good before you involve yourself with someone else. I chose not to date for 5 years after my injury cause I wasnâ€™t comfortable with myself.,,,,,,,,,,,
3482,I paid for Tinder  this month all I got was spam. Anyone want to help me with my Tinder profile DM me.,,,,,,,,,,,
3483,"If youâ€™re over 30, there are a few subs that will help: r/datingoverthirty, r/datingoverforty, and r/datingprofilesover30 to get feedback on your profile. There are also subs for Bumble and OKCupid (and Tinder but honestly thatâ€™s all guys complaining how they never get matches and giving each other terrible advice.",,,,,,,,,,,
3484,,,,,,,,,,,,
3485,"Itâ€™s pretty normal for guys to get fewer matches than women. Itâ€™s early days so far, so donâ€™t stress too much. Hinge is slower than Tinder, which makes sense because itâ€™s more relationships focused. Iâ€™m a fan of OKC but to be honest itâ€™s also quite slow - I just like that you can have a virtually endless profile. I tend to get fewer but better quality matches there. You should probably know that Match was sued by the FTC for listing fake profiles to make the service seem more popular: https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/09/ftc-sues-owner-online-dating-service-matchcom-using-fake-love",,,,,,,,,,,
3486,"I have had a surprising amount of success, I have a new date today, and it started when I just started being totally honest in my profile and then conversation. I explain what happened, what that means, and what may be different if someone dates me. Sometimes people balk, but that is okay because it would not have worked out. Persistence is key. Also, it's hard but learning bit tot take any of it personally has helped me.",,,,,,,,,,,
3487,Why do you say online dating is your only option?,,,,,,,,,,,
3488,I dated online once for about 8 months and I can tell you this:,,,,,,,,,,,

3490,Now is a bad time to start.,,,,,,,,,,,
3491,,,,,,,,,,,,
3492,"There are two sides, of course, it's painful for me to look back on it, and the details are fuzzy, but I attribute one of the reasons it fizzled out is because we didn't meet together in person once. It's something you don't realize the importance of until you can't have it. It's the little things like kissing, cuddling, holding hands, and sharing moments together instead of relating them over Skype. Sometimes it's emotionally overwhelming. With the pandemic, who knows how long it'll be before you can safely meet them irl.",,,,,,,,,,,
3493,,,,,,,,,,,,
3494,"My advice is don't look for a partner right now; look for a friend. Find someone you can talk to, even better a group. Then when this pandemic is over you can consider a relationship. If it's with your new friend, then you can meet freely without the strain of having no physical contact. If it's someone else, you still have a friend you can rely on.",,,,,,,,,,,
3495,,,,,,,,,,,,
3496,Good luck out there.,,,,,,,,,,,
3497,"I donâ€™t go out much anymore except to restaurants and the movies. I liked hanging out at bars before my accident, but now I donâ€™t feel entirely comfortable going. Not only cause of the wheelchair, but my bladder issues force me to wear a diaper. So all that combined just stresses me out. But also Iâ€™ve never been one to approach and certainly not now. I guess itâ€™s something I need to work on..Anyone feel like a road trip?Today I took a road trip.  I live in California  12 min away from downtown San Francisco.",,,,,,,,,,,

What is a must, is to ensure proper rehab with really strong support staff i.e. involved physiotherapist and occupational therapist.

3546,"1. Ideally every 20 mins a push up for 30 seconds. However I would recommend every 10 minutes, a push-up for 30 seconds. I did for 7-8 yrs, this saves Sci from pressure sores in buttocks, or under thighs. Off late reduced, since I do a lot of household chores. Lying in prone position, if he doesn't change his position every 2hrs.",,,,,,,,,,,
3547,2. Proper intake of fluid at regular intervals.,,,,,,,,,,,
3548,3. Sticking to a regime / schedule. This will help body adjust and settle down later down in life. Speaking from experience. Starting from bowel routine to peeing routine.,,,,,,,,,,,
3549,"4. As a wheelchair user, should build strong upper body strength.",,,,,,,,,,,
3550,"5. Leaks and bowel accidents will happen, if regime is not properly followed, and if they do. He shouldn't beat himself down or feel regret. Sometimes shit happens (literally).",,,,,,,,,,,
3551,"6. Be as a support model and encourager to do things independently and you shouldn't help. However in case you realize he isn't safe, jump in.",,,,,,,,,,,
3552,7. Stay away from stem cell.,,,,,,,,,,,
3553,"8. As a couple, talk to doctor about sex, love, and being a partner and understand how. After SCI, one of the major issues is no erection(in few cases). Should be dealt before its leaves a deep scar. I am not sure, how it would be for his level of injury.",,,,,,,,,,,
3554,9. Take care of yourself emotionally cuz there will be a lot of venting out. Frustration.,,,,,,,,,,,
3555,"10. Get a proper seating cushion. One cannot avoid sores even if proper cushion is used. Which is why pushups. Pushup meaning, lifting the body up, increasing blood flow to lower part of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,

3557,I tried to be comprehensive here. Much info available for me to finish with just 10 ðŸ™‚,,,,,,,,,,,
3558,"1. I went to a rehabilitation center in the country where I live and it was very bad, the physical therapists werent doing their job well and kept looking at the time to move onto the next patient.",,,,,,,,,,,
3559,,,,,,,,,,,,
3560,Then I went to Poland where the physical therapy was very intense as it should be. I was doing PT for around 6 hours a day.,,,,,,,,,,,
3561,,,,,,,,,,,,
3562,He should be doing as much PT as possible for the first 6-24 months as that's when most progress happens.,,,,,,,,,,,
3563,,,,,,,,,,,,
3564,"I stayed at the center in Poland for about 3 months, then went back home and had a PT visit me almost daily for a year and a half for around 3 hours a day to do as much PT as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,

3566,I cant stress this enough but make him do AS MUCH PT  as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,
3567,,,,,,,,,,,,
3568,,,,,,,,,,,,

3576,"Hi there, first off it's completely normal to be a little lost and feel overwhelmed in this situation. The most important part of the process right now is to make sure your boyfriend has a proper support system in place from a medical and family/friend perspective. Sounds like he is being taken care of on both fronts which is a great start to his path to recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,
3577,,,,,,,,,,,,
3578,"One question, did the doctor mention if his injury is complete or incomplete? This distinction is a starting point to begin setting expectations for his path to recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,
3579,,,,,,,,,,,,
3580,"My personal stay at inpatient rehab for an incomplete t4 injury was 1 month. Thankfully I was at a center that specialized in SCI so the level of attention I received was tremendous. In hindsight, I wish I asked for additional time at rehab, the more work, and gains you can make immediately after an injury is only to your benefit. My recommendation would be to take full advantage of what is available to you from an insurance perspective. Work with your PT therapists and doctors to fight for additional time if needed. Also, during his time in rehab it's important he has emotional support - it will be filled with highs and lows. As I went through the emotional roller coaster I was fortunate to have my wife by my",side. S,e was,'t wit,me 24/7 but,oul,s,op b,be,ore,and aft,r work

3675,,,,,,,,,,,,
3676,"Or you can start by exploring your body by yourself, and begin building self-confidence from there. Often with SCI, the areas above our injuries become extra sensitive -- this means that you may be able to derive A LOT of pleasure from having places like your neck and ears stimulated.  I don't know if you are able to touch/stroke these areas with your hands/fingers, but try it if you can. Go slow. Fantasize while you do it.",,,,,,,,,,,

After my SCI, my body completely switched from wanting clit stimulation to G-spot.  Again, I don't know your hand/arm function, but try to explore this if you can.

3694,Is Spasticity consistent or does it vary (Maybe I have an infection?)Usually spasms have some form of consistency to you. Night/morning. If that pattern changes it could be your body telling you something is wrong. Spasms are unique to the individual. For example: I get bad spasms when I sleep all through the night. So I sleep in cannonball / fetal position. One time I got a fever and my spasms were non-stop stabbing me in my stomach until I got better... :/ All and all - just keep a diary or mental note of what your normal spasm regimen is. Anything else â€” then talk to your PCP or PT/OT if you have one.,,,,,,,,,,,

3696,The first movement after some time of inactivity is what triggers my spasms. The longer the better. For example my spasms in the morning when I wake up are strong.

3713,"Other than that...I tend to not want to kink shame.  Consenting adults, and all that.  However, I have had quite a few interactions with devotees that have not been fully consensual/upfront, and that pisses me off, and tends to make me see the group as a whole as people who are creepy and not to be trusted.  Let me give a couple examples.",,,,,,,,,,,

They'll leave comments on my videos like, â€�Could you show a transfer?â€� or â€�I'm curious about how you put shoes on, could you demonstrate?â€� like it's just their innocent curiosity (and also like I'm a fucking idiot).  I don't appreciate this gross duplicity.",,,,,,,,,,,
3716,,,,,,,,,,,,
3717,"I have also had men message me on Reddit.  At first they'll act like they're trying to get all woke and progressive and learn about my disability.  The questions start innocent enough, and I'll think, OK, people need to learn, I'll try and educate this person.  Then the questions get more and more personal and detailed and graphic...and at a certain point I sigh, realizing that once again this has nothing to do with a kindhearted person wanting to see me as more human -- in fact, it's just the opposite.",,,,,,,,,,,

3719,"So, in conclusion, I'm over devotees because of the lying, the deceit, the creepiness, and how they fake being disabled in order to get their jollies.

3725,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just received a message from a devotee on one of my social media accounts and it made me realize that this practice of fetishizing someone's disability is wrong on so many levels. It can't be compared to other kinks. By being okay with it, I'd be encouraging the idea that your disability defines everything you are. The idea that you're helpless because of it.

3738,"if you mean stiffness around your joints, ie you're losing range of motion, that's a different kind of stiffness due to loss of length in your muscles around the joint. This is common when you aren't walking because you can't move your joints (hips, knees, ankles) through their full range of motion. It can also be caused by bony changes in your joints - heterotopic ossification is not uncommon with SCI and it causes bony overgrowth usually in your hips that can cause that joint to become stuck in a particular position.

He might also find the SCI Owner's Club group on Facebook helpful - it's not open to family and carers so he would have to join himself if that appeals, but it's a great way to talk to other spinal cord injured people about their lived experiences, which is so different from the advice you get from hospital.

You can also get grants for home conversion - you'll probably want an occupational therapist to assess your dad, but I'm sure they would have provision for that at Salisbury. It's a big job but it's worth it, and there is support out there, it just takes a bit of time and effort to sort through it all.

3883,When I was discharged in 2004 in Wales they would not let me leave until suitable living area was available.

3923,I'm only a Para (t8 complete) but I have a handful and I've shot a decent amount after my injury. My upper body isn't in bad shape so u can handle recoil and even a stiff trigger but reaching my arms out to aim makes me fall forward. If I shoot with only one hand I can brace my other on my knees but that makes me a bit shaky. I can scoot myself farther forward in the chair to lean back more but that feels awkward as well.

3950,,,,,,,,,,,,
3951,"Every situation is obviously unique but I would suggest for you to swap the cane for walking sticks. Like you my right leg was much weaker than my left for whatever reason, and the ankle always dragged. With a cane (not sure if you're still using it) I found myself favoring one leg over the other, with sticks it forces you to use both legs equally and it's much better for balance. I also got rid of the AFO early on. I did not want my ankle to be reliant on it and train it to stop dragging. It took time but it's feeling much better now.",,,,,,,,,,,
3952,"Thanks for sharing your wisdom. Completely agree with your statement that life can be amazing but only if you take charge -- cheers brotherThanks for sharing, although each injury is unique it seems like we went through similar situations.

3954,Inside the house I'll walk around without any assistance but still drag my ankle around - its not entirely stable. When I leave the house I'll wear my AFO as I can move faster and it provides some stability.Hoping to gain some knowledge and insight for a potential tv show about a girl with an SCII like what youâ€™re doing and I support it. Is there a reason you chose L1-L5? In my opinion itâ€™s better to have a higher injury maybe T2-C7/8? The most frustrating thing I encounter as a C5/6 is that people think everyone in a chair is the same. Itâ€™s either waist down or total paralysis like Christopher Reeves. It would be beneficial to show someone in between to educate that itâ€™s a spectrum.,,,,,,,,,,,
3955,,,,,,,,,,,,
3956,Hardest 3 things in my opinion are all social. I am a male and and was very athletic/active so thatâ€™s much different though.,,,,,,,,,,,
3957,"1) Relationships. A active person who experiences an SCI instantly becomes incompatible with their friends and lovers. Finding normal people to share experiences becomes very hard. As a guy, being in a chair comes with a lot of feelings of emasculation. I canâ€™t speak for women but I would expect similar feelings of inadequacies. Online dating (speaking as a guy) is very difficult.",,,,,,,,,,,
3958,2) Inability to travel internationally.,,,,,,,,,,,
3959,"3) finding a place to live, even in the US. Moving and finding an apartment or home is such a monumental pain in the ass. Is the entrance barrier free? Is the bathroom big enough? Are all doors wide enough? Etc.",,,,,,,,,,,
3960,,,,,,,,,,,,
3961,"The biggest annoyance I always see in TV/movies is that someone experiences a SCI then, with a lot of hard work, they are able to overcome and be normal again. Culture and the general population picks up on this and projects this expectation to those of us who have an SCI. 99% of people will never again stand/walk move anything below their level of injury. Having to come to terms with something permanent, regardless of any amount of money or hard work, is a struggle we all live with.",,,,,,,,,,,
3962,,,,,,,,,,,,
3963,I also donâ€™t like the traditional expectation that people who experience an SCI must automatically be an inspirational speaker. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that but thereâ€™s plenty of â€œregularâ€� jobs we can do and some are held in very high esteem. Weâ€™re all still regular people and we prefer to be treated as such.,,,,,,,,,,,

3980,"-the first few days home from the hospital were a nightmare. Learning to walk, eat, dress myself, etc again in a completely accessible environment was one thing. But at home where the hallways are smaller, toilets are lower, and beds arenâ€™t mechanical...it was a total shock.

The outpatient clinic I went to for therapy also had a driving rehab clinic that was run by an OT who was also a certified driving instructor. The clinic owned some vehicles with various types of hand controls just like a driver's Ed school would own some cars.

4154,"Not sure if we are talking about the same thing, but here is a copy-paste of what I wrote regarding a Mitrofanoff procedure in an older post:",,,,,,,,,,,
4155,,,,,,,,,,,,
4156,I've had mine for about a year. I am a C5 with very limited hand function. My mitrofanoff exits in the navel. As far as I know it depends on your preference and the actual length of your appendix (or substitute).,,,,,,,,,,,
4157,,,,,,,,,,,,
4158,Due to a spastic sphincter muscle leading to my bladder normal cathing was very problematic (several urologists struggled for 20-30 minutes sometimes) I used a supra pubis for a long time. After a year or so I started having problems with bladder stones and bacterial colonization. While I did not experience any UTI symptoms the detritus from the bacteria were so numerous that the whole tube could be clogged by them. In addition the cath openings would get clogged by calcareous deposits. Even when I ate/medicated to keep the pH levels good a size 14 would only last for about 10 days before I had to change it. Needless to say this became very tiresome.,,,,,,,,,,,
4159,,,,,,,,,,,,
4160,"My experience with the mitrofanoff is very positive. I can usually hold 400-500 ml, though I usually keep to a routine of cathing every 3-4 hours (I've been recommended to not surpass 400 ml as a general rule). I usually produce more in the evening than the morning, so I guess you should just cath more often first until you learn how your body operates. I can feel a tingling sensation in my neck when the capacity is stretched, and sometimes if I chug a lot of liquid I might feel it before I usually would. I think the more rapid expansion of the bladder might trigger this.",,,,,,,,,,,
4161,,,,,,,,,,,,
4162,"As mentioned I have very poor hand control, so my assistants do the procedure, but it only takes 4-5 minutes and the whole procedure is very easy once learned. I have only had slight symptoms of UTIs after getting the mitrofanoff and they never developed further. A big bonus when I no longer need a bag is to be able to wear shorts in the summer etc. If I am going to a party or similar i simply attach a bag to a cath and don't need to worry about capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,
4163,,,,,,,,,,,,
4164,I do take botox injections in my bladder every 3 months to keep my spastic bladder under control. During those procedures it has been confirmed that I do not have any bladder stones so far (they removed 15+ before the mitrofanoff procedure.,,,,,,,,,,,
4165,,,,,,,,,,,,
4166,"The main (only? ) negative was the post op period. I usually feel absolutely fine after surgeries, and this was the case the first two days. I was up in my electric chair and visiting my post accidental ward chatting about. From the third day however I started vomiting gall and generally felt... terrible. it's actually hard to remember exactly what I felt but as I worsened over the next few days I have never in my life felt as bad as that. After a while it was discovered that the cause was an elius/twisted intestine (a risk with all similar operations), and I was re-operated 5 or 6 days after the first operation. It took maybe 2 more days before the clog was sorted, and I have never been more relieved. I lost",bout 20,lbs a,d have,only now reac,ed,y,re o,we,ght,Maybe,hey di
4167,,,,,,,,,,,,
4168,Edit: I was slightly distraught with the functionality at first. After about a month of letting everything heal the first attempts were very difficult when trying to get the cath in. After a while this sorted itself and is not a problem at all anymore. The capacity could also be as little as 50-100 ml in the beginning before I would start sensing the tingling (which will be followed by headaches or leakage after a while). This also got better as the bladder got used to being filled again (supra pubis = tiny bladder).,,,,,,,,,,,
4169,,,,,,,,,,,,
4170,TL;DR: Very happy with mine in combination with botox bladder treatment + beware of symptoms of elius a few days post op. I wish you good luck and I think you will be happy with the results!,,,,,,,,,,,
4171,Anyone have both the Aus and the pump?,,,,,,,,,,,
4172,"That sucks. You would really think there would be a robotic solution to something as simple as a sphincter by nowI also have a Mitrofanoff (~15 years) but the opening has become obstructed by scar tissue and I intermittent cath, so everytime I have to urinate, it takes longer and longer and becoming more and more painful (5+ minutes).",,,,,,,,,,,

It sounds like your problem might be the stool is too loose and a bulking agent might do the work to shore it up so you have less accidents? Or, maybe you should switch out to suppositories? I use nonstimulant suppositories, bit of digistim and sometimes fybrogel (a bulking agent) and haven't had any problems - just because Peristeen works to soften the stool, so maybe you might need something to start your process like the stimulant suppository but not necessarily soften to the same extent?",,,,,,,,,,,

4411,Drink Plenty of Fluids,,,,,,,,,,,
4412,,,,,,,,,,,,
4413,"Drinking plenty of liquids can decrease the risk of UTIs by making you pee more, which helps remove bacteria from the urinary tract.",,,,,,,,,,,
4414,,,,,,,,,,,,
4415,Increase Vitamin C Intake,,,,,,,,,,,
4416,,,,,,,,,,,,
4417,"Increasing vitamin C intake may decrease the risk of UTIs by making the urine more acidic, thus killing off infection-causing bacteria.",,,,,,,,,,,

4419,Drink Unsweetened Cranberry Juice,,,,,,,,,,,
4420,,,,,,,,,,,,
4421,Some studies show that cranberries could help reduce the risk of urinary tract infections by preventing bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract.,,,,,,,,,,,
4422,,,,,,,,,,,,
4423,Take a Probiotic,,,,,,,,,,,
4424,,,,,,,,,,,,

4426,,,,,,,,,,,,
4427,Try These Natural Supplements (check with your physician or pharmacist regarding any negative reactions of supplements with your prescription medications.),,,,,,,,,,,
4428,,,,,,,,,,,,
4429,Here are a few supplements that have been studied:,,,,,,,,,,,
4430,,,,,,,,,,,,
4431,D-Mannose: This is a type of sugar that is found in cranberries and has been shown to be effective in treating UTIs and preventing recurrence.,,,,,,,,,,,
4432,,,,,,,,,,,,
4433,"Bearberry leaf: Also known as uva-ursi. One study showed that a combination of bearberry leaf, dandelion root and dandelion leaf decreased UTI recurrence.",,,,,,,,,,,

4436,,,,,,,,,,,,
4437,Garlic extract: Garlic has been shown to have antimicrobial properties and may be able to block the growth of bacteria to prevent UTIs,,,,,,,,,,,
4438,"It might seem weird but cranberry pills are actually what urologists recommend to prevent UTIs. Vitamin C can also help. If you catheterise, it is important that you have clean hands and a sterile working environment.",,,,,,,,,,,

4441,I've been on 50mg nitrofurantoin at bedtime for roughly 8 years. I know an antibiotic everyday isn't great but it's been working really well for me.,,,,,,,,,,,
4442,Donâ€™t eat as much sugar and take a gulp of apple cider vinegar,,,,,,,,,,,
4443,"Honestly the best thing you can do is drink, drink, and drink water. Staying hydrated helps flush out bacteria that gets into the bladder and urinate tract. I also take the Mannose pills. I believe that it helps. Iâ€™ll link what I take below. They are pretty cheap. I take three at once during the day. The next thing is your cath method. Can you provide more info? Are you a male or female? What type of catheter are you using? Might be able to offer more suggestions with that info.

I think that the issue I have is that even a very mild UTI causes bladder spasms in me, and the botox helps fight the spasms. I used to get tested and go on antibiotics 6-10 years a year before botox.... I've been tested for UTIs twice in the last 3 years. Once when I had a decently bad one, and once when my botox was wearing off.  All tests the second time came back negative, but I had many of the signs of a UTI, including leaking as frequently as every 15 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,
4450,"Ask your urologist about going on a bladder flushing regime. You do low dose oral antibiotics most of the time, flush your bladder with plain saline every night.

Might try getting off them in a few months or something. Hope you get it figured out.,,,,,,,,,,,

4461,I have never had a regular catheter as my entire urethra was destroyed during my accident. What I can tell you from having a suprapubic catheter for over a year now is that it has been a rollercoaster of learning.

Because up until recently we kept using the wrong kind of catheter for me (everyone's body reacts differently) it used to be very very painful when they would remove one to insert another. Now it is painless and no big deal at all. Most of the time I can't tell that I even have a catheter other than sometimes when I move my drain bag I can feel the pressure in the line go up and down.

Try hard not to build an expectation that you'll do stuff for your mother just because you're there and it's easier. Work with your stepdad, and whatever outside help you have available, to impress upon your mother just how important it is for her to maintain and assert her independence.

Donâ€™t let it stop you! Community college is a great option to for people who did not do so great in high school and may even do better in college than they did in HS,,,,,,,,,,,
4839,"I think community college makes sense if you can transfer credits, you also save money. Get a few classes out of the way, work out any issues, and transfer after the first year or semester. You need to check with colleges in advance about accepting credit transfers. There's usually space available after people drop out, but you miss out on some of the freshman socializing. It gives you a chance to ease into college level work without stress of getting your basic sci stuff setup/taken care of in a dorm room. It can really depend on which college, because you want to go somewhere where you have the right accomodations and accessibility.",,,,,,,,,,,

4841,"I went straight to college after graduating, but took almost two year off during high school after my sci. My grades were very good.

All of that stuff you see on internet, what your counselors say,  and probably classmates say is a lot of hearsay and kinda misleading. You can totally get in with a poor GPA, mostly because I've done it. Just once you apply it will probably flag you application and say you will need to write an essay explaining your situation, how you've changed, and how what happened in HS won't happen again. All you have to do is answer the questions BUT, and this is important, you should have an open line of communication with admissions and the office of disability services explaining the situation.

They talk about things related to the injury or just regular things like what shows are really good at the moment. Itâ€™s a really good community.,,,,,,,,,,,
4926,"It depends - each injury, even with the same mechanism, in the same pattern and level, has different outcomes. Some loss of mobility, sensation and function ( below the injury level - bowel, bladder, etc) is likely to happen and can be permanent. An incomplete injury means thereâ€™s more potential for recovery but it is rarely complete recovery. Active rehab is key! She will find out more as her primary injury heals and she is tested in rehab and gets more into physio therapy and OT what her rehab overhaul could look like.",,,,,,,,,,,
4927,,,,,,,,,,,,
4928,"Best of luck, itâ€™s a tough time - just give her the space to work on her recovery with no expectations - be her cheering squad, not her drill sargeant. Itâ€™s common for people who get some recovery to feel guilty or like they are expected to be â€œback to normalâ€� after rehab when they still have lasting permanent issues like pain or spasticity or bladder dysfunction... so try to be that person who just wants to support her recovery, no matter what it looks like.",,,,,,,,,,,

4931,"Anything is possible with an incomplete injury. Iâ€™m a T12/L1 incomplete for over 3 years now and I can only walk about 300 feet with braces and a walker with help. There are other people with higher injuries that can walk alright. It all depends on the extent of the damage done to her spinal cord. Inpatient rehab helped me tremendously, but I was in really bad shape and stayed in inpatient for 4 months. I still do outpatient PT twice a week and that is really necessary for recovering. I truly hope for a good outcome for your sister.",,,,,,,,,,,
4932,T11 incomplete everyone is different and everybody reacts different to therapy and speed. How long sheâ€™s In therapy depends on insurance her needs and doctors evaluation on  progress. PT and OT will work on your goals. I Highly recommend that sheâ€™s stay inpatient and donâ€™t rush home for therapy. I did that and regretted it every second as it took way more to get into another therapy and Iâ€™m not getting good therapy at that.  As for her walking again only time well tell.

4934,,,,,,,,,,,,

4953,"A lot of good suggestions so far! I would also like to add talking with your therapists about grabbing you for additional therapy if they have time. Sometimes schedules get changed last minute or patients refuse therapy, and if thatâ€™s the case if they know youâ€™re down for some extra time they can come get you. This is especially helpful on the weekends when the downtime is the most boring. You can also ask if thereâ€™s some exercises to do in your room and the therapy teams can give you some small equipment to use in the room. I would also ask if thereâ€™s any recreational therapy available, sometimes they have some crafts or other fun things to do!",,,,,,,,,,,

5077,"A couple things caught my eye, though.  You speak of getting vitamin D from sunlight (which is fine) and from foods.  From what I read, sunlight can easily produce enough vitamin D to maintain your immune system.  The caveat is that you may have to spend a fair amount of time with exposed skin in the sun -- and production of vitamin D is inversely related to the darkness of your skin (as well as the amount of skin you cover with clothing).",,,,,,,,,,,

5079,"OTOH, foods may not be a  reliable source of vitamin D for two reasons:  They don't necessarily contain very much vitamin D, and they may contain vitamin D2 which is somewhat toxic in high doses.  (If I understand it right, you'd have to go to some trouble to poison yourself with vitamin D2 from foods, just because they don't contain all that much.)

Foods have less Vitamin D but, digesting them in distributed manner is more effective than all in one go. It is difficult to calculate absorption rates.. e.g. Magnesium Tablets vs Ionic - Ionic absorbs better. Food, even slower absorption probably, but more efficient for quantities. Out of the D3 2000 IU, not all will be absorbed. If I had a fillet of Salmon, it lasts about 3 hours for me and I can really feel the effects greater than the tablets depending on how it was cooked.. maybe because of the fat and combined components.

5248,"my city has a walkway down over the sand and they have beach chairs for rent (for free, they hold my ID to make sure I bring it back). I always go with my friends and they push me, because there arenâ€™t motorized ones available. we just bring the normal stuff- swimsuits, towels, sunglasses, sunscreen, snacks and drinks. I always bring an extra towel to put over my legs during the sunniest part of the day (if we donâ€™t go to one of the restaurants or bars across the street) because sunburns can cause AD. I also always bring crocs or water shoes, crocs stay on my feet better and water shoes protect my feet from scrapes if I get in the water.",,,,,,,,,,,

5268,,,,,,,,,,,,
5269,My therapist told me to continue to irritate any new feeling if sensation. The nerves are hyperactive and increased activity will allow for eventual increase in sensation with normalized feeling.

I can feel pain, pressure and sometimes temperature. Temp just started recently and is patchy. When I was in rehab I could just barely move my one big toe. As of now I can move 5 toes on my left foot and can wiggle my foot a little. Itâ€™s definitely possible to be getting return years out. Have you thought about acupuncture?

5305,,,,,,,,,,,,
5306,Cons: Biggest risk I've seen is failure over time in that it slowly just stops helping. Obviously with any implanted device risk of infections/bleeding/etc.  Others include lead breakage/migration.,,,,,,,,,,,

I think collagen is a protein so I can see how it could be helpful, but I havenâ€™t tried.",,,,,,,,,,,
5341,"Chemist here.  Collagen is protein, but contains a the *imino* acids called ""proline"" and ""hydroxyproline.""  (These are essentially cyclic *amino* acid, but you really don't need to understand even that much.)  There are 20 essential amino acids -- ones that cannot be synthesized in our bodies -- but these two imino acids are not among those 20.  Hence, there is no absolute dietary requirement for these.",,,,,,,,,,,
5342,,,,,,,,,,,,
5343,"However, it seems that when you eat proteins high in these imino acids, they benefit connective tissue in your body -- including hair and nails.  Your body does not need to convert another amino acid (glutamic acid, I believe it would be) into these imino acids.",,,,,,,,,,,

5350,ARA 290?Preface: I'm a medical researcher involved in clinical trials. I'd never heard of this agent. My initial thoughts:,,,,,,,,,,,
5351,,,,,,,,,,,,
5352,"1. [ARA290](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cibinetide), also known as Cibinetide, also known as pyroglutamate helix B surface peptide (PHBSP), is a patented agent.",,,,,,,,,,,
5353,"2. The publication you posted is from a [registered clinical trial (RCT)](https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2010-021518-45) that was started in 2010. The initial pilot results are published in 2014. And now here we are in 2020 and there have only been [3 RCT](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=ARA290&type=&rslt=&age_v=&gndr=&intr=&titles=&outc=&spons=&lead=&id=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&locn=&rsub=&strd_s=&strd_e=&prcd_s=&prcd_e=&sfpd_s=&sfpd_e=&rfpd_s=&rfpd_e=&lupd_s=&lupd_e=&sort=) listed on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov). Basically this mean it hasn't ""caught on"". *This does not mean it doesn't work*. But there's some reason it hasn't caught on.",,,,,,,,,,,
5354,"3. A [NLM search for the agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&term=%22cibinetide%22%5BNM%5D) shows that in pre-clinical trials (e.g., animal experiments) it's being tested on non-specific disease models. Kidney disease, skin wounds, optic nerves. This isn't bad, but it raises the ""*throw shit on the wall and see what sticks*"" red flag. This is because most of the time a pharmacological agent has a specific target, e.g., it talks to a receptor that exists on a specific tissue (e.g., neurons, or renal cells, or skin cells) that is involved in a disease.",,,,,,,,,,,

5385,"There's a couple of aspects here. Can't speak to physical therapy, hopefully someone else pipes up from their profession. You could very likely find a rewarding career as a PA where your possible limitations aren't an issue (psych comes to mind). However, it's getting through school that presents some serious barriers. The good news is that schools tend to go pretty far, working with folks who need accommodations, they tend to be pretty good about that sort of thing. At the same time, standards and requirements are important and there's only so far accommodations can get you. Frankly this seems quite specific and particular to you and may depend on additional details.",,,,,,,,,,,

5387,"Surgery rotations in particular come to mind as something that could be quite difficult. Standing for extended periods of time without moving while holding traction, as well as suturing/tying can be physically demanding and require fine motor skill. With experimentation, you may find certain techniques are less problematic (one-hand tie for example). That said, there are often a range of possible rotation sites and preceptors, and one may be available with foresight and planning that could be more accommodating. I would honestly recommend contacting a school close to you with specific questions.",,,,,,,,,,,

It seems strange that it would help me throughout my body but cause new symptoms on or in my head.r/DisabilityArtTrach left in too longIs he breathing on his own? No mechanical ventilation? That is the important first step. He has to be weaned off of mechanical ventilation. I do not know where is injury was, but some people can be off a ventilator (mechanical ventilation) for periods of time, and then go back on.

5391,"Sometimes people donâ€™t need assistance breathing (ie: ventilator), but they need a trach the be able to take adequate breaths on their own. Is the trach capped and has it been for a while with no issues? If so, I think itâ€™s reasonable to ask if his medical team about decannulation. If not, they are likely focused on other aspects of his recovery and rehabilitation right now and he still needs the trach.",,,,,,,,,,,
5392,,,,,,,,,,,,
5393,"FYI, the typical progression from having an open trach is first use of a Passey-Muir valve, sometimes called a speaking valve. This still allows air in, but all exhales occur more naturally and allow a person to speak. Then usually they will trial capping. Then, if the person is able to tolerate being capped (basically, the trach is not in use) for extended time without adverse effects they will consider removing the trach. The above sequence is done under supervision/guidance of either a physician or speech and language pathologist. Not everyone ends up getting the trach removed and may plateau at any point and the time it takes to progress to each level is highly dependent on the personâ€™s individual factor",.,,,,,,,,,,
5394,,,,,,,,,,,,
5395,I think itâ€™s wonderful you are looking to advocate for your family member. Definitely ask questions to the medical professionals that are working with him. They will know his specific circumstances best. Hope this helps.,,,,,,,,,,,
5396,"Find out the injury level and prognosis. Ask about the speaking valve. Be persistent. They left mine in for a week or so too long despite my concerns, only through persistence was it removed",,,,,,,,,,,
5397,"My fiancÃ©e had his trach in for over a year after his initial accident. He had the intubation tube down his throat for twice as long as youâ€™re supposed to, due to complications, so a lot of scar tissue had developed in his throat. They had to do different procedures to try and remove the scar tissue so that his throat was open above the trach, and after being tired of hearing the â€œwait and see how this one goesâ€� we got a second opinion, and less than 4 months later the trach was out.",,,,,,,,,,,
5398,,,,,,,,,,,,
5399,"Itâ€™s my understanding that as long as heâ€™s still using a vent in any capacity, theyâ€™ll leave the trach in. If he has any other respiratory issues, or if scar tissue has developed, it most likely wonâ€™t be as simple as taking it out. Heâ€™ll also have to pass a swallow test and see a speech therapist before theyâ€™ll remove it, from our experience.",,,,,,,,,,,
5400,May I ask what level his injury is at?,,,,,,,,,,,
5401,"As someone who has been in exactly your uncle's position I can say that it is a very difficult situation. Having the ability to use your speech is in itself a major improvement on your life opportunities. I was on one for four months, but I was eventually able to recover. Again, this depends on everyone and might take much longer for your uncle depending on the severity.",,,,,,,,,,,
5402,,,,,,,,,,,,
5403,I would strongly recommend speaking to his neurologist/neurosurgeon and pulmonologist. Get whomever who can talk about it to help you.,,,,,,,,,,,
5404,,,,,,,,,,,,
5405,"Some things to let you know. Depending on the level it may take longer to get off the trach and please keep that in mind. Second, when you have a trach depending on the severity of the respiratory health you can have it adjusted so as to allow air to move upward to the mouth so as to allow speech. Third, do you know that they are avoiding it â€“ as in have you spoken to them or anyone you know? Often, the decision is also very difficult for doctors. Fourth, what is his level of mobility with his arm â€“ is it limited or can he use his arm to function like normal in which case you can begin exploring using technology to bridge the gap temporarily. That will also give a headstart later in life to explore other i",depende,ce me,hanism,.,,,,,,,
5406,"I had to use a ventilator for several weeks after my injury due to complications from my spinal fusion. Even when I was able to breathe well enough on my own, the doctors left the trach in for a few months to get through flu season. They didnâ€™t want to have to intubate me or do another trach if things got bad. Considering everything going on with the coronavirus, maybe this could be what theyâ€™re thinking?",,,,,,,,,,,
5407,"I'll add my weight for advocacy about Passy-Muir valve use during the day. If your uncle is still requiring ventilator support overnight, then there'll be no question of the trach coming out until that support is no longer required, but it's worth pushing the discussion in that direction. My daughter was weaned off her vent over the course of a couple of weeks (her SCI is lower, at T9, but she also suffered traumatic injuries to diaphragm and lungs) having been ventilated for more than two months. The Passy-Muir was a huge psychological boost - being able to speak was definitely a part of that, but the milestones around the various SLP evaluations and swallow tests were important too.",,,,,,,,,,,
5408,"We (wife and I) were kept informed - in fact were actively encouraged to participate in and contribute to both the daily care briefings in ICU and, later, the weekly complex continuing care conference - I'd also echo the suggestion from u/billrn1999 to encourage your parents to make sure they're part of these discussions too. Keep asking questions - I'd be surprised, and somewhat disappointed, if a direct question doesn't receive a sensible answer. And if that answer is ""wait and see"" then ask ""why? Wait for what, see what?""",,,,,,,,,,,
5409,"It's a scary and frustrating time for everyone, and it's potentially more damaging to decanulate too early and then have to go in again if he requires breathing support in future. Be bold in your advocacy, but try not to get too upset when the answers aren't what you wanted to hear.",,,,,,,,,,,
5410,This isn't with regard to the trach but is your family member  making use of text to speech apps for communication?,,,,,,,,,,,
5411,"Heâ€™s on a vent at night. Itâ€™s hard because my parents are the ones doing most of the communication with the doctors but Iâ€™ll try to be more adamant about them taking more interest in it. Thank you for your responseThank you!Got it. I guess more patience is needed. I just feel so bad for him and I know he spends a lot of energy saying things twice and three times until we can read his lips correctly. Thanks for your responseNot entirely sure how to describe it.

Personally, creatine helped considerably with orthostatic hypotension (I need an abdominal binder to stand without creatine; with it, I feel fine), strength, and endurance. Also like it for brain thinkin'. It does, however, reliably produce a side effect for me. My bladder spasms at lower than usual volumes, and I have less time to get to the bathroom. Over time I have developed a tolerance, & take about 1.5g a day without huge affect to my bladder. If I take a larger dose for any reason, I have issues.

5592,"1. Catheters can be reused. Yes, seriously. After use give it a good rinse with hot water inside and out, and then store it in a bottle of rubbing alcohol. Shake it off before you use it next time. I've used a single catheter for months on end without a single UTI.",,,,,,,,,,,
5593,"2. Meds: talk to your primary doctor now. If you get UTIs frequently, ask for an Rx for antibiotics to keep on hand. Get 90 day supplies of meds. I'm a primary care physician and have already done this for all of my SCI patients.",,,,,,,,,,,
5594,Itâ€™s been on my mind for sure. I order 90 days worth of catheters at a time and donâ€™t reuse but if it came to it you CAN reuse catheters as long as you are extra careful (thereâ€™s some good YouTube videos that show how to clean/sterilize them). I did it for years when I couldnâ€™t afford to buy them fresh. Itâ€™s stressful for sure! Hang in there.,,,,,,,,,,,

So your blood could pool down to your lower body, i.e. leave your brain, causing you to get lightheaded and possibly pass out.  Wearing an abdominal binder could help mitigate this.  You should start small with the standing frame, only ten minutes or so the first few days then increasing ten minutes every few days after that.

I bought the Hitachi Magic Wand and the first time I used it, I prob orgasmed within 15 seconds, no joke, despite not having any sensation down there (I guess it had been a while, lol).

6099,"Two other things that have dramatically improved my sex life: (1) using penile injections (Tri-Mix or EDEX) instead of oral pills (e.g. Viagra, Cialis), especially for a complete SCI para like me (no sensation).

6180,,,,,,,,,,,,
6181,The methods:,,,,,,,,,,,
6182,- wash in soap and water,,,,,,,,,,,
6183,- Put it in a bowl and pour literally boiling water over it,,,,,,,,,,,
6184,- use iso alcohol but rinse thoroughly to avoid irritation,,,,,,,,,,,

6193,Eventually I was so lost that I called the spinal injury support center and asked for a nurse to home visit. Without me going on for days she told me this.

6201,"You take the cath out of the tube, use it. Rinse well, stick it back in the tube.",,,,,,,,,,,

6215,It does this amazingly by physically removing them by wiping away! I donâ€™t know if everybody knew this but I really didnâ€™t. I thought you had to â€œkill bacteriaâ€� with anti bacterial agents or a harsh chemicals or something.,,,,,,,,,,,

6465,"ETA: You mentioned that those youâ€™ve spoken to about it havenâ€™t been able to be as supportive as youâ€™d like. I think that likely has less to with whether they care or not and more to do with them not knowing exactly what you need to feel supported. It might silly at first, but sometimes explaining what they can do to support you can be all it takes. Just as this is is uncharted territory for you, the same can be said for them. In my experience, most people donâ€™t necessarily know how to support someone through such a life-altering event, and at times that can come across as uncaring when really itâ€™s just a lack of knowledge (and often a fear of saying or doing the wrong thing).

Without the research, it would be very difficult to justify purchase to an external payor source.  The situations in which I have heard them being paid for, were when the caregiver physically needed assistance for turning the user... that is, the caregiver needed an extra bit of help that a top sheet wouldnâ€™t be able to provide.",,,,,,,,,,,

6712,What's your injury level/presentation like? Have you done much camping post injury?,,,,,,,,,,,
6713,"I used to be a huge backpacker, hiker, camping all sorts of outdoors stuff but unfortunately im a t8 complete para. So I have no way to walk and I've yet to find a way to take a wheelchair on a trail or find a way to camp without an rv or something.",,,,,,,,,,,
6714,"Not exactly camping, but we did some bush walk trails recently with my partner who's a T4 complete para. That was a challenge! Came across some stairs and he was game enough to want to wheelbarrow his way up the stairs - as in get out of the chair and climb up facing down using his hands while I held his legs!",,,,,,,,,,,
6715,"This is what I miss the most. Backpacking, hiking, and camping. It's amazing that accessible trails and campsites exist, but they are too manicured for my liking. Being out in nature and confined to a neatly paved trail makes the experience worse for me. Plus all the equipment and supplies needed for me to camp somewhere is ridiculous. The hassle is not worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,
6716,,,,,,,,,,,,
6717,Take an extra breath of fresh air for both of us next time you're out there.,,,,,,,,,,,
6718,"I want to go camping so bad, I havenâ€™t been since I could walk (Iâ€™m 4 years out). My problem rn is that I live in Florida and Iâ€™m in college, so my only free time to go is summer and it gets way too hot for camping. Iâ€™m also a little nervous about my bowel program when I go but I havenâ€™t put much thought into planning a trip yet.",,,,,,,,,,,
6719,"I'm an SCI walker, no chair. My tumor was removed between T11 and L1. Two years later I had to have an AV Spinal Fistula repaired. Took me 2 years to get away from a walker and a cane. That was back in 2006. I've been doing this type of camping for the last 4 years. I've camped all my life. You can go see what I do and how I walk over at Half Pace Outdoors on YouTube. I do a lot of camping lolHey go check this girls channel out she has some useful info for people in a wheel chair! She can probably help you more than I could.",,,,,,,,,,,

6722,"Luckily my important friends stayed around after my fall. Iâ€™m not very social, but get just enough to not feel totally isolated. Thereâ€™s something about old friends that livens up your soul.",,,,,,,,,,,
6723,,,,,,,,,,,,
6724,"May not be relatable to your situation, but is there an old best friend you can reach out to? Someone you may believe is gone forever, but you guys had shared times together that you still think about? They may be closer than you think and wonder how youâ€™re doing. Sometimes a call or text is all it takes.",,,,,,,,,,,
6725,,,,,,,,,,,,
6726,"Good luck, man. 30 years is beyond respectable living like this.",,,,,,,,,,,
6727,"I am a T-6 Para x 29 years and managed to stay 100% independent while raising a family and holding down a career. It is hard to be social with SCI, because we are treated differently and the injury aftermath shapes our personality into a different being ( who has time for socializing when you are constantly in survival mode?). But your mental health is at stake.",,,,,,,,,,,
6728,What I recommend is that you get involved with Adaptive Sports such as hand cycling. It can be a very social experience and many communities have organized cycling groups and events. Also basketball and rugby and snow skiing. Even ATV off-roading clubs. Find your nearest Adaptive Sports chapter and reach out. Your health and wellness is also a huge side benefit!,,,,,,,,,,,

6732,Hi there.,,,,,,,,,,,
6733,,,,,,,,,,,,
6734,Your post brings a tear to my eye. My boyfriend is a T10 Incomplete and uses a manual chair. Him and I have been together for three years. He wasnâ€™t initially in a chair when I met him. Had a blood clot on his spine due to Mrsa. ANYWAYS. He is the most handsome man I have ever seen even in the chair. I donâ€™t notice it. Other people might but who gives a damn. You shouldnâ€™t let your fear of people only seeing your chair hold you back. This injury has been horrible but the one thing I can say is it really shows you whoâ€™s with you and whoâ€™s not.,,,,,,,,,,,
6735,,,,,,,,,,,,
6736,Cheers.,,,,,,,,,,,

6738,"Hey, I am positive you will meet someone if you didn't just yet... My biyfriend is T6-T10 complete and I knew him way before his accident and after 6 years being by his side and he being by my side, we finally realised that there is something more than friendship. The chair is just a piece of equipment and it is overseen by a lot of people we know. :) So don't be afraid to speak to women, use dating apps, maybe call some old friends that might be more than happy to see you. :) You never know what might happen when you reach out. :)",,,,,,,,,,,
6739,"Hi Weaver, I came across your post and I wanted to share with you. There are many other places you can go besides a bar and definitely meet new people. Check out your community resources in your town. See if they have some sort of a website and it should have local activities. Many places host free events/classes. Also check your local senior center. You may not be old enough to join but they might have information to help you as well or at least point you in the right direction. Use Google to find recreation centers near you. If you don't mind sharing your city I wouldn't mind doing a quick search to see if I can find something.

6743,Great tip. Any recommended stretches?,,,,,,,,,,,
6744,Iâ€™ve just started really stretching beyond my PT stretches- similar to how I would have done sitting stretches pre-paraplegia- and it has been a game changer.

6752,"The main thing to check discoloring is if it blanches. If you press on the color (usually red) it should turn white when you lift up then immediately back to red. If itâ€™s consistently white and leathery, I would imagine itâ€™s scar tissue from previous wounds. But itâ€™s nothing to mess with either way, get it checked immediately if youâ€™re concerned.",,,,,,,,,,,
6753,,,,,,,,,,,,
6754,"I had a stage 4 right above my crack after getting out of the hospital. Iâ€™m sure you know, but weekly debriding at the wound clinic, and daily nurse visits to change bandages, is something you definitely want to avoid. Took 7 months to heal mine, but the remaining tissue is still leathery and discolored. Lighter than the surrounding tissue. Good luck, man. Get it checked out",,,,,,,,,,,

It wouldn't be surprising if some doctors have NEVER seen a patient with a spinal cord injury or maybe 1 or 2.

6998,I looked and found nothing concrete. Really there probably wont be any literature or recommendations because it's a really atypical thing to isolate.  People who can move do it by moving. The muscular contractions work to continually move fluid.

7002,"Take what i say here with a grain of salt, I'm no doctor.  Massage of edematous areas works the same as all the others, it moves fluid.  It will work better in combination with any of the other techniques. So in answer; How much and how often, as often as you feel just don't squeeze hard enough to do any damage. Or don't do it and wear some compressions. Also some pedal edema isn't inherently damaging or dangerous, so as long as it clears when you sleep each night and your skin stays healthy I personally wouldn't spend a lot of my time rubbing my feet.",,,,,,,,,,,

I screamed and a nurse came in and I said I had no idea what was going on but it hurt. When the pee stopped, I took the catheter out and there was a stone lodged in the eyelet. I guess Iâ€™m lucky because I was able to get it stuck in the eyelet and it probably offered my urethra some protection. I didnâ€™t feel the stone in my ureter or kidney, though. It hurt like a bitch and it happened 2 more times in the hospital, but those stones were small enough to go down the catheter.",,,,,,,,,,,

I made peace with my injury and the possibility of never moving from my neck down, the minute I was conscious and aware. All I wanted in return was to see my family again. It allowed me to move forward and appreciate every barrier I would overcome and any improvement became a bonus and a milestone that I could savor.

7023,"Hoping for the best is good and all but I urge you not to set unrealistic expectations. And that goes for your uncle and everyone who is supporting him.

7025,"Independence is the first thing I missed and wanted to regain. It's the first thing you realize that you've taken for granted your entire life and your SCI will make you very aware of that. The goal is to be as independent as possible within the parameters of your injury. There's a fine line between helping someone with a SCI and taking away their independence. Get used to asking if he needs help before jumping in. It is frustrating feeling coddled and equally as bad feeling guilty or being a burden. As he improves, he will need less help. As he regains his independence, he will also regain his confidence and feel more whole again.

7027,"I was told that I had about 18 months post injury to get as much improvement back as possible. I only had access to 3 months of rehab. Scheduled PT times were good but I eventually went as often as I could outside of the scheduled times just to get stronger. I volunteered for a SCI research study at my local University which indirectly gave me more PT and challenged my body further. I signed up for outpatient rehab which gave me another couple of months, but also proved valuable. So I'd encourage your uncle to dedicate as much time to getting stronger, learning as many skills as possible to be more independent, and for everyone to be supportive, but mindful of his goals towards being self sufficient.",,,,,,,,,,,
7028,,,,,,,,,,,,
7029,"I'm an anomaly and incredibly blessed that my post injury recovery worked out better for me than for many other quads out there. But I know that the steps I took also played a huge role in getting me to where I am today, walking completely unassisted, focusing on my health, and traveling solo as a digital nomad. The support I received and continue to receive from friends and family along my journey is amazing, and I can already see from your post, that your uncle already has that going for him as well. Best of luck to him and your family on this journey!",,,,,,,,,,,
7030,This road wonâ€™t be easy and it wonâ€™t be short. But it sounds like you have a tight nit family that will help support one another. There might be set backs and there might be times where progress is so slow you wonder if there has been any. But keep your head up and know that you can always reach out on here and ask for advice or whatever you need. Take care of yourself and Goodluck.,,,,,,,,,,,
7031,"First, Iâ€™m so sorry about your uncle and I think youâ€™re doing one of the best possible things you can - reaching out and looking for support. I would encourage you to join the Discord server. While the majority of the active users are individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCIs), I have no doubt you would be welcomed and that everyone would be happy to offer support (whether that just means listening, or something like answering a specific question). Thereâ€™s also a â€œfamily and friendsâ€� channel within the Discord so you may also be able to find others in your position.",,,,,,,,,,,
7032,,,,,,,,,,,,
7033,"What you, your family and most importantly your uncle are going through right now, in my opinion, is one of the more difficult parts of a SCI. I say that because immediately after an injury, itâ€™s often impossible to know what things will look like long-term. Everyone has a million questions, and sometimes the doctors, in an effort to not offer false hope, will say things that can seem really discouraging. The best advice I think I can offer you at this particular stage is to keep in the back of your mind that whatever function or lack thereof youâ€™re seeing in your uncle right now can (and likely will) change. How someone functions immediately after their injury isnâ€™t always the best indicator of how thin",s will,e lon,-term.,,,,,,,,
7034,,,,,,,,,,,,
7035,"Obviously I canâ€™t speak to your uncleâ€™s situation specifically, and even if I had all of the medical details in front of me, I still wouldnâ€™t be able to give you very much information as far as6 months from now. Every SCI is different, and even two people with injuries at the same level can have vastly different levels of function.",,,,,,,,,,,
7036,,,,,,,,,,,,
7037,"Iâ€™m going to leave you with all that. Again, do consider joining the Discord, even if all you ever do is just stay in the background and read what everyone else is saying. No one knows what a SCI is like and how it can impact and change your life better than someone who has one. And donâ€™t lose sight of the fact that this is a marathon, not a sprint, and what you see now is not an accurate representation of what things will be like after some time passes, and especially once your uncle is medically stabilized and transfers into a rehab centre.",,,,,,,,,,,
7038,,,,,,,,,,,,
7039,"Not really sure how helpful all of that was, but just know youâ€™re not alone, and neither is your uncle. For me, having the support system that I do, including my friends and family, has been so, so helpful. Hopefully youâ€™ll get some additional responses here from others as well.",,,,,,,,,,,
7040,,,,,,,,,,,,

7043,"Just remember that nothing is forever. There were times during my recovery that I felt like my life was over but that passed. Take every day as it comes - whatever is the norm for your uncle today won't be the norm in a couple weeks, a month, a year. Things will get better, even though it doesn't feel like it right now. Your family is in my thoughts and prayers",,,,,,,,,,,
7044,All I can say is while the situation can look bleak just no doctors still can't determine how much function can come back I have seen guys who are vegetables and eventually get finger movement and start to walk in a frame things are very possible you just need to keep a strong mindset because even if things don't come back what is the point in having a negative attitude anyway,,,,,,,,,,,

I didn't ask him back then, I kinda just assumed he could, so i dont know wether he needs viagra or anything. Would it be best to ask him before getting in bed together, or while in bed you reckon?

7223,There is an obvious disconnect from brain to penis because we no longer get hard from visual naked women or men if that's your pleasure. I am 40 yrs post injury & in the first 20 yrs I easily got erections from any kind of  physical stimulation. When the erections died out my Dr. prescribed testosterone & within a week the morning erections were back. Testosterone levels fluctuate & are debatable having higher levels in the AM than late in the day.,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe I damages my back there as well so that mechanism is subdued and I can feel my dick it's just it only works while watching porn and in no way do I get a boner from just looking at it. Non injured people get about a 60% erection male or female from them mental stimulation and the rest is reflex through touch and it maintains so they sustain as long as they are aroused with messages and touch.

7229,Did it return on its own or did medication or therapy help?Iâ€™m C6 too. Were you athletic or have a high sex drive? I always wondered if being an athlete meant I was more in tune with my body and just understood this stuff more than average.How old were you when you got injured? Iâ€™m wondering if my feelings are skewed because Iâ€™m comparing to a 16 year old boy.What do you mean she attacks it? Like she criticizes you?,,,,,,,,,,,
7230,,,,,,,,,,,,
7231,The erections will depend on a lot of the injury. It can take some experimentation to find something that works. Medication like viagra it a gel or an injection.Also age is a factor. Iâ€™m incomplete quad. When I was 17 after my injury Iâ€™d get boners just from moving around after being stationary. But Iâ€™m 36 now and I get them much less frequently. Mild ones from stimulation maybe once a day but the really good ones are maybe once every month or two these days.Thanks! Iâ€™ve ordered some maca root.

Pain is magnified when your not getting enough sleep or your depressed. Can also be worse in winter months especially if you live in a cold climate.",,,,,,,,,,,
7590,"I don't know if this is an option, but Josh Sundquist posted a video on YouTube recently. He's the amputee with the great Halloween costumes. He had increasing nerve (phantom) pain issues, and apparently if you connect the severed end of the nerve to a muscle so it kind of has a ""job"" again, there's a decent chance the pain will go away. Might be worth checking if that could also work for sci nerve pain issues, and maybe the damn thing is even close enough to something where rerouting it could end up giving you something useful/functional?",,,,,,,,,,,

7664,,,,,,,,,,,,
7665,"2. When I first got my pump I was going in every few months to get it refilled. Now I'm going in about every six weeks. So as you need to increase your medication rate. The time to go get it refilled will shorten. I've helped reduce that by also using medical cannabis. Also, if you end up getting it I would schedule all your refills a week before your alarm date just in case there's a malfunction. Since major withdrawals from that concentration of Baclofen can kill you if it's not treated quickly. The pump has an internal alarm that will let you know if there's something wrong with the pump.",,,,,,,,,,,

7667,Those are the two main things. If I can think of off the top of my of any more I'll post again. It was definitely a game-changer for me. I was on 2 other muscle relaxers and Baclofen. I no longer use any of them.,,,,,,,,,,,
7668,"Iâ€™m late coming to this post, and you mightâ€™ve already gotten the pump by now, but after having 90mg oral baclofen daily doing nothing for my spasms, I elected to get the pump.

My old friends donâ€™t get it, docs donâ€™t care, family just gets sad when my pain/gate/paralysis issues get brought up. I also have to deal with the fact my car accident took my friends life when we were 16yrs old in 2006. I still wear the same broken and ducted tape back together for 13yrs.

7762,"Could you share the name of the Facebook group?  Iâ€™d love to join!Self catheter..newbie looking for advice!Glad to hear surgery went well,  sounds like you will have an easier time adjusting. I think UTIs are mainly caused by not draining the bladder all the way and over time it can form a UTI, i could be wrong. I was Hospitalized once for a UTI... I thought i just had the Flu, so watch for shivers and fevers as these can be signs. Have you tried bladder relaxing medication? I take 8mg Toviaz every morning and can tell the diff if i forget to take it. Otherwise just be mindful of how much you drink and when also what. Coffee makes me go more frequently, and try to avoid large amounts of liquid hours before b",d.,,,,,,,,,,
7763,Self cathing can be challenging the beginning but it sounds like you're motivated to learn I personally have found hydrophilic catheters to be much easier to deal with. Here's my process,,,,,,,,,,,
7764,,,,,,,,,,,,
7765,Grab a cath prep the Cath( break water sactche and shake),,,,,,,,,,,
7766,Move forward on my chair,,,,,,,,,,,
7767,pull my pants down,,,,,,,,,,,
7768,Use some hand sanitizer,,,,,,,,,,,
7769,Grab what one wipe the tip,,,,,,,,,,,
7770,Place cloth in the spill area,,,,,,,,,,,
7771,Place pee bottle between legs,,,,,,,,,,,
7772,"Insert, breathing and going slowly are important.",,,,,,,,,,,
7773,,,,,,,,,,,,
7774,When removing I pull out the cath a bit and put a bit of pressure on my bladder to ensure full drainage,,,,,,,,,,,
7775,,,,,,,,,,,,
7776,Finally when ready to remove. Place finger on the end of the Cath to prevent. any back drainage. Remove while taking deep breaths on the out breath.,,,,,,,,,,,
7777,,,,,,,,,,,,
7778,Hope that was helpful good luck! Best UTI prevention I have found is drinking a bunch of water.,,,,,,,,,,,
7779,"There are two main types of intermittent catheters - pre-lubed and not. If your insurance allows a prelubricated catheter Iâ€™d go for it, especially if you have sensation. If not you can get a regular catheter like a hollister apogee and and lube it using little packets instead.",,,,,,,,,,,
7780,,,,,,,,,,,,
7781,Itâ€™s not hard to learn - I was taught over a weekend when I was 8. Just know itâ€™s important to establish a clean routine for how and where you self cath. Work with your nurses and rehab people to try a variety of catheters your insurance will cover so you can pick the one that works best for you. Itâ€™s helpful to understand the anatomy so hopefully theyâ€™ll have an educator whoâ€™ll walk you through it.,,,,,,,,,,,
7782,Are you a male or female?,,,,,,,,,,,
7783,My suggestions are a) use prelubed catheters if they are covered by insurance. I use Cure Ultra and I've been very happy with them. b) use some sort of antiseptic every time. I get Wet One's Singles and carry 6 catheters and 6 wet ones each day. c) carry one set in your pocket and the rest in your backpack or whatever. Then whenever you are in the restroom you have the supplies you need.,,,,,,,,,,,
7784,"Hey all, very happy to find this thread.",,,,,,,,,,,

7786,My mother was recently told by her doctor that she needs to administer some medicine to her bladder via self catheter.,,,,,,,,,,,
7787,,,,,,,,,,,,
7788,"Sheâ€™s 70 and was a nurse most of her life and has definitely administered many catheters to others, but is very nervous about self administering and worried about pain. She tells me she has a very narrow urethra (sorry if thatâ€™s TMI) and though she has purchased the smallest catheters is still concerned about their size and pain.",,,,,,,,,,,

7800,"For me, it doesnâ€™t hurt at all but Iâ€™m not sure if that is because I have no feeling down there or if it just doesnâ€™t hurt, hard to for me know as Iâ€™m still in recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,
7801,,,,,,,,,,,,
7802,"I hope all goes well for your mum!Spending a lot of time figuring out what is and is not a problem below the level of injury - does this get easier over time?Yes it gets easier with time. Iâ€™m ~19 years out and can know when Iâ€™ve been siting on my butt too long, when I need to pee, when I need to poo, when Iâ€™m getting diarrhea cramps, when my injured knee hurts, when Iâ€™m about to cum(and what feels good to get there). And I canâ€™t feel anything below my arms. My signals are all from dysreflexia (changes in BP, chills, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,
7803,"How long have you been injured? It takes time to learn what signals mean what. I consider my legs like solar panels. Keep a blanket on your lap and make sure theyâ€™re warm. As quadriplegics we are always cold. Get a $35 trapper hat off of Amazon and a heat dish from Cosco . At night you can use a $35 matches warmer off of Amazon as well. If you are talking about the hair standing up on your head/neck (signs of oncoming AD) then it could be a bunch of things: sitting on a wrinkle, signs of catheter starting to clog, hangnail, signals you may be getting backed up. It definitely gets easier",,,,,,,,,,,
7804,"Awesome, like I've learnt some things - like checking changes in BP, and chills but everything else has fallen into the 'oh I feel weird' thing and then having to spend sometimes a long time trying to figure out why. Weight shifting I'm pretty good at, but that's just out of habit more than anything else. For bladder rn I check BP and bowel is program. Most of my signals are from dysreflexia beyond some nerve pain.",,,,,,,,,,,
7805,,,,,,,,,,,,
7806,"Good to know it gets easier, I kinda assumed it did but wanted to check because maybe I was wrong and I just had to learn to deal.Not that long, about 3 months - the cold thing is something I learnt pretty quickly, because winter struck harsh where I live but its good to know that you can at least learn what the signals mean because right now, just trying to check everything when I feel something is difficult. I had a preexisting smaller lesion prior to this injury(very small at C2 and then larger at C5/6), and it never caused that much bother except bladder and some motor, so learning how to assess things I can't feel is pretty new.",,,,,,,,,,,
7807,,,,,,,,,,,,
7808,"Take tonight, chills, hair standing up on back of neck like you say, and some worsening tremors and it turned out that wearing these specific jeans with buttons on the back pockets is just a really bad idea. I'm fine now, but it took me a while to figure that out.",,,,,,,,,,,

7817,"From my (limited) understanding, the vertebral level referenced on the ASIA scale is the lowest (""most caudal"") point of normal function. So if your injury is at C5, the reference to C4 that your doctor gave you is the right technical answer. But I would agree that the specifics of your ASIA impairment scale ""score"" won't mean much to most people.

7819,"Mostly, depending on context, we'd describe her accident (in more or less brutal terms depending on the tone of the question: she was knocked off her bicycle and run over by a school bus, which has pretty strong shock value if you want to shut down questions from nosy busybodies...) and just say that she has a spinal cord injury and is paraplegic. Medically speaking, she's T9 ASIA A, but that's meaningless to anybody who hasn't any experience in the world of SCI.",,,,,,,,,,,

7821,Thanks everyone. I definitely appreciate the insight. It is certainly somewhat confusing but when I speak to most people just telling them it's a spinal cord injury is all they care to know.

I broke my neck 11 years ago...blah blah blahâ€�. By doing so you acknowledge the elephant in the room and build rapport w/ the students. And, if you are doing 6th grade the kids will love this (from my experience) because they are curious monkeys. Use the opportunity to advocate for people with disabilities. If they have any questions, tell them you will discuss them individually during their break or lunch.",,,,,,,,,,,
7845,"-As for classroom management, just be a leader. Tell them you will show them respect if they give you respect. Talk to them never down to them.

8213,,,,,,,,,,,,
8214,Your bladder is a muscle. Think of it as a stretchy bag. But it only holds so much and then the bag leaks. The Botox will relax the walls of your bladder so it will hold more urine and not leak. So the bag wonâ€™t become bigger but itâ€™ll stretch more before it starts to overflow.,,,,,,,,,,,
8215,,,,,,,,,,,,
8216,In your past posts youâ€™ve talked about how you are leaking a lot. The Botox will help you not to leak so much between caths.,,,,,,,,,,,

8224,But if youâ€™re nervous talk to your doctor. If youâ€™re not 100% understanding what will happen then you donâ€™t have full informed consent and you donâ€™t need to proceed.,,,,,,,,,,,
8225,No need to worry....had it done numerous times & it doesn't always work...it depends if the botox is injected in the exact right area & also depends the amount of botox used. You might not see a big difference & if it relaxes bladder to much you can still press on your bladder & push out urine every 3-4 hrs. It has NO affect on bowel care,,,,,,,,,,,

8393,My fiancÃ© is a C5 and we have a Reverie bed. Itâ€™s really two beds and each can be adjusted independently. The heads and feet raise up and there are â€œmassageâ€� settings as well. We absolutely LOVE our bed.,,,,,,,,,,,
8394,I have a Nectar. Cheap and its great. My neck pain completely vanished and my back pain went down considerably. Main reason I got one is they have a 365 day trial period in which you can return it (they send someone to pick it up) no questions asked. All other matresses have 100 days or less.,,,,,,,,,,,
8395,"Thatâ€™s what I really like about the sleep number is the pressure relief and all the adjustments you can do! Which sleep number do you have??How big of a worry is this? This is the first time I ever heard about this so Im assuming the effect is negligible.Anyone who stopped taking medication for nerve pain, how do you manage?[deleted]",,,,,,,,,,,
8396,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,
8397,I slowly weaned off of all of my medication and I am a C1 complete. So I don't take any medication that deals with nerve medicine I don't even take Tylenol for that matter. To be honest what helped me the most was going to a chiropractor which is completely against medical advice but it helped me a whole lot. Also I bought a TENS machine that actually helps my right shoulder out whenever I do feel any sort of pain. Fairly inexpensive on Amazon,,,,,,,,,,,
8398,"I was on quite a bit of Pregabalin when I had my injury, but slowly built it off. I'm used to the consistent tingling (it used to be painful) and from time to time I have a period where I have extra pain. A sharp pain at like 30 sec intervals. Paracetamol helps dull that, but it does affect my mood and sleep. Now I don't use any medication and it really helped improve my energy and mood, so I'm happy I did it. I'd say try to slowly decrease your dose and then try to go without for a period. Pain management immensely differs per individual. You might be able to go to a pain policlinic to see what you can do to decrease your dependence on medication.",,,,,,,,,,,
8399,I was lucky to only have pain for the first 6-8 months.  I never took medication and decided to suck it up.  It was a constant 5-6/10 and never went away.  It came to a point where I had forgotten what no pain felt like and it became the norm.  Then seemingly within a matter of 4-6 weeks it all went away.,,,,,,,,,,,
8400,,,,,,,,,,,,
8401,&#x200B;,,,,,,,,,,,
8402,,,,,,,,,,,,
8403,Hard to know how bad your pain is but you could try weening yourself off meds and potentially off entirely on the premise that you are ok tolerating some level of constant pain.,,,,,,,,,,,
8404,"I was on gabapentin for like 3 years (2 years before my injury but thatâ€™s another story), 300mg 3x/day, then pregabalin for another 2 years, 150 mg 3x/day. it sucked going off it. I went off super slowly, I think I gradually lowered my dose for a couple of months. I had a lot of pain at first because of stopping the meds but itâ€™s been getting better. now itâ€™s always present and sometimes bad enough to be distracting, but the side effects of the meds were worse, and lyrica is super freaking expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,
8405,I had high frequency spinal cord stimulators installed which fixed (quieted) my nerve pain.    I couldnâ€™t do the gaba and lyrica anymore.  (Was taking tons and never worked that well to begin with.  Check out the Nevro HF10 unit implant.,,,,,,,,,,,
8406,Iâ€™m currently taking Gabapentin 600mg 3x daily. Started at 400 but went up when I felt like it wasnâ€™t doing much for me. Now I feel the same way about the 600 lol.,,,,,,,,,,,
8407,So I totally understand what you mean by missing a dose or two of Gabapentin and not noticing. My injury happened 3 years ago btw. I started looking into other shit that would help besides medicine too (my goal is to come off everything eventually).,,,,,,,,,,,
8408,"I mean, I donâ€™t know every single thing that youâ€™ve tried but what about applying something with heat like a heating pad? This is something that helps me tremendously. I use cbd oil and cbd cream occasionally too which does help ofc. Iâ€™ve also tried soaking in warm water with epsom salt which is pretty nice.",,,,,,,,,,,
8409,,,,,,,,,,,,
8410,I know this isnâ€™t much but using a heating pad is seriously the top choice for me atm. Just anything with heat lol.  It just does the most.,,,,,,,,,,,
8411,Ugh I seriously wish I could help more. But I hope you find the relief youâ€™re looking for. If you ever want to talk or anything Iâ€™m here anytime!,,,,,,,,,,,
8412,"Sorry to hear about what youre going through :( I have an incomplete C7 injury and get terrible nerve pain also. I found taking 2000 mg of agmatine does help a small amount, which is a natural supplement. Also for some reason when I stop eating gluten or grains I experience less pain than normal. Another thing that helps decrease the pain is CBD, it's something I smoke before sleeping every night",,,,,,,,,,,
8413,"I just weaned off them - it hurts like hell some days but I'm working towards trying to manage my pain with OTC medications right now to try and get off opiods so I've had to come to the conclsuion that yeah, its going to really hurt sometimes. After a while, you do become acclimatised to the nerve pain and it just is and you don't really notice it but there can still be difficult days.",,,,,,,,,,,
8414,"What do you mean by ""vape flower""?Hahaha! I appreciate your honesty.Thank you. I was an incredibly wary person with regards to medication before I had my surgery. Aftwards I was put on gabapentin and baclofen, then the gabapentin was swapped for duloxetine, and now I'm taking pregabalin with the duloxetine and baclofen. I'm taking extra vitamins and supplements to counter the effects of the medication. It seems like since this happened to me, I'm on increasingly more medication as the years go by. I just can't help but wonder what the rest of my life will be like as a result of this medication.What side effects did you get from the GabaI've been on pregabalin / lyrica for years only 75 mg twice a day, but when",I tried,to we,n off,struggled wi,h i,so,nia,in,rea,ed nerv,pain

8443,My feelings on all this have also gone up lately too. The girl I mentioned in the original post has started slowly coming back in my life. It just brings up all this stuff.

8446,,,,,,,,,,,,
8447,As you pointed out you suffer from PTSD when you go back to work. Whether it is the same setting in which your accident occurred or not due to the fact that it is the same job it can trigger PTSD. Although I cannot relate so your situation I think you're on the right track and going back to school to pursue a different career or even pursuing a different job within a different setting will help you.,,,,,,,,,,,
8448,PTSD and even triggered grief is very common post injury. It can be difficult to not let it get in your head. I would honestly seek out a therapist that you feel comfortable with who can help you process some of this stuff. I'm also C6 ~20 years post and wish I would have then at least every 6 months or so. The mental parts are often the biggest source of struggle for me.,,,,,,,,,,,

8458,"Dealing with urology is scary and frustrating in my experience. After none of the pills did anything for me, I had the botox injection. It didn't work for me. There weren't any noticeable side effects, but there wasn't any real improvement. I then went through a bladder augmentation surgery in January 2018. The positive effects took a while to stabilize, but now my bladder holds at least 500ml before signaling through autonomic dysreflexia that it needs to empty and it does a good job holding until I'm able to get to a bathroom. Your situation will get better. You are doing the right thing by going through the process with urology.",,,,,,,,,,,

8687,"As for me,  I never had an ""oh shit"" moment. I just woke up from surgery with my legs not working well.  I did the therapy stuff and at first it didn't work,  but then it did.   I was really calm and practical about the whole thing.  I felt like my legs worked enough that I could do most things I wanted to do in life (which was partly true and partly denial).  I was already used to using a wheelchair and I felt like I could still get to the second story of my house by crawling.  Lucky me I got enough function back that I can walk pretty well as long as I pace myself and am not too tired.",,,,,,,,,,,

8692,Skiing accident for me.  Completely paralyzed from middle of my chest down. I crashed into a wooden fence. When I opened my eyes I couldn't feel anything below that point.  I accepted it pretty much immediately and knew I would never walk again. Even remember telling my girlfriend at the time I was never gonna walk again but everything was gonna be okay still as I was being loaded into the ambulance.  And surprisingly I was actually okay with that. Some other parts of SCI are pretty shit (shitting/pissing/pain etc) but the not walking never bothered me a whole lot.,,,,,,,,,,,

8706,,,,,,,,,,,,
8707,1: Make sure you eat  enough food. Food pushes things along. I go every other day and by day 2 I'm usually getting tight and assume I'm not hungry so people have to remind me to eat.,,,,,,,,,,,

8777,,,,,,,,,,,,
8778,My main recommendation is to take \~1 year or so of proper 5 day a week gym work before hopping on.  You want to have made good natural progress first and make sure you've regained as much function as possible.  You also want to be sure you know how to train and make gains naturally.  This way you'll maximise the effects of a cycle.  Diet for lifting is still extremely important.,,,,,,,,,,,

Imo (I am not a physical therapist nor a doctor or anything) if I were you I'd be using some anavar at probably 20-40mg/day to aid you during physical therapy, this will not suppress your natural testosterone production to the extent that a full blown testosterone enanthate injection cycle will (it still will suppress you though and you should still do a PCT after), while still giving you an edge during your therapy and giving you some strength increase.

8850,Try to test drive a smart drive and get by with that for as long as you can. you lose a lot of convenience with a power wheelchair - you will now have to consider whether any surface you roll onto can support the 300-400lb chair plus your weight. And you will only be able to transport the chair in a vehicle set up for it.  Smartdrive is very popular. Just be careful swinging it into your trunk (boot?)  to avoid rotator cuff injuries.,,,,,,,,,,,

8856,"Depending on where the individual lives, a wheelchair specialist should evaluate your friend. Check with any Permobil or Mobility Works dealership and ask for referrals. Good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,
8857,Make sure the physician and therapy team know that the chair is limiting his participation in rehab.  That is something they can use to justify a better chair through insurance.  A proper fit wheelchair is extremely important.,,,,,,,,,,,
8858,"Echoing what others have said, definitely consult professionals about a chair. A proper place will measure him and ensure everything is the right size and properly supported. Commonly, people use a seating specialist company that act as middleman between consumers, and chair companies (and they deal with all the insurance bullshit that goes along with buying a chair.)  I personally use National Seating and Mobility, but it all really depends on where you are located. PT/OT at your family member's facility should know what to use.",,,,,,,,,,,
8859,,,,,,,,,,,,
8860,"Also, something worth noting. You said he's newly injured.  There is an adjustment period to wheelchairs, even properly fitted ones. Our bodies are not designed to sit all the time, so discomfort is definitely a thing -  early on, especially.  Not to discredit the ill-fitting chair he has, but encouraging him to just sit over time to get used to it is a good idea. I remember while in rehab, lying in bed was >>>>> sitting in the hospital chair (especially with back surgery recovery - the incision, the staples, the soreness from just wrecking my back...) But the more he does it, the easier it gets.",,,,,,,,,,,

He was still in bed but I knew that his dad was bringing in the family dog for a visit for the first time all summer and so I told a nurse that he'd have to be gotten up. They said they had to wait for someone to come but that they would be in very shortly.,,,,,,,,,,,
8866,,,,,,,,,,,,
8867,While I was feeding him the gyro his stepmom came in and said we'd have to finish in the court yard. I was in the middle of saying there was only a few bits left and I'll probably finish before the nurse comes in when she leaned across his bed and grabbed at his blanket. I heard him start saying desperately 'but im not wearing pants!' And in the middle of that sentence saw an adult dipper. I dropped the gyro and vacated out of  respect for my older Male cousin. Leaving all of my stuff in the room.,,,,,,,,,,,
8868,,,,,,,,,,,,
8869,But he shouldn't have had that happen to him. She should've respected him enough to ask permission before removing the blanket. He should have more say in his life then that.,,,,,,,,,,,
8870,,,,,,,,,,,,
8871,"A comfortable chair will make it so he wants to spend more time in it. His father and step mom will get off the facilities back and his back. The last thing I heard as I was leaving the room was how uncomfortable he said the chair was. The thing is, he's said it multiple of times in front of me, and his father. I asked his father about it and he said he sat in it for a bit and didn't see anything wrong with it. There's a difference between a few minutes and a few hours though and I feel like this isn't just helping him get real food a few times a week, this is different and bigger and I don't know how to make the right people do something about this and from the responses I got on here it sounds like I can't h",lp with,this.,,,,,,,,,
8872,,,,,,,,,,,,
8873,"Rant over.Thanks. It's so hard though. His father (family member is well over 18.) Is difficult to deal with sometimes and he is the one who is listed as the person taking care of everything. I'd have to talk to him for that and I know he'd either just brush me off or say he'd handle it even though he doesn't have the money and then resent me for butting in.I get that there is an adjustment period but he was at a facility until recently and never said anything about that chair. Sure some days he'd try staying in bed all day, but he never once complained about the chair. He isn't one to complain, really. That's how I know for certain that this chair is that bad.",,,,,,,,,,,

8876,"So from what youâ€™re saying, youâ€™re doing the program in the morning but having accidents at night too?",,,,,,,,,,,
8877,,,,,,,,,,,,
8878,"In the beginning, I had the same problem. Started the bowel program early in the morning and gave myself about an hour and a half (because thatâ€™s what they taught in rehab) but it wasnâ€™t ever enough. I was having accidents later on in the day during therapy and stuff which is extremely frustrating and embarrassing. I decided to switch to nights and that got me on the right track. I no longer had to worry about having an accident during any therapy or while being out and about. The accidents were now happening throughout the night unfortunately lol. So I just extended the bowel program, first to 2 hours and then found 3 hours was like the perfect amount of time.",,,,,,,,,,,
8879,"Iâ€™m not sure if youâ€™re taking any stool softeners or other bowel medications but I am and Iâ€™ve had to adjust them either by taking less, more or switching the times. I now take 1 Colace in the morning with 2 Bisacodyls, 2 Senna in the afternoon, 1 more Colace at night and then use a suppository for the program. Between giving myself more time and adjusting my medications, I sorta found the perfect combination for me. You also have to make sure to drink a lot of fluids and eat foods to help keep things moving.",,,,,,,,,,,
8880,,,,,,,,,,,,
8881,So basically itâ€™s a lot of trial and error. You really have to pay attention to what your body is doing and just adjust things here and there. I know it can get very frustrating but youâ€™ll get it with some time. In my opinion youâ€™re better switching the program to nights to avoid the accidents possibly happening during something important. Just start there.,,,,,,,,,,,
8882,Sorry this is so long lol but if you have any questions or anything feel free to message me!,,,,,,,,,,,
8883,"just one comment , you half to do the trial and error. After 31yrs. I still read any info cuz I might be able to make things better.

8927,Successful rehab and walking are not the same thing and it can be really discouraging to link the two.  It's going to be a long process and there are many losses associated with a spinal cord injury beyond the use of the legs. Don't focus so much on the legs that you forget about the person.

I had my accident on the same day our nation was attacked, September 11, 2001. I'll be reflecting on the day. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCPF53OFxqpUr1a32NshBNwMy fingers are starting to curl inPersonally, I prefer my curled up as I can hook things easier and means my tenodesis is more effective.",,,,,,,,,,,
9001,My fingers curled completely but theyâ€™re not flat by any means. My OT gave me some splits to wear to help straighten my fingers but didnâ€™t use them for very long (5-6 weeks) as I found them clunky are kept catching on things.,,,,,,,,,,,
9002,"Physical therapist here - you actually want your fingers to be able to maintain that curled position. There's something called the ""tenodesis grip,"" which refers to using your active wrist extension (which facilitates automatic finger flexion) for grip purposes when you don't have those wrist and finger flexion muscles. It's extremely functional and helpful at your level of injury! Stretching the fingers out can actually decrease this grip mechanism over time.",,,,,,,,,,,
9003,"I usually sleep with my head on my hands to keep them flat, not terribly comfy but seems to help.",,,,,,,,,,,
9004,"I'm just over 8 years in, and I agree with a lot of the people here for the most part. The curling does help with holding and picking up some objects. I still stretch out my fingers throughout the day, and my right hand can lay flat without any help. My left hand is more tight because I use it to hold my phone all the time. There are advantages to both, but I think they will almost always eventually curl.",,,,,,,,,,,

9031,"Well, first Ill say I am sorry to hear about your dad. A spinal cord injury at any age is never easy to deal with, unfortunately for people your dads age they don't exactly have time on their side, this makes recovery challenging. on the positive side it sounds like he is already able to move his legs, that should get slightly better over time, but not likely to recover to the point before the injury. hopefully he will recover to the point of being able to stand or take a few steps even for a small amount of time just to pivot to seat to seat, But only time will tell (that may sound devastating and terrible because its hard for you to put your dad in that kind of situation.

9057,"I have come to love condom caths.  It took a lot of trial and error to figure out how they work best, but it's worth it.  You can't leave urine in there very long or it will loosen the adhesive and then will spill out.  I also try and get it on as high up as I can so it covers as much of the penis as possible and pinch the top so there's no air.  Strangely enough I have found if I only leak a little it seeps down and removes the adhesive quicker than if it fills up so I do try and drink a lot of water.  Multiple bathroom stops is the downside of course.",,,,,,,,,,,
9058,"I too, have an incomplete spinal cord injury. Something that I noticed was causing me to have issues, was whenever I had a bladder infection. I am assuming that you may have had issues with those as well. That could be contributing to things? I am taking Utiva uti infection control, and that seems to be helping. I have heard that Botox can help too. I guess the only thing to make sure to find out is if it helps in people that can not have any ability to hold their bladder at all. I hope you find something that helps!!",,,,,,,,,,,
9059,Yep you need the scan. Botox only works on certain types of bladder dysfunction and incomplete folks donâ€™t always have the type of neurogenic bladder that Botox treats. I am surprised he didnâ€™t order urodynamics (where they fill you with saline til you leak to test your bladder reflex responses) and cystoscopy.,,,,,,,,,,,
9060,,,,,,,,,,,,
9061,"Botox involves 20 tiny injections into your bladder wall to weaken it so it is less prone to contracting under stress and emptying your bladder unexpectedly. If your bladder is voiding when you stress it it might help you by reducing an overly active empty response. If itâ€™s a sphincter only issue botox might not be the only answer. The only downsides to Botox is that it can weaken tone in the area around your bladder that you might rely upon, ie your stomach muscle tone helping you with transfers.  It also can be expensive if you have no coverage. Thereâ€™s a small chance of UTI each time so they often put you on a short course of antibiotics ahead of the injections.",,,,,,,,,,,
9062,,,,,,,,,,,,
9063,For me it took my tiny very spastic 100 mL bladder to a 350+ ml bladder. I now only catheterize 4x/day and have no leaks when transferring which was my most common problem. I have to set an alarm to remind me to pee though because Botox removes my sensation of needing to pee.,,,,,,,,,,,
9064,,,,,,,,,,,,
9065,Iâ€™m really sorry you missed out on the basics but if it makes you feel better Botox was only used for bladder dysfunction starting 12 years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,

9228,Hello everyone!  I founded Spinal Singularity a few years ago to build this product and try to offer an alternative to Intermittent and Foley catheters.  I was sick of using disposable catheters every day and also didn't want a Foley.  I thought it would be cool if there was a device that allowed you to empty your bladder with the push of a button.,,,,,,,,,,,
9229,,,,,,,,,,,,
9230,We have conducted two clinical studies on the device and are in the middle of our third study.  This study will get us the data we need to get the product cleared for use by the FDA.,,,,,,,,,,,
9231,,,,,,,,,,,,
9232,With this product we tried to leverage the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of intermittent/foley catheters.,,,,,,,,,,,
9233,,,,,,,,,,,,
9234,1. Our product lasts for up to 7 days in the body so you only would have to insert one instead of \~50 disposable catheters each week.,,,,,,,,,,,
9235,"2. It is fully internal to the body so it doesn't hang out like a Foley, which we hope will improve clinical outcomes like UTI.",,,,,,,,,,,
9236,3. It is non-surgical and can be inserted or removed by a user very quickly and easily.  So if it doesn't work or you prefer to go back to your old catheters then you can do so at any time.,,,,,,,,,,,
9237,,,,,,,,,,,,
9238,If you know anyone who is interested in learning more please feel free to refer them to me and also to our websites below.  We have clinical sites all across the US and are actively looking for new patients to support our study.  Thanks!!!,,,,,,,,,,,

9493,1. Oral baclofen makes you super drowsy and even after the adjustment period itâ€™s like living on Benadryl. Once you try the pump youâ€™ll be amazed how much more energy you have.,,,,,,,,,,,
9494,,,,,,,,,,,,
9495,2. Donâ€™t have to carry around and remember to take your medicine. You carry a roughly 4-6 month reserve inside the pump.,,,,,,,,,,,
9496,,,,,,,,,,,,
9497,3. Never have to worry about baclofen withdrawals. If youâ€™ve never had one you donâ€™t want one.  The spasms are terrible and itâ€™s like having Parkinsonâ€™s.,,,,,,,,,,,
9498,I have one. I was at 90mg daily oral baclofen when I got the pump. Best decision Iâ€™ve made. Itâ€™s substantially better for my everyday life.,,,,,,,,,,,

9505,"Iâ€™ve seen this as a game changer for many people, but also met other people who find they still have spasms afterwards. To echo someone else, they do do a test first, so perhaps try that. Otherwise try dantrolene, as others have said, it helped me. Although I do take 70 mg of baclofen per day, And currently reducing from 80 mg and I will try to get to 40 mg a day if possible. Although I donâ€™t feel this drowsiness or tiredness, and have no problem to stay up 16 hours a day, with seven hours sleep, I want to experiment to see if less baclofen makes any difference to my cognitive ability â€“ I work full time.",,,,,,,,,,,
9506,I also am an incomplete c3 / c4 but with no real motor function other than a real damn good shoulder shrug. I was also crazy spastic before I went through with getting the pump. I refill mine twice a year and when I look back on it I would go through with it again rather than taking a bunch of pills a day. I also smoke a decent amount of cannabis that has helped me along the way.,,,,,,,,,,,
9507,I used to get spasms bad too they turned me into a 2x4 and Iâ€™d end up on the floor I tried the oral baclofen but it put me to sleep ended up getting the pump and itâ€™s been the fuckin best thing Iâ€™ve done it donâ€™t knock me out and controls spasms once you find your sweet spot for dosage youâ€™re golden,,,,,,,,,,,
9508,I donâ€™t have a spinal cord injury but I do have neurological issues and spasticity due to a condition going undiagnosed for too long and it effected my brain and spine. I have three medications in my pump currently and it has made things so much better. I donâ€™t have most of my stomach or intestines so the oral meds I do take donâ€™t work very well. I have baclofen and a numbing agent in the pump along with a pain med. Iâ€™ve had good and bad experiences and can answer just about any question. Feel free to ask away.,,,,,,,,,,,
9509,This may sound ridiculous but get off of the medicine and go see a chiropractor. I got off of it and off of gabapentin and I am a C1 complete,,,,,,,,,,,
9510,"Yes, when every single motion and movement is a literal fight with your own body, spasticity can definitely make you feel like going crazy. The usual ""at least it helps you maintain muscle mass"" isn't much of a comfort either. Haha.",,,,,,,,,,,
9511,,,,,,,,,,,,
9512,"I've tried valium (Oxazepam), and it has some effect. Unfortunately it also makes me fall asleep, so it isn't exactly an option if I also need to function. Never heard of dantrolene, but I'll investigate it.",,,,,,,,,,,

9514,"Thanks for your input!I second this, but I have to get a refill every 2-3 months. Just depends on how well it affects you. It's odd at first having a tiny hockey puck in you.

9527,,,,,,,,,,,,
9528,I just got home from being admitted for UTI and had the same thing happen. I felt like I was cathing more often throughout the day thinking I was full and ignored it till I had some spasms when I was cathing and then leaking a little after which should have been a red flag but didnâ€™t end up going to hospital until I had a 101.8 fever.

9530,"Follow-up: as of yesterday (at the doctor), confirmed as a UTI. She gave me thumbs-up for flushing and also suggested (in future) unsweetened cranberry juice. Apparently, there *really* is something about cranberries, not just the acidity, which helps kill off UTI bacteria.",,,,,,,,,,,

I'll get in touch with my primary on Monday and, hopefully, will be able to have them process things.By the way - thank you, thank you, thank YOU! The iced tea flush seems to have helped tremendously. I woke up overnight, but at closer to 2.5 hr intervals and it was with an actual full bladder. It seems Iâ€™m closer to normal now. Iâ€™ll still give my doctor a call tomorrow to see about at least doing a specimen, but itâ€™s definitely better.Thanks also. That makes a lot of sense. I hadnâ€™t been paying (enough) attention to scent, but that seems to support the theory.",,,,,,,,,,,
9534,,,,,,,,,,,,
9535,"For some reason, I hadnâ€™t thought in terms of flushing things out, but that makes a lot of (short-term) sense, at the very least. Since my main beverage-of-choice is home-brewed, unsweetened, iced tea, I certainly donâ€™t have any trouble with just upping my intake. Heck, might even break out the black currant mix to let it do its thing. Waking up every couple of hours with a legitimately full bladder is certainly better than every hour and the phantom sensation of one.Yep. I have a couple of spare specimen cups at home (still sealed), because itâ€™s easier to generate them at home instead of trying to do so at a lab or urologistâ€™s office as part of my usual pre-visit check.Thanks so much.

I do have a lot of tension in my lower back but I think it's due to using a new wheelchair due to my wits are being repaired at the moment.. my bowels are regular I go every single day. I'm not sure about the CT scan because they gave me two doses of morphine which to not even touch my pain so then they gave me Ativan and I knocked out.

9554,I think most people would give the suggestion of talking to your urologist about getting Botox in your bladder. What are the exact issues you're having? You're just having to go more often than you can cath?,,,,,,,,,,,
9555,"First, don't expect your bladder to hold a tremendous amount of urine. Between [400ml and 600ml is just fine](https://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/picture-of-the-bladder#1); others may have ""huge"" bladders, but it's not how much you can hold, but how much back pressure is created against your kidneys.",,,,,,,,,,,
9556,,,,,,,,,,,,
9557,"Second, drink plenty of water. Not plenty of coffee or caffeinated drinks, but clear water. Caffeinated drinks will cause more frequent urination. If you add a splash of lemon juice to regular water [it will actually turn alkaline in your body (shift the pH up from 7.0)](https://www.healthyfoodhouse.com/why-is-lemon-water-alkaline/).",,,,,,,,,,,
9558,,,,,,,,,,,,
9559,"Third, use a system like the [Bard Touchless system of catheters](http://www.bardcare.com/clinicians/products/view-products/intermittent-catheters/touchless-plus-catheters-and-kits/) as it is trivial to carry a few of the packages with you. They allow you to use any room with a door as a restroom in an urgent situation. I open the kits and repackage them inside a ziploc bag. It's easy to carry seven of them in the back beneath my chair.",,,,,,,,,,,

9561,Good luck and best wishes!,,,,,,,,,,,
9562,Are  you male or female?,,,,,,,,,,,
9563,If you have control of your bladder or if the only one issue is leaking in the morning I highly recommend using condom catheters in the morning. They don't extract the urine from your bladder but they will catch the urine if you leak.,,,,,,,,,,,
9564,"I don't have to go more often than I Cath. It's the mornings that are the worst. Leak a lot in the mornings, rest of the day is fine. Because of the leak in the morning I have to wear incontinence pads. They are pretty difficult to change in a wheelchair. Because of that I have to take assistance in the restroom.Touchless catheters are not yet available in the country I reside. I really wish they were, takes away the pain of carrying so many things and the need for a proper big restroom.I'm a maleAnyone else have tingles in your legsYup, have had them for all 19 years of paralysis.  Since I have a complete injury, I figure they're phantom sensations.",,,,,,,,,,,
9565,,,,,,,,,,,,
9566,"If I run my fingers around my level of injury, I can feel different sensations washing over my legs/hips/feet depending on where my fingers go.  For example, stroking my belly along the right side of my belly button causes a tingly sensation that wraps around the front of my right thigh and around the kneecap.  One inch to the left of my belly button sets off the left thigh; four inches to the left brings tingles to my left shin.",,,,,,,,,,,

I do know that the general consensus is that six months to a year is the window of time when you're most likely to get back any sensation you're going to get back.",,,,,,,,,,,
9571,"I also have a tingling/numbness feeling in my legs, sometimes happening randomly, sometimes when i think about moving my legs, T3-4 complete for almost 2y",,,,,,,,,,,
9572,It sounds like classic nerve pain. C6 complete quad here. I have no sensation from my level of injury down. However I get the tingles youâ€™re referring too. It soon goes from a tingle to feel like my legs and torso are wrapped in a hot compression sleeve thatâ€™s lined with cactus needles. I tried medication like gabbapenton and lyrica but that had me in dark depression with suicidal thoughts. Cannabis helps alleviate the pain almost immediately.,,,,,,,,,,,

9583,"God no, I've had two spinal surgeries. The first one was due to my accident and I spent 4 days I'm the icu, 3 days in the main hospital and was then transferred to a rehab center where I spent a month in their hospital area doing physical rehab while I healed. Most travel I had to go in for a syrinx  and even then I spent a day post OP in icu and 3 days on the regular floor. Spinal surgery is no joke it hurts like hell and no dance doctor should be pushing you out quickly",,,,,,,,,,,
9584,The procedure op is talking about is totally different. It is no more than a small incision and two wires inserted in the spine.,,,,,,,,,,,

9586,"OP does not actually have a spinal cord injury. They mostly likely had a spinal column injury.Make leg spasms relax, psychedelicsYep. That's spinal cord injury and drugs.

I get a painful sensation when my bladder is full, that hit right at the same time as shit really hit the fan in my brain. I tried once and gave up half way through. While I didn't pee myself, it really detracted from the amazing acid. When I finally came down enough and rolled out to cath it was night and day.",,,,,,,,,,,
9589,"Iâ€™ve had an SCI for 3 years and still like the shrooms, I strap my feet to the footplate and strap my thighs to the chair. Sometimes the spasms get so severe that the front of the chair bounces up and down, miniature wheelies. Just buckle up, youâ€™ll be fine",,,,,,,,,,,

But now its certain and I've been using the chair essentially fulltime for a year, whenever I have to walk I can't pretend I'm not really screwing myself over.

She believes wheelchairs cause you not to be 'healthy' and that herbalism can functionally cure an SCI.I just came out of a month of neuro rehab to deal with some dystonia in my left leg so as to avoid contracture and have joined a gym. Her worries are actually more sociological than psychological, though she believes that you cannot be physically healthy and use a wheelchair.

I know that makes it sound like this is just piling things on, but thatâ€™s not what I mean. Itâ€™s hard to explain. I was paralyzed from the chest down a few months shy of my 14th birthday.

I know the cost can be substantiatal but any amount of money would be worth it to me to have answers and potentially feel better each day.I have been trying my best to stay athletic but it becomes harder every year.

9718,I suppose one of the biggest questions I have is how many surgeries has anyone had for something like this before the found themselves in chair permanently?

Talk to your doctor about the use of these decongestants, they very well could be a factor.",,,,,,,,,,,
9720,Donâ€™t hesitate to call 911 if you canâ€™t identify or quickly correct the cause of AD. Be prepared to tell the operator or ambulance crew what autonomic dysreflexia is and that itâ€™s life-threatening if not corrected. Nitroglycerin paste applied topically can be prescribed to lower your blood pressure to keep you from stoking out until you get the cause resolved.

9723,Decongestants shouldnâ€™t be Triggering it. You should mention it to your doctor because that doesnâ€™t sound normal. Maybe find a different decongestant if it is it cause.  UTIs do cause AD all the time but if you are getting it when you do not have a UTI itâ€™s signs of a greater problem and you should probably talk to your doctor maybe get a CT scan below your level of injury to make sure there arenâ€™t any fractures or other complications that could be triggering it.,,,,,,,,,,,

My guess is what they are really describing when they say this kind of stuff is the person had a spinal injury with no damage to the spinal column.  It happens most often in osteo-degenerative diseases where the bones are fragile and the breaks are not traumatic but can happen ini traumatic injuries too.

After some time I regained function, but it slowly declined over about 5 years and as of now I've been in the chair for about a year. I had intellectually accepted that I was going to be using a wheelchair permanently for a long time. Then, they finally got a clear image of the lesion - something which had been eluding them due to its position - and it hit me emotinally that fuck, this was my life now.",,,,,,,,,,,

I hadn't figured out that I was still kinda holding out hope, that somehow nothing would be found and the assumed spinal lesion wouldn't be there. But it is, and it wont go away. It might get worse, we don't know. I'm still going through the emotional work there.",,,,,,,,,,,
9963,,,,,,,,,,,,
9964,"But, because I know that it'll never go away - and its unlikely I'm ever going to learn my way out I've deliberately got myself involved in positive things.

9977,Thank you very much for your comments. For now I've just put something out there to see what the response would be.,,,,,,,,,,,

9979,**My shared goal -**,,,,,,,,,,,
9980,,,,,,,,,,,,
9981,"Recover from Spinal Cord Injury faster with accessible technologies. Non-reliant on corporate identities, a D.I.Y approach which can stay conceptual until someone has the balls to try it. Or a safer way in directing research being conducted into areas that we want. Some of the research is tampered with as it gets funded by for-profit organizations so be wary that it's a minefield.",,,,,,,,,,,
9982,,,,,,,,,,,,
9983,"**Personally** I wanted to make a lot of money so I could direct my own team and not be limited financially. Because I would trade it all to move again. But seeming as I missed several opportunities to become a millionaire at the age of 17, I might waste the rest of my days trying to take the shortcuts. Already 24 and decided to stop waiting for someone else to come up with the answer to recovering from SCI and do my best to contribute.",,,,,,,,,,,
9984,,,,,,,,,,,,
9985,"I will continue to try and be in a better financial situation, using events and competition. Podcasting as well to distribute/accelerate research via a wider audience but that takes flipping ages to do even one video. And I got about 10 views so not really doing amazing right now but I'm still smiling.",,,,,,,,,,,
9986,,,,,,,,,,,,
9987,"Until then, I'm willing to try and do it without money and make the right connection using text which is faster. Maybe the answer is right in front of us. So I will share the backbone of my podcast topics ahead of time because I'm too slow on my own to get the info out since every topic needs in-depth research.",,,,,,,,,,,

9989,&#x200B;,,,,,,,,,,,
9990,,,,,,,,,,,,
9991,**How can you contribute?**,,,,,,,,,,,
9992,,,,,,,,,,,,
9993,"I came across a lot of pre-existing research that gets lost because there's nobody to read it/understand it. So I could compile a list of areas, from my findings online and IRL. They could possibly be beneficial, but need more looking into. Then its fine for additional input and tangents of where you guys want to go.",,,,,,,,,,,
9994,,,,,,,,,,,,
9995,"Mostly right now, since the brain produces electrical current which triggers nerves. That has got me mostly into that area of recovery. Obviously some people have pacemakers etc and will have to avoid that kind of thing. There are other options that could be used too as well that aren't too invasive.",,,,,,,,,,,
9996,,,,,,,,,,,,
9997,"Since there are many different variations for electrical applications, it takes a large part of the topic. At this point I'm thinking some kind of collaboration document where I could list different areas of research, take input and then allocate topics to individuals.",,,,,,,,,,,
9998,,,,,,,,,,,,
9999,"Sites like researchgate.com, [academia.edu](https://academia.edu) and some non official papers from various sources, old books, alternative websites, youtube channels etc.",,,,,,,,,,,
10000,,,,,,,,,,,,
10001,"The other part is lists of names of people who have already recovered, the methods used and patterns seen linking resolutions together.",,,,,,,,,,,

10003,&#x200B;,,,,,,,,,,,
10004,,,,,,,,,,,,
10005,**Platform ideas?**,,,,,,,,,,,
10006,,,,,,,,,,,,
10007,"As for a collaboration platform to do that, personally I like graphite docs but it lacks features for a bigger group. Maybe it will be Google Docs, but I try to avoid using Google Services with the exception of youtube.. Any suggestions welcome, at the moment I'm familiar with google docs so its no problem even if somebody deletes large sections of useful information, I can find the older revisions easily.",,,,,,,,,,,
10008,,,,,,,,,,,,
10009,"If anybody is still up for, can write up my basic topic areas but it might take me a week to do it? From there once we have the documentation, you can do whatever you want as long with distribution as long as you link back to this reddit post to continue the research process.",,,,,,,,,,,

10048,"I also walk with a cane and 14 years after my injury suddenly started having strong tailbone pain as well. My understanding is that it is because of high resting tone in the pelvic floor muscles, which attach to the tailbone. So when it is under pressure from sitting, it is pulling on a bunch of tight muscle. The intervention that has worked best for me is finding and making cushions that take the pressure off my tailbone.",,,,,,,,,,,
10049,"Your hardware could have come loose or you might need PT or medication adjustment. Best get yourself to a physiatrist, also know as PM&R doctor!

I get looks from little kids a lot, theyre pretty funny.I am a massage therapist currently working at an SCI recovery center. I was just curious about what experiences youâ€™ve had with massage, positive and negative. What made it good? What made it bad? How can I encourage people to feel safe and confident getting on my table?I have been a massage therapist for 15 years and worked with a few SCI clients.",,,,,,,,,,,

10590,"If someone has been injured or is stationary for a long time, it is possible to dislodge a blood clot. Also if they have not been weight bearing for a long time, bone density can be fragile and it is possible to cause damage with range of motion...I knew a guy who's leg was broken that way, so if sensation is limited, palpate very carefully and pay close attention. Signs of a blood clot include swelling, heat and distention distal from the clot. I ask all my clients if they are on blood thinners because that will generally tell you if they've had blood clot issues. In these cases I avoid things that cause venous return like effleurage on medial arms and legs. If someone is pretty active, biking or standing, th",s is a,it le,s of a,concern.,,,,,,,

10593,"Even though the sensation isn't as strong below my injury level, I greatly enjoy having my feet done and my thighs, too (because sometimes they cramp up).",,,,,,,,,,,
10594,"How do people get up onto your table?  Does it move up and down?  That's the problem I've had with massage in the past, the tables have often been too high for me to get onto.",,,,,,,,,,,
10595,,,,,,,,,,,,
10596,I was told by my rehab PT to not get massage on the paralyzed parts of my body (below the waist for me) because of the possible danger of dislodging a blood clot.  Have you heard this?,,,,,,,,,,,
10597,,,,,,,,,,,,
10598,"Massage around the fused parts of my spine have been less enjoyable than the rest of my back; and at the level of my injury, the pulling/friction on the skin can be painful, so oil or lotion is a must.  I always enjoy a lot of arm, should and hand work because I use those parts to push my chair.  Scalp massage is probably my favorite part...SCI is very stressful during the early days, and I find scalp massages to be very relaxing.",,,,,,,,,,,

10607,oh man I could totally use a good shoulder massage,,,,,,,,,,,
10608,I wholeheartedly believe in massage. I started getting them about two years into my injury (I am  about 11 years out now.) I wouldn't have been able to function without them because of how bad my knots were. I went to a regular massage for 8 years going every other week. It helped but I didn't get enough relief for long enough. I started working full time and it got so much worse. At that point I decided to go to a deep tissue massage therapist and it absolutely changed my life. My overall pain was reduced.,,,,,,,,,,,
10609,My personal advice based on my experience is don't feel like you have to be delicate. Every person is different so this might not be good for someone else. I always wanted my first MT to push harder and go deeper. With my current one she does that. I learned that everything is connected and it's not always just where the knot is that needs to be worked on.,,,,,,,,,,,
10610,My DTM was working on me last night and I was telling her I have been getting headaches in one spot at my eyebrow. She said there is a trigger point in my neck that when it gets tight it will cause headaches in that exact spot.,,,,,,,,,,,

He is L1 incomplete, and is having pain mostly in the right side of his middle back. Would you recommend massage therapy for this? Should we try to find someone who really knows what they're doing, maybe a sports massage? Could someone possibly do further damage to a SCI if it was done incorrectly? We're not in the US.

Itâ€™s an investment to your overall health and well being In my eyes. It keeps the tissue healthy and can help to release adhesions in the muscle tissue that can cause aches and pains.

I know that it seems like not picking but in terms of the many systemic effects of a spinal cord injury, nerve root injuries have specific, localized effects just on the areas affected by that nerve plexus (ie your arms and hands). The good news is these nerve root or brachial plexus  injuries have more solutions if they can target the areas where your nerve roots are being compressed than if you had a spinal cord injury. Cortisone May help in the short term to deal with inflammation that may be compressing your nerve roots where they leave the spine, but if they do help Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s the cue to see a surgeon about",ddressi,g the,arthri,is to preserv,yo,r,rach,al,erv,supply,My no

It's going to take time to process this loss, and to figure out how you are going to move forward now that everything looks different and scary.

11219,Personally if I use baclofen with gabapentin it completely melts my spasms. Also I know itâ€™s not a long term or everyday solution but alcohol and other â€œdownersâ€� usually help me out a lot. Have either of those worked for you?,,,,,,,,,,,

11225,I've only ever had issues with some of my toes curling.  My SCI was almost 37 years ago and it hasn't really gotten any worse in the past 15-20 years.,,,,,,,,,,,
11226,Became a quadriplegic in 1991. I was taking the maximum amount of baclofen and valuim  for about a year and my spasms were still pretty bad. Ended up getting a baclofen pump in 1992 and I haven't had spasms since. Life changer for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,
11227,Sadly a pump isn't really an option for me since it isn't available in my country yet.I second this. Medical marijuana is the only thing that's ever helped my spasms it's about 3 years since my injury for me. I have the worst spasms compared to anybody that I've seen in the clinic and fitness centers that I've attended. I was taking 80 mg of baclofen a day. Currently weaning off of it.,,,,,,,,,,,
11228,,,,,,,,,,,,
11229,Unfortunately there's a lot of crap products out there and I tried three different brands of CBD oil that did nothing for me. I still believed in the plant because I know it is medicine so I decided to grow my own. ever since making my own CBD edibles I've been able to actually get a decent amount of sleep.before CBD edibles I would wake up every 30 minutes because of my spasms. Now I can sleep through the night and only wake up when my bladder is full.,,,,,,,,,,,
11230,,,,,,,,,,,,
11231,definitely do your own research. If I were to recommend a brand of CBD oil I would recommend Lazarus naturals. I've read a lot of good things about them plus they give a pretty steep discount for people with disabilities. I believe it is 70% so it's definitely worth a try. If you try something that does not work I would still continue to look four different companies or if you have the means to grow your own. Everybody that I've talked to you that has tried medical marijuana does get some kind of relief from it. Good luck on your journey!

As you probably know, the whole difference between neurogenic pain and regular pain is that is it caused by the injury to your nerves (with you at L1) and not caused by anything at the point where you feel the pain. It is possible in incomplete injuries that sensations get translated into different sensory feelings of pain, but that wouldn't cause permanent pain.

Instead of being able to use calf muscles to help me walk, the plastic AFOs were hindering that. Due to not being used, this caused my calf muscles to completely shrink and atrophy.

I kept trying to push myself back over to the left, but my body kept falling to the right.  It got so bad that I started putting a washcloth between my right side and my arm rest because it was cutting into my side.  I also noticed that I could do this thing where I could kind of push my torso back upright, like re-stacking a jenga tower, and when I did this, I could suddenly breathe more deeply -- along with becoming crooked, I was losing lung capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,

11689,"I went to a local back doctor and demanded an x-ray, saying Something is wrong, this is not just arthritis.  X-ray came back and he says Wow.  Who wants to hear their doctor say Wow?  The bottom of my spinal fusion, done when I got into a car accident that caused my SCI back in 2000, has radically shifted off-kilter from the vertebrae below it, and the two have been grinding each other down to nubs.  Then he says, we could do a fusion, but then the same thing would happen below *that* fusion, sooooo.....here's a back brace, byeee!",,,,,,,,,,,

Official diagnosis: **Charcot spine**.  Charcot (some French guy) means basically that a joint gets all out of whack because it has no sensation and your body can't say Hey! Stop moving like that! so it gets all fucked up.  I have pieces of vertebrae missing because they've just been ground away and absorbed by my body.  I had an area of fluid around my spine that had collected from all this inflammation.",,,,,,,,,,,
11692,,,,,,,,,,,,
11693,"So the only way to avoid this happening again in the future, lower down, is to fuse all of my spine below this Charcot area, all the way down to the pelvis.  I now have not only rods down to my sacrum but also gigantic screws going from the rods into my pelvis.  I now have what is basically a permanent, internal back brace down to my hips.  I can no longer bend at the waist.  I can no longer pick things up off the floor -- I can reach about 4-5 inches above the floor, but that's as low as I go.  I depend on reachers and grabbers now, and will be getting a service dog in the future.  I've lost mobility, but I've also lost pain and gained lung capacity, so yay.",,,,,,,,,,,

11703,,,,,,,,,,,,
11704,"""Charcot spine, also known as neuropathic spinal arthropathy, is a late complication of traumatic spinal cord injury that can produce pain and further disability. We report five cases of Charcot spine occurring in patients with previous traumatic spinal cord injury that we have identified at our institution from 1985 to 1994. All patients had complete paraplegia with levels of neurologic injury ranging from T7 to T12. Common presenting symptoms included back pain, loss of spasticity, change in bladder function, and audible noises with motion. The diagnosis of Charcot spine was made from 6 to 31 years after original spinal cord injury.

It will distract you for a few hours and make you get some good sleep. Also, avoid painkillers and sleeping pills as much as possible. I have spent the last 2-3 years weaning off of them.

However, my right index finger is still too weak to light a lighter, and I still have some numbness. For the first 3 weeks after I feel, I felt intense pressure in my right hand. My fingers went blue every so often, but running hot water over i",turned,it ba,k to f,esh color.,,,,,,,

11863,What are your thoughts?,,,,,,,,,,,
11864,I just read this in a medical journal:,,,,,,,,,,,
11865,,,,,,,,,,,,
11866,>â–ª **From a 34-year-old man with T10 paraplegia:**,,,,,,,,,,,
11867,>,,,,,,,,,,,
11868,">â€œYou know, you'd have to have a complete injury not to feel pain. Not all quads and paras have complete injuries; we do have pain. The worst pain kind of starts like a pressure, like from an overworked muscle. Then it progresses into a burning, like a heat you can't make stop. It gets to the point whereâ€”honestly, docâ€”you don't want to live anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,
11869,,,,,,,,,,,,
11870,"This is EXACTLY how my pain started after than 10 hr plane trip. Then, I felt it again while sitting in class at Univeristy (while I was still well enough to attend class). How significant is this finding to my diagnosis?",,,,,,,,,,,
11871,"I just want to thank you for your continued involvement in my case, despite me being â€œdifficultâ€� initially. I am irritable lately, no motivation, just wanting to sleep all day.... nothing personal.",,,,,,,,,,,
11872,,,,,,,,,,,,
11873,"I actually do have a Lyme Disease dr, and I got tested by the best Lyme Disease lab in the US. Lyme is notorious hard to detect. There are a different number of microbes they test for, which they call â€œbandsâ€�. I had 4 or 5 positive bands, including Borrelia (Lymeâ€™s real name) specific bands. Then, my doctor did a Lumbar puncture and had my CSF tested for Lyme as well. It tested positive. So Iâ€™ve known for awhile (at least 3 years) that Iâ€™ve had this. However, due to the nature of my progression (I get worse when I fall) I figure it HAD to be my back and couldnâ€™t be anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,
11874,,,,,,,,,,,,
11875,"Youâ€™re right man, I need to start listening to my doctors. If I had given up of the cord thing years ago, I could have been having treatment this whole time. Which brings me to what treatment Iâ€™ve had.",,,,,,,,,,,
11876,,,,,,,,,,,,
11877,"The most effective anti-biotic for Lyme (or one of the most) is ceftriaxone. I was treated with a high dose of liquid ceftriaxone daily through a semi-permanent picc line in my neck, which delivered the medication straight to my heart. I was on this treatment for 6 months, and it didnâ€™t do fuck-all.",,,,,,,,,,,
11878,,,,,,,,,,,,
11879,"Then I was sent to an immunologist and my immunoglobulin levels were tested. They were very low (due to Lymeâ€™s attack on my body) and I was put on IVIG. A nurse came to my house every other week and set me up with an IV and delivered IVIG to me. I was on it for 2 years and while it increased my immunoglobulins to normal level, again, it didnâ€™t do anything for my pain.",,,,,,,,,,,
11880,,,,,,,,,,,,
11881,"I also tried the Whals Protocol, which is basically like a paleo-diet, except you have to eat 12 cups of fruits and veggies per day. I was on it for 6 mo tha with no improvements. I did lose all my muscle-mass while in the diet though, so Iâ€™m pretty upset about that.",,,,,,,,,,,
11882,,,,,,,,,,,,
11883,"We also tried Amoxicillin, Tetracycline, Minocycline (which crosses the blood-brain barrier, so itâ€™s more effective than other tetracyclines), but none of it worked.",,,,,,,,,,,
11884,,,,,,,,,,,,
11885,"I was recently taken off IVIG since my symptoms didnâ€™t improve, but Iâ€™m going to fight to get back on it. Iâ€™m going to need everything I can helping my immune system.",,,,,,,,,,,
11886,,,,,,,,,,,,
11887,"My next step is to start those peptides I was telling you about. They apparently dramatically reduce inflammation, so maybe itâ€™s what I need to get better. Iâ€™m also going to make a number of lifestyle changes, including: more supplements, better diet (less carbs + more fruits/veggies), and possibly try and see a world famous Lyme Specialist. My grandfathers pockets are very deep and heâ€™s very generous (along with being one of my best friends). He is willing to pay for any treatment that might work.",,,,,,,,,,,
11888,,,,,,,,,,,,
11889,"I need to get my pain more under control (like you said) so Iâ€™m going to try a ketamine infusion, possibly a spinal cord stimulator, and maybe Celebrex? I do know I need to get the hell off Carbamezapine, because itâ€™s ruining my liver and decreasing the blood levels of my other meds.",,,,,,,,,,,
11890,,,,,,,,,,,,
11891,"I see a neurosurgeon next week, so heâ€™ll be able to tell me more about my back. I see a neurologist the week after that, and Iâ€™m hoping to get a nerve conduction study and an EMG. Hopefully they have some answers.",,,,,,,,,,,
11892,T56 is your problem... Why is your cord being pinched there.,,,,,,,,,,,
11893,,,,,,,,,,,,
11894,You need a lami or lami discectomy,,,,,,,,,,,
11895,Do you have med insurance and what kind,,,,,,,,,,,
11896,"ahh. Ok. Well, I sorta wish it was a tumor so they could just remove it, though Iâ€™m probably simplifying it.",,,,,,,,,,,

If I donâ€™t support enough information, you either: A) can ignore this message, or B) ask more questions. I would really appreciate it. Here it is:",,,,,,,,,,,
11903,,,,,,,,,,,,
11904,Chronic pain:,,,,,,,,,,,
11905,,,,,,,,,,,,
11906,"I am a 32 yr old male that has suffered with chronic pain in every inch of my body since 2013. IÂ burn,Â tingle, quiver - all the classic signs of nerve damage/pain. I feel like I am plugged into a large battery all the time.Â Before I was put on Gabapentin and other nerve/pain meds, I screamed in bed until I was so tired from screaming, I just shivered in my bed. Now, with the enormous amount of meds I am on, itâ€™s a bit better controlled. I was diagnosed withÂ Central Sensitization pain disorderÂ at Cleveland Clinic.",,,,,,,,,,,
11907,,,,,,,,,,,,
11908,"I have no quality of life. I live in my bed, rarely leave the house, walk with a cane, canâ€™t have sex, canâ€™t exercise, canâ€™t go out to eat, canâ€™t stand more than 10 minutes, canâ€™t go to work, canâ€™t drive myself, canâ€™t be driven (while lying on a mattress in the back of a van) more than 30 miles because every little bump in the road feels like a knife in the back, and most anything else a normal 32 year old does.",,,,,,,,,,,
11909,,,,,,,,,,,,
11910,Herniated Disks/Cord Compression:,,,,,,,,,,,
11911,,,,,,,,,,,,
11912,"Mechanically, I have 8 herniated discs and Degenerative Disk Disease, diagnosed by my neurologist (with concurring opinions from at least four other spine/nerve specialists). The diagnosis was based upon contrasted MRIâ€™s of my entire spine and brain.Â Iâ€™ve been in 5 serious and 1 minor car accident (head on collision, 2 rollovers, hit from behind, and hit another car from behind). I also used to power-lift with very, very heavy weights. My MRIs show cord compression in 3 places on my thoracic area, and facet joint changes in my cervical area. However, the neurosurgeons say that it is unlikely the pain is coming from the compression (BULLSHIT) and that surgery wouldnâ€™t help (more BULLSHIT).",,,,,,,,,,,
11913,,,,,,,,,,,,
11914,Sitting Intolerance:,,,,,,,,,,,
11915,,,,,,,,,,,,
11916,"In 2013 after a 10 hr flight in which I had to sit straight up (as you do on a plane), I felt a horribly painful pressure build up in the lower back of my skull. I then felt that pressure spread to my back, arms, and legs. Finally, the burning in my joints (it feels like fire ants inside all my joints) got so extreme that I had tears coming from my eyes. From that day forward, I have not been able to sit upright in a chair without these symptoms reoccurring. I can only sit in a gravity chair. Iâ€™m guessing the cord compression makes it so that a gravity chair puts the least amount of pressure on my discs.",,,,,,,,,,,
11917,,,,,,,,,,,,
11918,Exercise Intolerance:,,,,,,,,,,,
11919,,,,,,,,,,,,
11920,"Any time I put forth ANY physical exertion, my symptoms get horribly worse and I am stuck in bed for days. If it is a fall or an accident, my pain increases permanently (not just a â€œflareâ€�), and my doctors must increase my meds.",,,,,,,,,,,
11921,,,,,,,,,,,,
11922,Standing Intolerance:,,,,,,,,,,,
11923,,,,,,,,,,,,
11924,I can only stand for 10 minutes at a time without my back becoming so painful and weak that it cannot hold my body up. I then have to lay in bed for at least 2 hours before I can try standing again. I also use a cane to walk.,,,,,,,,,,,
11925,,,,,,,,,,,,
11926,High Intracranial Pressure:,,,,,,,,,,,
11927,,,,,,,,,,,,
11928,"I have high intracranial pressure (25 mmHg), tested when I had my last spinal tap.",,,,,,,,,,,
11929,,,,,,,,,,,,
11930,Ergonomic Accommodations:,,,,,,,,,,,
11931,,,,,,,,,,,,
11932,"I can only sleep in MY bed. It took me years to find a bed that I can actually fall asleep in. It is a firm mattress with a 2 inch memory foam topper. I cannot stay with family for the holidays because I can only sleep in my bed. This last Christmas, I drove down south for Christmas (the car ride was horrible), and we had to travel to 4 different family members houses because I couldnâ€™t sleep in any of the beds. I ended up having to knock myself out with 3 sleeping pills per night because the beds causes me so much pain. I also cannot drive myself. My girlfriend drives me around in a mini-van equipped with a mattress in the back on which I lie.Â We can drive for a maximum of 30 miles without me feeling like",eath af,erwar,s.,,,,,,,,
11933,,,,,,,,,,,,
11934,Falls and Loss of Balance:,,,,,,,,,,,
11935,,,,,,,,,,,,
11936,"My balance is so bad, that my occurrence of falls is increasing. This is a symptom of cord compression. On 3/8/19 I fall backwards into my closet, and immediately, my back (the length of my spine) burned badly and was a bit numb. My right thumb, middle, and ring fingers became numb, and I have severe weakness and loss of pain sensation in my right hand. I cannot light a lighter, write legibly, or make a fist without tremendous effort. Since this injury, my fingers and hands turn blue about once a week. When I run hot water over them, it seems to go away. My right leg now also has severe radiculopathy. Every step I take feels like I am dying.

11938,Neurological Lyme Disease & Bartonella:,,,,,,,,,,,
11939,,,,,,,,,,,,
11940,"Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with Neurological Lyme disease (tested from my spinal fluid) andÂ bartonellaÂ by the USâ€™s most premier Lyme disease laboratory, thanks to my brilliant Lyme disease specialist.",,,,,,,,,,,
11941,,,,,,,,,,,,
11942,Autoimmune Disorder:,,,,,,,,,,,
11943,,,,,,,,,,,,
11944,"Iâ€™ve also been diagnosed with CVID (Common Variable Immune Deficiency) by my Immunologist, for which I receive biweekly IVIG infusions).Â He did a blood work up, and several markers in my Immunoglobulin Panel were very low.",,,,,,,,,,,
11945,,,,,,,,,,,,
11946,POTS (Dysautonomia):,,,,,,,,,,,
11947,,,,,,,,,,,,
11948,"My heart is constantly pounding, which I originally attributed toÂ anxietyÂ until I was diagnosed with POTS (PosturalÂ OrthostaticÂ Tachycardia Syndrome) with a â€œtilt-table testâ€� at the Cleveland Clinic. I also have shortness of breath pretty regularly - to the point where I have to stop what Iâ€™m doing, catch my breath for about a minute, then proceed to speak. It feels like Iâ€™m having panic attacks 24/7, originating in my chest and pulling on all the muscles around it. I find that when I bathe in a hot bath or hot tub, my muscles become so relaxed that my pain decreases noticeably. Iâ€™ve had severe, severe anxiety my entire life. However, that still does not explain all my other diagnoses. POTS is a",ype of,ysaut,nomia.,Dysautonomia,ay,e,ue t,sp,nal,cord in,ury.
11949,,,,,,,,,,,,
11950,High Blood Pressure:,,,,,,,,,,,
11951,,,,,,,,,,,,
11952,"I also have high blood pressure, for which I take 3 bp medications. Even on all these meds, my bp is still elevated. I was also found to have high intracranial pressure, for which I take a deuteric. The intracranial pressure causes nerve pain on my face/top of head, and the deuteric seems to help that pain.",,,,,,,,,,,
11953,Â ,,,,,,,,,,,
11954,Low Vascularity:,,,,,,,,,,,
11955,,,,,,,,,,,,
11956,"Before I got sick, I was very vascular. It was even commented on, several times, while giving blood on different occasions that my veins were vascular and easy to find a vein to take blood from. Since Iâ€™ve gotten sick, my nurses comment how hard it is to find a good vein, and in many occasions they collapse my vein and need to try a new one.",,,,,,,,,,,
11957,Â ,,,,,,,,,,,
11958,Blurry Vision:,,,,,,,,,,,
11959,,,,,,,,,,,,
11960,"MyÂ eyesightÂ is getting worse. No one in my family under the age of 45 has ever needed glasses. Iâ€™ve had to get 3 new prescriptions in the last 2 years, and my vision is still getting worse. I was diagnosed withÂ Map-Dot-Fingerprint Dystrophy at the Cleveland Clinic.",,,,,,,,,,,

11962,Hearing Loss:,,,,,,,,,,,
11963,,,,,,,,,,,,
11964,"My hearing is going in one ear and it â€œpopsâ€� in the other ear. I was diagnosed with premature hearing loss at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio.",,,,,,,,,,,
11965,,,,,,,,,,,,
11966,Treatments Tried:,,,,,,,,,,,
11967,,,,,,,,,,,,
11968,"For the Lyme disease, Iâ€™ve tried months of intensive antibiotic treatments (through a picc-line in my neck), intense diets, supplements, cleanses, and heavy metal chelation. For the pain, I've tried myriads of pain/nerve medications, steroid injections, Botox injections, nerve ablations, physical and water therapy, chiropractors (made it worse), massages, acupuncture, psychological therapy to help reduce the pain, TENS units (they help a bit), a pain pump (helps more than oral meds), and more. The meds help to a degree, but my doctors are constantly having to increase the dose (due to pain increase, NOT due to tolerance of the opiates).

12140,,,,,,,,,,,,
12141,>â–ª **From a 34-year-old man with T10 paraplegia:**,,,,,,,,,,,
12142,"â€œYou know, you'd have to have a complete injury not to feel pain. Not all quads and paras have complete injuries; we do have pain. The worst pain kind of starts like a pressure, like from an overworked muscle. Then it progresses into a burning, like a heat you can't make stop. It gets to the point whereâ€”honestly, docâ€”you don't want to live anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,
12143,,,,,,,,,,,,
12144,"This is EXACTLY how my pain started after than 10 hr plane trip. Then, I felt it again while sitting in class at Univeristy (while I was still well enough to attend class). How significant is this finding to my diagnosis?Sorry to hear you are in this position.  I'm a physical therapist so cannot comment on the medical management of your condition.  If it has stumped 5 neurosurgeons than I've got no chance of figuring it out.",,,,,,,,,,,
12145,,,,,,,,,,,,
12146,&#x200B;,,,,,,,,,,,
12147,,,,,,,,,,,,
12148,There are a few things I can comment on:,,,,,,,,,,,
12149,,,,,,,,,,,,
12150,"\- the surgeons all appear to agree you are not appropriate for surgery, therefore conservative management is your only option",,,,,,,,,,,
12151,,,,,,,,,,,,
12152,"\- prolonged sitting and lack of movement is only contributing to your problem.  You said yourself, physical therapy was working until you sat for 10 hours on a flight.  Sitting is one of the worst things you can do because of increased compression forces on the spine.",,,,,,,,,,,
12153,,,,,,,,,,,,
12154,\- lack of movement is bad for spinal health,,,,,,,,,,,
12155,,,,,,,,,,,,
12156,&#x200B;,,,,,,,,,,,
12157,,,,,,,,,,,,
12158,"I suggest you look to get your pain under control to a level where you can revisit the idea of physical therapy.  The only way you can manage this is through movement as surgical intervention is not a possibility.  On a positive note, a good portion of your current pain is likely due to your very sedentary lifestyle and the likely bad postural habits you've adopted.  If you took a healthy adult and gave them your lifestyle habits it is almost guaranteed they would develop back/neck pain and some level of radiculopathy.",,,,,,,,,,,
12159,,,,,,,,,,,,
12160,&#x200B;,,,,,,,,,,,
12161,,,,,,,,,,,,
12162,&#x200B;,,,,,,,,,,,
12163,,,,,,,,,,,,
12164,"is your pain/weakness more one sided? Same in arms as in legs?  your pattern of pain and weakness can help diagnose where the problem is coming from and whether it is a central of nerve root compression.Disclaimer: I am just a random guy with internet access who has attended  few classes on medical topics while getting an engineering degree, and an interest in neurological topics due to my own disease.",,,,,,,,,,,
12165,,,,,,,,,,,,
12166,,,,,,,,,,,,
12167,"With that taken care of, here are my thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,
12168,,,,,,,,,,,,
12169,"> Iâ€™ve had EVERY test you can think of, and have been diagnosed with a shit ton of disorders, but nothing neurodegenerative.",,,,,,,,,,,
12170,,,,,,,,,,,,
12171,Hm. The description of the symptoms and the progression in flare-ups sounded similar to MS at first. Or maybe an as of yet unknown genetic disorder that results in demyelination?,,,,,,,,,,,
12172,,,,,,,,,,,,
12173,,,,,,,,,,,,
12174,"You wrote that you are diagnosed with Lyme's disease. That is a fairly nasty condition all by itself and could alone be the cause of many, if not all of the symptoms.",,,,,,,,,,,
12175,,,,,,,,,,,,
12176,,,,,,,,,,,,
12177,Stupid question: Did they do a brain MRI while they were at it?,,,,,,,,,,,
12178,,,,,,,,,,,,
12179,,,,,,,,,,,,
12180,"Since you're already on a truckload of anti-seizure meds, the symptoms being attributable to seizures is probably unlikely.",,,,,,,,,,,
12181,,,,,,,,,,,,
12182,,,,,,,,,,,,
12183,> My CK levels were fine.,,,,,,,,,,,
12184,,,,,,,,,,,,
12185,,,,,,,,,,,,
12186,"As far as I know, CK tests for muscular injury, muscular degeneration, or various forms of muscular dystrophy. The latter results in the direct destruction of muscle cells and is not a disease of the nervous system, even though the end result - paralysis - is often associated with neurological disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,
12187,,,,,,,,,,,,
12188,,,,,,,,,,,,
12189,> MYELOMELACIA. That is a scary disorder. Basically a death sentence.,,,,,,,,,,,
12190,,,,,,,,,,,,
12191,"Hm, hadn't heard of that. It sounds like it can be caused by multiple traumatic injuries/contusions of the spinal cord. It may not be a death sentence, but the severe cases will put the patient on a ventilator for good in addition to near-complete paralysis. Sounds nasty.",,,,,,,,,,,
12192,,,,,,,,,,,,
12193,,,,,,,,,,,,
12194,> My balance is getting worse and worse (which is common in cases of cord compression) and so I fall more often now.,,,,,,,,,,,
12195,,,,,,,,,,,,
12196,,,,,,,,,,,,
12197,"Spinal cord damage or irritation should not affect the sense of balance itself, but motor function impairment and proprioceptive sense impairment can lead to falls.",,,,,,,,,,,
12198,,,,,,,,,,,,
12199,,,,,,,,,,,,
12200,"> My fingers went blue every so often, but running hot water over it turned it back to flesh color.",,,,,,,,,,,
12201,,,,,,,,,,,,
12202,"Sounds like vasospasm (uncontrolled, spasm-like constriction of the blood vessels). Lyme's disease can cause this, but it can also be caused by lots of other things and even occur by itself without a discernible cause.",,,,,,,,,,,

12207,"Yes, I have very good insurance. It's Florida Blue (BCBS \[BlueOptions PPO\]), but it allows me to use it out of state as long as you accept BCBS. I can only imagine it was the acute trauma of all the car crashes I've been in that's compressing my cord. I also have neurological lyme disease, which is causing system wide inflammation, possibly compressing the cord even further.",,,,,,,,,,,
12208,,,,,,,,,,,,
12209,">At T5-6, there is a focal 4 mm central disc protrusion which compresses the ventral spinal cord and is unchanged. There is an unchanged area of increased T2 signal in the cord which may represent myelomalacia (image 18, series 14).",,,,,,,,,,,

12216,,,,,,,,,,,,
12217,"Why just T5-T6? Don't these other ones state that they compress the cord as well (T7-T8 & T9-T10 use the terminology ""abuts"" and T10-T11 says ""effaces"" so I'm not sure). Also, why would a thoracic compression be causing these neurological symptoms all over my body? Literally, head to toe. My Dr. told me that thoracic compression can cause system-wide neurological issues, but the people on this thread are making me doubt it a bit. Anyways, if my Neurosurgeon that I'm seeing this week decides not to perform surgery, I'd like to maybe come and see you.I donâ€™t even have an external cd drive.

12221,Thank you for taking the time to help me out. This one looks amazing. Perfect for what I'm looking forThat first one is actually the one I've been looking at on Amazon. That second one though has the tilt table front part which would help alot because my brother does have a lap table of sorts that goes over his lap and he angles it up against the cheaper type of table he has now so his keyboard is more at a 35-45 degree angle. Thank you for taking the time to look into it and help me outFeeling in my legs sortaSounds like youâ€™re cord wasnâ€™t completely severed allowing some but not all nerve activity.

12223,I can feel a catheter being inserted. It also causes a tingling at the bottom of my left foot once itâ€™s fully inserted for some reason. I canâ€™t move a muscle in my legs (besides involuntary spasms) but I can enjoy a massage and feel pain.,,,,,,,,,,,
12224,> I was wondering if I can get some backup on this,,,,,,,,,,,

12226,"Presence or absence of sensory information could be shown by doing a sensory evoked potentials test. Roughly speaking, this involves periodically stimulating some part of the body with small electric shocks and measuring an EEG at the same time. If any sensory information reaches the brain, this can be seen on the EEG.",,,,,,,,,,,
12227,,,,,,,,,,,,
12228,"Usually, this test is done in order to test for demyelinating processes, which will increase the time it takes for the stimulus to reach the brain, but I assume the procedure would also show if the stimulus reaches the brain or not.",,,,,,,,,,,
12229,C6 here.,,,,,,,,,,,
12230,,,,,,,,,,,,
12231,"Don't know of the catheter part, but I also could somehow ""sense"" the position of my feet and legs. But when I asked my dad to poke my lower extremities with his finger & with a needle, while eyes closed, I can't feel anything. So, I believe it's just false sensation of phantom limb for me.",,,,,,,,,,,
12232,,,,,,,,,,,,
12233,"Maybe you could do a test by yourself, to confirm whether it's just phantom limb sensation.",,,,,,,,,,,
12234,It seems really weird your doctors would deny that if they know youâ€™re incomplete.,,,,,,,,,,,
12235,,,,,,,,,,,,
12236,Iâ€™m incomplete and get loads of different sensation below the level of my injury.,,,,,,,,,,,
12237,"My level is t5 incomplete as of '97. I had trouble communicating the different sensations early on due to my age and what little I managed to explain was dismissed. I was basically told I could feel nothing below my chest and that was that. Anything to suggest otherwise was just nerve pain, apparently.",,,,,,,,,,,
12238,,,,,,,,,,,,
12239,"Since getting older and listening to my body, I have learnt that the dismissed sensations are actually perfectly valid. From knowing when I need to use the toilet to having somthing digging into my leg, being able to enjoy a sex life and finding shoes uncomfortable.. I've concluded that without actually experiencing life with a spinal cord injury, not even the best doctor can fully understand what is going on so you don't need their acknowledgement to validate your experience, just listen to your body :)",,,,,,,,,,,

The ASIA assessment is the gold standard for assessing SCI. ASIA is one of the affiliated societies of the International Spinal Cord Society.The exam is based on neurological responses, touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome, and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body.
