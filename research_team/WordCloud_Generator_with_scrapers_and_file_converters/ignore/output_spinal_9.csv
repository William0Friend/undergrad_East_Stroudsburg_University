Spinal Cord Injury: Facts And Statistics You Should Know,27,0,,False,jqvwgz,gbq09ll,"Sounds right, wish I was in the majority that only had an incomplete injury. Also my first year cost after my accident was around $750k which is absolutely absurd."
Spinal Cord Injury: Facts And Statistics You Should Know,27,0,,False,jqvwgz,gbqmvgi,I was only compensated with 50k
Spinal Cord Injury: Facts And Statistics You Should Know,27,0,,False,jqvwgz,gbr5yp6,"So tell me why I was denied disability twice. I'm getting ready for my 3rd round with them. My first surgery to correct issues with arthritis left me unable to walk for about 5 months in 2013. I regained my ability to walk but I still have issues from the waist down. Everything from numbness to severe pain. They just went back in 3 months ago because my new doctor diagnosed me with kyphosis. He cleaned out scar tissue and fixed a bulging disc where I had my first surgery and installed 2 rods to support a spinal fusion. I had a CT scan today because I was still in a lot of pain and they found 2 loose screws in my L2 vertebra. 

I've been saved from completely losing my ability to walk twice and I'm grateful that the doctors were able to do that for me. But screw the government for telling me that someone would hire me in my condition. I have to much work experience which means there are a lot of jobs they seem to think I can do. I've stopped typing this out 3 times so far to adjust myself because I'm in pain. I can't even fall asleep without taking a bunch of pills. Spinal injuries are being treated just like mental health in a lot of cases. I have issues with both and neither of them get the attention they need."
Spinal Cord Injury: Facts And Statistics You Should Know,27,0,,False,jqvwgz,gbqe0rp,"I didn’t even have a traumatic injury, and spent a total of exactly 11 days in the hospital spinal unit after surgery due to complications. That number just hit me personally."
Has anyone else been treated by doctors like your injury is no big deal and the damage sustained while waiting for a diagnosis was just par for the course?,6,0,,False,jr2e4n,gbqxbqh,"D4, D5 incomplete with a skull fracture. Was taken to a hospital first, then had to go to another one because the surgeon at the wasn't available for a day.

At the second hospital skull fracture was immediately taken care of but my spine only got operated on after 2 days (I think). I have no memory of the accident and many days after. Got all this from family members. I'm from India btw..."
Has anyone else been treated by doctors like your injury is no big deal and the damage sustained while waiting for a diagnosis was just par for the course?,6,0,,False,jr2e4n,gbr0nlm,"C5/6 incomplete with a skull fracture. I had similar situation to the earlier comment. 16yrs old at the of injury. Taken to kids hospital but too old to be treated. Taken to another to have scans. Taken to another to spend time on a ward before I was transported to a spinal care ward 70 miles away where I was given ALOT better treatment. I can’t remember which of the first 2 hospitals it was but I spent the night in agony as my feet had severe pins and needle and I just needed them rubbed so the pain went away. Was ignored till my parents arrived in the morning, think the nurse must’ve quit after the telling off my mum gave her"
C3-C7 Spine Tumor,2,0,,False,jr29ye,gbqtv79,It sounds like you may have arachnoiditis- search doctor Forest Tennant on google.
Colostomy complications need advice,1,0,,False,jqwgx7,gbqy8lm,"Is her colostomy productive ( putting out stool)? I’d recommend some radiology studies to make sure she doesn’t have a blockage from twisting or adhesions/scar tissue. Since the colostomy is temporally related to her AD, I’d investigate that first."
Exercise in water?,0,0,,False,jqv5gd,gbpieth,It helped me when I was in hospital. The resistance of the water is a good starting point. As it’s buoyant and if you fall you just float
Exercise in water?,0,0,,False,jqv5gd,gbpug66,"I saw significant gains from exercising in water.   There are a wide range of activities, techniques and underwater equipment that can be performed/used that are super helpful."
Is stretching a non-functioning limb important?,3,0,,False,jqp2u8,gbolys0,"Absolutely! I’m a t5 Para and For me stretching helps both spasms and nerve pain a ton. Another good way that stretches your heel cord/Achilles etc is the standing frame. Which is also good for circulation and clot prevention. 
I get on the floor and stretch every other day or so.  Both butterfly stretches and my Achilles/calf. Careful with butterfly stretches I tire my groin once pushing to hard lol. Which would be easy not having stretches them in years."
Is stretching a non-functioning limb important?,3,0,,False,jqp2u8,gbokz4t,"Yes! His OT/PT should’ve recommended this after the injury! I’d definitely recommend he see one ASAP, as the years of not stretching can lead to things like clots or tendon tightness that requires surgery. When I stretch my legs even though I’m no longer truly paralyzed anymore, they shake violently because they’re so used to not being used much. It’s a sign that my husband and I aren’t doing enough to stretch them/move around."
Is stretching a non-functioning limb important?,3,0,,False,jqp2u8,gbon6xc,"Also if you want the perspective of helping here is one. Gives step by step instructions. 
Although I’m an advocate for doing everything you can yourself.

Is stretching a non-functioning limb important?,3,0,,False,jqp2u8,gbpepud,"Absolutely: as someone who didn't do this for several decades (you know how it is with kids and being lazy), your joints start locking up because the tendons get super tight. My hips and knees can't extend beyond ~120 degrees anymore, and this is after having gotten surgery once already as a kid for the same issue :/"
