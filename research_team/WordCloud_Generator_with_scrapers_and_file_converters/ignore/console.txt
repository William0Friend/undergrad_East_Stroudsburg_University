Comment Body:Sounds like it could be scoliosis. Sometimes a brace can help, but they can also be a pain.

Comment Body:Going from my quickie to this is literally life changing. The ergo seating helps with balance in the chair so much. It’s literally like I went from a mini van to a sports car.  With ergo seating the seat bar is bent.

Comment Body:D4, D5 incomplete with a skull fracture. Was taken to a hospital first, then had to go to another one because the surgeon at the wasn't available for a day.

At the second hospital skull fracture was immediately taken care of but my spine only got operated on after 2 days (I think). I have no memory of the accident and many days after. Got all this from family members. I'm from India btw...

Comment Body:C1 C5/6 incomplete nontraumatic and for sure, I think for my neuro its about not catastrophsing the injury and freaking me out. I wasn't even told I was up at C1 until I "made sufficent progress towards stability" and was told "high spinal cord injury" for a long time. Getting told that was kinda nuts, as I'd previously thought C2 from people not telling me exactly where and my own research.

I'm not sure how typical my experience is though, as my first year being quad is also covid year so.

Comment Body:C5/6 incomplete with a skull fracture. I had similar situation to the earlier comment. 16yrs old at the of injury. Taken to kids hospital but too old to be treated. Taken to another to have scans. Taken to another to spend time on a ward before I was transported to a spinal care ward 70 miles away where I was given ALOT better treatment. I can’t remember which of the first 2 hospitals it was but I spent the night in agony as my feet had severe pins and needle and I just needed them rubbed so the pain went away. Was ignored till my parents arrived in the morning, think the nurse must’ve quit after the telling off my mum gave her

Comment Body:I wish I would have waited. I had an accident in a country with mediocre health care. I was operated on by 'best spinal surgeon' in the country. She told my family that I would have no nerve damage whatsoever. On the plane back home I started losing consciousness and had to make an emergency landing. The did a CT scan and there were pieces of bone in my spinal cord that were missed by the surgeon. Had to stay at the hospital over the weekend because there was no weekend transport possible... Then when I got to the hospital in my home country, I was rushed into surgery to remove the rest. Pieces of bone stuck in my spinal cord for 5 days longer than needed.

Comment Body:Sounds right, wish I was in the majority that only had an incomplete injury. Also my first year cost after my accident was around $750k which is absolutely absurd.

Comment Body:So tell me why I was denied disability twice. I'm getting ready for my 3rd round with them. My first surgery to correct issues with arthritis left me unable to walk for about 5 months in 2013. I regained my ability to walk but I still have issues from the waist down. Everything from numbness to severe pain. They just went back in 3 months ago because my new doctor diagnosed me with kyphosis. He cleaned out scar tissue and fixed a bulging disc where I had my first surgery and installed 2 rods to support a spinal fusion. I had a CT scan today because I was still in a lot of pain and they found 2 loose screws in my L2 vertebra. 

I've been saved from completely losing my ability to walk twice and I'm grateful that the doctors were able to do that for me. But screw the government for telling me that someone would hire me in my condition. I have to much work experience which means there are a lot of jobs they seem to think I can do. I've stopped typing this out 3 times so far to adjust myself because I'm in pain. I can't even fall asleep without taking a bunch of pills. Spinal injuries are being treated just like mental health in a lot of cases. I have issues with both and neither of them get the attention they need.

Comment Body:I didn’t even have a traumatic injury, and spent a total of exactly 11 days in the hospital spinal unit after surgery due to complications. That number just hit me personally.
