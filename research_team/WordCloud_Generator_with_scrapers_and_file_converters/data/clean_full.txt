URGENT  I need someone to answer this questionHonestly smoking will shorten your life more than your spinal cord will I know people who ve had their spinal cord injuries for 40  years and one woman who has had hers for 63 years  Hey Asher it depends on the severity of your SCI There are some that say the injuries at the C vertebrae can be risky for someones life if you dont have the right treatment Im a T7 complete so it doesnt really affect my breathing muscles too much But smoking  cigarettes   will shorten your life more than any SCI Smoke weed instead    But you can message me anytime you want   Hi Asher You asked for something based on statistics Here s a study cited nearly 1000 times   https   www archives pmr org article S0003 9993 99 90252 6 pdf  All I did was Google  spinal cord injury mortality statistics  if you want more  I have a friend in his early 60s who became quadriplegic in his late teens   still living a full and productive life as CEO of a Non Government Organisation  Been married for many years  since before I met him and I have known him for nearly 30 years   Asher you should live until at least 60 unless you get an infection Eat lots of protein stay away from sugar and carbs and keep yourself active You don t just want long life but you want good quality of life  Well I m 50 and have been in a wheelchair From a car accident  c6 incomplete quad  since I was 16 and still going strong Smoking isn t the best thing for you especially with a spinal cord injury as it reduces blood flow to major organs and you want to keep your kidneys healthy Renal failure along with heart disease and Respiratory illness are our major downfalls Stay active positive and live as healthy as you can and you will live a long as most ABs do   Edit  hit me up if you have any questions Hey Asher I hope you got some helpful answers  In my experience of which I also have a type dwarfism similar to Peter Dinklage you will hear a lot of  expertise   on these things from people who read an article online from who knows what   I bring up my dwarfism because long before I had my SCI going back to grade school people told me  dwarfs  have shorter lifespans  just like I still sometimes run into Of course it s not based in any kind of reality Only someone thinking they knew something they don t   The same can be said for SCI You can see even in this small thread in a small subreddit there are multiple examples of people living perfectly average lifespans Don t let people scare you with their falsehoods I m sure they ll cite some article somewhere but I guarantee they didn t understand it or missed something whatever it may be   You have a lot of time ahead and there s so much you re going to do  I hope this helped a little     it may seem odd but that is the actual grammatically correct plural version of dwarf as opposed to  dwarves  which is what s used in fantasy novels like The Hobbit etc but in reality is not what s used   Hard to say you didn t list your level or asia score I have had a couple friends die young because of blood clots and know some that are in their 70s You will last longer than you think   Medical technology is accelerating fast   no spinal cures   but every other complication will have therapies solutions  Yeah the smoking will kill you or mess with your chances Try some breathing exercises instead of tobacco  420 is ok but try water bong or baking it Please stay away from tobacco cigarettes You should last long if you drink lots of water every day make sure you watch out for pressure sores try eating veggies I m just really anxious could I message youAnd sometimes a person wants to hear from someone in the same situation and not from what other people have wrote I tried reading that it s not working for my brainUpgrade Got a new TiLite titanium chair with ergo seating For anyone getting a new manual chair anytime soon check it out Splurged on the color package and the tattoo engraving Going from my quickie to this is literally life changing The ergo seating helps with balance in the chair so much It s literally like I went from a mini van to a sports car  With ergo seating the seat bar is bent  This is a very nice looking ride The difference a quality char makes is mind blowing  Sweet ride here s my latest set of wheels  https   imgur com gallery 1POgY I m on my 1st chair  Quickie Helium  and this looks cool as all hell Will keep TiLite in mind for the future  Man I wish I could afford some sort of chair other than what Medicade has given me that thing hurts my back and constantly is breaking because the rubber comes off of the wheel I m Jelly That looks so amazing Enjoy your new ride  That s a slick looking chair Love the blue spokes  Sweet ride Cool color combo Love my ZRA I have pretty much the same chair just without the ergo seating but the same blue and blue spokes I just got the titanium push rims best chair I ever had  I have the same Spinergy wheels  Which model did you have previously For the record I m going the opposite way round Moving to what you ve got We went with the dual tube cuz I literally snapped my quickie frame in half above the caster Has anyone else been treated by doctors like your injury is no big deal and the damage sustained while waiting for a diagnosis was just par for the course C1 C5 6 incomplete nontraumatic and for sure I think for my neuro its about not catastrophsing the injury and freaking me out I wasn t even told I was up at C1 until I  made sufficent progress towards stability  and was told  high spinal cord injury  for a long time Getting told that was kinda nuts as I d previously thought C2 from people not telling me exactly where and my own research   I m not sure how typical my experience is though as my first year being quad is also covid year so  C5 6 incomplete with a skull fracture I had similar situation to the earlier comment 16yrs old at the of injury Taken to kids hospital but too old to be treated Taken to another to have scans Taken to another to spend time on a ward before I was transported to a spinal care ward 70 miles away where I was given ALOT better treatment I can t remember which of the first 2 hospitals it was but I spent the night in agony as my feet had severe pins and needle and I just needed them rubbed so the pain went away Was ignored till my parents arrived in the morning think the nurse must ve quit after the telling off my mum gave her I wish I would have waited I had an accident in a country with mediocre health care I was operated on by  best spinal surgeon  in the country She told my family that I would have no nerve damage whatsoever On the plane back home I started losing consciousness and had to make an emergency landing The did a CT scan and there were pieces of bone in my spinal cord that were missed by the surgeon Had to stay at the hospital over the weekend because there was no weekend transport possible  Then when I got to the hospital in my home country I was rushed into surgery to remove the rest Pieces of bone stuck in my spinal cord for 5 days longer than needed  D4 D5 incomplete with a skull fracture Was taken to a hospital first then had to go to another one because the surgeon at the wasn t available for a day   At the second hospital skull fracture was immediately taken care of but my spine only got operated on after 2 days  I think  I have no memory of the accident and many days after Got all this from family members I m from India btw   How are you doing I m a similar situation as you C2 C5 6 My first year being a quad is also during covid Have you had any recovery I m not familiar with D as a vertebrae level Is that cervical neck Spinal Cord Injury  Facts And Statistics You Should KnowSounds right wish I was in the majority that only had an incomplete injury Also my first year cost after my accident was around  750k which is absolutely absurd  I was only compensated with 50k So tell me why I was denied disability twice I m getting ready for my 3rd round with them My first surgery to correct issues with arthritis left me unable to walk for about 5 months in 2013 I regained my ability to walk but I still have issues from the waist down Everything from numbness to severe pain They just went back in 3 months ago because my new doctor diagnosed me with kyphosis He cleaned out scar tissue and fixed a bulging disc where I had my first surgery and installed 2 rods to support a spinal fusion I had a CT scan today because I was still in a lot of pain and they found 2 loose screws in my L2 vertebra   I ve been saved from completely losing my ability to walk twice and I m grateful that the doctors were able to do that for me But screw the government for telling me that someone would hire me in my condition I have to much work experience which means there are a lot of jobs they seem to think I can do I ve stopped typing this out 3 times so far to adjust myself because I m in pain I can t even fall asleep without taking a bunch of pills Spinal injuries are being treated just like mental health in a lot of cases I have issues with both and neither of them get the attention they need  I didn t even have a traumatic injury and spent a total of exactly 11 days in the hospital spinal unit after surgery due to complications That number just hit me personally  These rehab numbers are hilarious compared to Europe Rehabilitation is often for over 12 months Granted this is a very slow and ineffective and honestly passive treatment compare to what I ve heard of in the US 23 hours a day in bed  one hour of physiotherapy Poor nutrition  You say  only an incomplete  yet you can have an incomplete damage by definition and be just as bad off as someone with a complete injury Just saying   Same ish here at least in the same order of magnitude Should we be speaking with personal injury attorneys You got this my friend It s only a number now A distant memory I spent 4 days in ICU after my reconstructive surgery and another 7 in step down before a month in the ward and then 5 months at in patient rehab Those first 11 days were definitely wild but looking at how far I ve come  Cant discount anything that s happened Long shot torso stability questionSounds like it could be scoliosis Sometimes a brace can help but they can also be a pain  Lumbar Decompression BeltC3 C7 Spine TumorEveryone I know who has an incomplete injury has daily pain Mind bending to be sure myself included My friends with complete injuries have spasms but don t feel it I guess what I m getting at is anyway you slice it there are a whole lot of negative issues to deal with But I try to stay positive or rather more positive by understanding that no matter how bad you got it someone has it way worse So do what you can to deal with it then put a little more mental work in and finish it through It s NOT easy but the first hurdle of being alive is behind you You ll not always be able to be out in front of the pain or your situation but like any loss in your life it ll get a little easier as you go Be safe and get better Cheers It sounds like you may have arachnoiditis  search doctor Forest Tennant on google  That word is making me think of a deformed spider THE STINGING Colostomy complications need adviceIs her colostomy productive   putting out stool  I d recommend some radiology studies to make sure she doesn t have a blockage from twisting or adhesions scar tissue Since the colostomy is temporally related to her AD I d investigate that first  Thank you She has had no output since yesterday morning She is post surgery two weeks I really appreciate your response Exercise in water It helped me when I was in hospital The resistance of the water is a good starting point As it s buoyant and if you fall you just float I saw significant gains from exercising in water  There are a wide range of activities techniques and underwater equipment that can be performed used that are super helpful  Even when I was in rehab 15 years ago we did PT in the pool  They had water dumbbells that were basically just floaty dumbbells  Even just swimming with your arms is good exercise with low impact on stuff like your rotator cuffs etc  also it was a nice change from the monotony of the rehab gym lol Okay that s good to know Thank you   That s great to know Thank you   Okay that s good to know Thank youIs stretching a non functioning limb important Absolutely I m a t5 Para and For me stretching helps both spasms and nerve pain a ton Another good way that stretches your heel cord Achilles etc is the standing frame Which is also good for circulation and clot prevention  I get on the floor and stretch every other day or so  Both butterfly stretches and my Achilles calf Careful with butterfly stretches I tire my groin once pushing to hard lol Which would be easy not having stretches them in years  Yes His OT PT should ve recommended this after the injury I d definitely recommend he see one ASAP as the years of not stretching can lead to things like clots or tendon tightness that requires surgery When I stretch my legs even though I m no longer truly paralyzed anymore they shake violently because they re so used to not being used much It s a sign that my husband and I aren t doing enough to stretch them move around  Also if you want the perspective of helping here is one Gives step by step instructions  Although I m an advocate for doing everything you can yourself   https   www sportsrec com 491527 stretching exercises for paraplegic spasms html  I Absolutely  as someone who didn t do this for several decades  you know how it is with kids and being lazy  your joints start locking up because the tendons get super tight My hips and knees can t extend beyond  120 degrees anymore and this is after having gotten surgery once already as a kid for the same issue    Thank you He is a veteran and from what I ve seen of his care it hasn t been the best but also he doesn t always advocate for himself I had a hard time understanding google whether it meant SCI who were working towards mobility vs don t have mobility

CjwKCAiAqJn9BRB0EiwAJ1SztVGWYa9QHFRUSlthsckb2H1ig6Pim2abrvgQ2eX5fSYzmHNeLjGfAxoC3eEQAvD_BwE   I recommend these   these are called bogs They are freaking amazing   no zippers   no laces   just two handles and slide They are tall and neoprene insulated   neoprene is what scuba divers use to keep their bodies warm in water   so how it works is it traps your temperature and does not release it  Freaking brilliant  They are tall so stuff your pants inside and you re good to go They are rated to  40 Degree weather I have had the same pair for three years And they still look new  they are amazing and resilient    Have you looked at Chacos  I just got a fleece lined pair of boots there that I like  I recommend the high top vans mountain sneaker They re easy to throw on and will keep your feet toasty and stylish They re called the Vans Ultrarange Hi top  Get them a size or two bigger  Slip on running shoes would perfect They are very flexible and it takes seconds to put them on without twisting your toes I ve stopped wearing my other footwear since I got them   Here s a link to something that looks similar to mine https   www skechers com men shoes elite flex   karnell 232048 html My feet changed after years of sitting and I have a hard time putting on my Doc Marten Mary Jane shoes They re just for special occasion now I wear converse all the time now because they open wider and just fit my foot better I wear over the knee or thigh high socks in the winter for warmth I do live in California and it doesn t get super cold I ve also taken butchers broom in the past it is an herb that is supposed to encourage blood flow in the lower extremities so that might be a consideration If your feet haven t changed and you love your Docs maybe get a size too big for the winter and invest in some thick ass socks  I went through SO many shoes until I got my leg braces just trying to find a pair that I could easily put on and off I m at S1 so I have full use of my arms but lacing and unlacing shoes boots gets old My mother in law gave me a pair of her old winter boots that she purposely bought like 6 sizes too big so she could wear fluffy socks inside Turns out that leg braces or not I can get into those things easy and they have a drawstring at the top that I just pull to keep them on For less cold days I actually bought these short suede winter boots from Walmart for like  10 and they work I just made sure to but a size 11 even though I m a size 9 5 to accommodate for when I wear my braces  I like the style You have flaccid legs feet and are able to get them into these boots easily I use high top vans all the time   mountain sneaker is probably gonna be my go to this winter Baclofen users  Do you get anxious if you miss a dose or two Yes for sure  If myself or my wife miss our nightly dose  we don t take high amounts 20mg for me 40 for her  we get what we describe as the gitters Definitely an anxious internal shaky feeling which doesn t allow us to sleep I ve been on baclofen for 20  years started at a higher dose but as the years went on the spasms got less so I weaned myself down Even on 20mg I get those anxious times when I miss one dose  It took the baclofen a few weeks before it finally started working for me but I definitely feel a noticeable difference in anxiety and am more prone to spasms when the nurses are late with my meds  I was taking a near lethal does of baclofen daily I kicked it though I don t know how you guys do it  Hmm haven t really missed any doses yet maybe once  take every 8 hours  but never noticed anxiety Did notice a huge difference in my spasms though so that lead to me never missing doses  I stopped taking baclofen since it doesn t work on me I was od ing over the summer with 120mg doses at once because my spasms were so frustrating and throwing me out of my chair I now take CBD and THC with 2 pills of Zanaflex at night THC causes me lots of anxiety so I can only have max 5mg   but it doesn t help with my spasms the day over which is nice I can never keep my right leg straight or it ll spasms immediately So I m always cross legged I might get the baclofen pump since my spasms are so bad and interfere with my daily life and work focus  Yes I m on 20mg and feel exactly the same It s like impending sense of doom but with anxiety emotions instead Not fun So glad I m not alone though   Cannabis fixes my regular anxiety but it only amplifies baclofen based anxiety A real kicker to figure that one out the hard way I feel so relieved that it s not in my head It s distinctly with baclofen I don t remember if I took my baclofen last night and I forgot this morning By noon time I was feeling anxiety I couldn t resolve I feel better about an hour since taking the baclofen  the anxiety resolved when the spasms did too    I wish I could control my spasms without withdrawal side effects   What do you mean by this I m glad you kicked the habit I m more ashamed that I am on baclofen daily than I am to be on cannabis daily   It s a dirty habit that makes me feel like I m craving some hardcore shit of stuff I don t even like Valium is more recreational to me if we are being honest   Sorry I got sidetracked Anyways how d you get off it Thankfully I m only on 40mg total daily but it still sucks So incredibly stumped with these two quiz questions I m turning to the internet as my last hope   IS ANYBODY HERE A PLUMBER    Question 1   You obviously know that different parts of the spinal cord carry different  services  so we are looking for which part of the cord carries motor services to the right side  weakness in R leg  and which part carries pain and temperature from the left side  pain and temp L leg  but accepting that the part that carries vibration   proprioception is apparently unaffected   This image you may have seen before  https   imgur com TTXjihi  Anterior cord is at the bottom of this image so we are looking for the part of the cord that carries motor on one side and part of the cord that carries pain and temp on the other  Anterior right side and lateral for the left seems correct to me  Proprioception being intact would tend to exclude a posterior lesion  Question 2   Pain and temperature sensation are part of the afferent neurological pathways and are closest to the ventral horn in the spinal cord  See previous image   I would select ventral horn bilaterally for this    Edit and I would probably be wrong  See other comments  1  I feel like there s no perfect answer to the first question if I had to pick the best answer it s 17C it s Brown Sequard syndrome with sparing of the dorsal columns The R leg weakness  R corticospinal tract  the L temperature and pain sensation impairment  L spinothalamic tract which decusates  crosses to the other side R side of the spinal cord before innervating the peripheral limb  Thus the lesion is in the R hemicord but spares the posterior aspect  https   i imgur com 4QuuSlz jpg 2  21B   this is dermatomal sensation loss sensory comes from dorsal root ganglion https   i imgur com 2rDBpCZ jpg No but I can use a plunger pretty well from a seated position An odd question but do you think pain from the left side it s transmitted autonomically to the right Ventral cord would knock out the specific level that s affected and everything inferior to that This seems to be just localized to the waist I m thinking it s more DRG Thoughts Legs aching Man that sux I m not a complete so can really give you a good comparison But i suspect your right about it being nerve pain related Hope it gets better soon Maybe try shifting positions  sounds kinda like nerve pain to me I don t know you or what solution is best but I have to suggest this first   Start doing a daily stretching routine 30 mins On the floor Every day  Do that for a month and see how you feel  How long have you been injured I m incomplete and experience leg pain from poor circulation so maybe that could have something to do with it Not trying to be offensive because I have no idea how different your sensation is but just a suggestion  Hope you feel better though  I have similar sensations Not a lot I can do about it   I felt it was at its worst early on  presumably muscle pain from atrophy   Perhaps try stretching massage cold hot water and other experiments to see what works  Sucks dude I get that when my seat gel needs adjusting I ve been sitting too long or my sciatic nerve is unhappy I always check my seat for hard spots first with some pressure relief dips If it s still there I then lay down for 30 minutes or a nap  I just schedule this at 2pm everyday now  Hey T5 6 complete here 12 years out I also have this feeling and it s gotten worse over the past year Sometimes my thigh feels like it s being twisted underneath my skin   Recently my neurologist started me on pregabalin and it s helped a lot They ve also suggested an Open Rhizotomy   It s really annoying and I m sorry you re going through this too T5 complete here I get this same exact thing Feels like a wicked Charlie horse   I m pretty sure its just nerve pain Happens frequently  Oh yeah I have constantly it fucking blows lmao   good luck i haven t found anything to deal with it It sounds like nerve pain to me When I take CBD THC my legs are on fire for a few hours I was complete inpatient for a five months before transitioning and what you described sounds like a mix between nerve pain and maybe some areas of partial preservation firing back towards your brain   I ve been shifting and stretching all day I think it s related to spasticity and I m just going to have to get a baclofen pump soon It s been about 2 and a half years it might be circulation but I m not sure Thanks it seems to be pretty much gone today I was on pregabalin and gabapentin but they made it incredibly hard to think so I had to stop I think I ve narrowed it down to poor circulation legs being cold or some kind of irritation along the injury line that mimics the pain Just had my surgery for cervical myelopathyAh that reminds me of my operation I was told I spent most of the 8 hours in a sitting forward leaning position and I was unable to leave the hospital bed due to muscle pain   Warm baths helped but the healing process first needs to allow for that  Question about Bladder Medication and or Condom CathetersHas your so been to a urologist I mean if it s been three years then things can change and a urinalysis and perhaps a cystoscopy would be beneficial for urinary tract health   There could be a stone Leakage means higher pressure and constant high pressure or high pressure in general can cause problems further down the road  I recommend talking to a urologist about the medication oxybutynin I take 15mg per day  10mg morning 5mg night  and no longer have problems with bladder spasms   Per  Wikipedia  https   en wikipedia org wiki Oxybutynin    Oxybutynin sold under the brand name Ditropan is a medication used to treat overactive bladder In 2017 it was the 100th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than seven million prescriptions  Ok I have a lot of experience with this   So first of all the primary purpose of a condom catheter is for a individual who would not be intermittently cathing You are probably right that if your SO was applying and removing one say 5 times a day skin would break down I used condom caths for the majority of the day for around 4 years I stopped because in the last year I was experiencing UTI s 2 3 times a month   I saw a urologist who recommended medication but it was not effective for me but do know some who have benefited greatly from medication I m not sure I understand what you mean by  natural flushing    My recommendation is Botox injections in the bladder This has been a miracle cure for me I used to have  leaks  multiple times a day but now I never have any and I can go long hours without cathing Again my urologist recommended this to me after medication wasn t successful  I am a T 6 incomplete Asia A B and I use condom catheters every night with a bag as I can t hold my bladder past  250 300ml During the day I find myself selfcathing every 3 4 hours as accidents can be common for me I would say as long as you use the protective skin wipes with the condom catheter  acts as a barrier between the condom and the skin to prevent any damage  and don t keep the condom catheter on for more than 8 10 hours at a time letting the skin breathe during the day you should be completely fine I personally don t like the idea of Botox just yet as I don t want to do anything permanent to my body with the hope that my recovery will keep gradually improving   Worst case scenario you do have some minor irritation in the skin there are protective barrier healing creams that are extremely helpful in taking care of it  making sure it doesn t get worse Hope that helps answer your question Best of luck to you and your boyfriend  Aside for recommending oxybutynin tolterodine Botox did nothing for me Has he considered a suprapubic catheter I don t suffer from UTIs perhaps I m lucky  Definitely going to avoid Botox He has a few friends with the same build and injury who had it done Both of them had issues where it spread to the rest of their muscles and they couldn t transfer anymore One of them had to stop driving for a few months until it wore off enough     Def didn t have time to read all the posts So sry if I said something that s been said lol I had a problem with UTIs for a long time  Till I had a brilliant general pract Doc that I was seeing at the time put me on a daily sulfamethoxazole I ve gone 2 years between UTIs at times now  Yeah getting urodynamics would be key His last visit was right before the virus shut everything down Unfortunately his insurance cut their contract with his urologist at the same time That s also when the spasms started  Bad timing I know   I think I m going to remove the word leakage from the main post  He doesn t have issues with dribbling His bladder will visibly swell up he gets the sudden urge to pee and I have about 45 seconds to get a handheld urinal in place before his bladder empties If we cath right after there s usually between 0 100ml left inside   We re making an appointment someplace new this week Just want to see if anyone has been in the same boat and if there s anything we should be asking the new urologist that we haven t thought of yet   Thank you we ll definitely ask about a cystoscopy This is what I d recommend and this is very popular in the UK If not they are on Tolterodine XL   Oxybutynin    Oxybutynin sold as under the brand names Ditropan among others is a medication used to treat overactive bladder It works similar to tolterodine While used for bed wetting in children evidence to support this use is poor Thanks for the insight about condom caths it answered a lot of questions for us   We re going to give medication a shot u Attaboy3 mentioned that we shouldn t have issues if he decides to come off of them during a future UTI   He s had a few major  fever chills etc   UTI s since his injury and was only taking antibiotics if they were bad  as advised by his doctors  but we ve been warned about the damage antibiotics can do to the body if you take them too often He got two of them back to back right as the pandemic flared up and  peed  for the first time while we were trying to decide whether this was ER worthy   I don t know how else to put it but his body responded really well to the  natural flushing  of his urethra He doesn t have urethral pain anymore and no major UTI s since it started happening It kinda makes sense to us and this is just a guess that if the infection is in the urethra it will never have a chance to heal if the only thing that touches it is a catheter pushing on it Peeing is usually the body s first response to a UTI Could be wrong though Do you think it would be possible to sleep on your stomach with a condom catheter   Edit  Also thank you for the insight This is kind of the system we could see us following if we decide to go the condom catheter route We feel the same way about Botox and supra pubic wanting to explore less invasive options first We ve thought about it but we ve heard that people can t sleep on their bellies with them Something about how it s difficult to position and drain  Not sure if that s true for everyone  The only way he can get a good night s rest is on his stomach and he s afraid a supra could compromise that That sounds extremely concerning  it shouldn t spread that much at all It s a very localised injection normally Are they talking about bladder Botox Woah daily antibiotics  That s wild Incomplete SCI  4 months ago T2 T3 fracture T4 burst fracture broke my hip in 3 places including and open book fracture dislocated my right knee tearing my acl and pcl all from some guy illegally merging onto oncoming traffic while I was riding my motorcycle Today I can walk with crutches AMADamn son you sound just like me A little over 2 years ago I was riding my motorcycle and decided to take the intestate home just joyrideing at night Well the lady in front of me got confused as to what exit to take so she slammed on her breaks and I hit her I had a sci all my ribs were cracked or broken bladder ruptured and my pelvis broke in three places I couldn t do rehab for several months due to an external fixator holding my pelvis together I haven t regained anything yet so it s not likely to happen sadly but good on you for getting back up  What was your return like What did you get back first What was is your rehab like  Motorcycle injuries suck I hope your recovery works out well Burst fractures hurt like a bitch and it s a long road back Keep at it keep up your physio and most importantly of all take that fucker that hit you for everything you can get Best of luck man  What kind of bike where you riding  Congratulations recovering so quickly Do you have any anger issues towards the other driver Has your attitude helped or hindered your recovery  Congrats and keep killing it from a fellow incomplete sci patient Thx for sharing your story and progress Your attitude appears to me to be amazing I m a L1 burst fracture from a m c accident caused by someone else and everyone seems to want me to be full of rage but I feel it s counter productive My positivity keeps me in P T and pushes me to get back to walking Thx again  I m t2 t3 incomplete as well 18 months and still nothing Best of luck  Yea man I had an external fixatir on my leg for two months shit sucks man First thing that came back lower body was my quads and my left leg came back pretty fast I was in inpatient rehab for like 3 almost 4 monthsThanks bro My back hurts almost all day no hip pain shockinglyNinja 300No anger whatsoever toward the driver I think a positive attitude helps alot cause it allows you to go harder during therapyFa sho man I may be disabled but I ain t no quitterLooking for examples of better accessibility Id like to make my own tiny home I used to hike with my best friend I m sad I don t get to sit at the top of secluded mountains anymore with her  Hi Qwert one of our bloggers looked into Accessible Tiny Homes a couple years ago and found 5 examples she also included links to the builders in the article We didn t really get into cost budget but it s a start  https   www spinalcord com blog 5 amazing wheelchair accessible tiny homes  https   www spinalcord com blog 5 amazing wheelchair accessible tiny homes Suprapubic pt IIthe suprapubic catheter should essentially drain based on gravity so you need to ensure your collection bag is below the bladder Your kidneys aren t involved in the process besides from creating urine and passing it to the bladder through the ureters  I also have a suprapubic catheter While I do find my drainage is based on positioning as long as I make sure the tubing is all downhill I can drain just fine while sleeping on my back without any manipulation I initially had some issues with clogging but switching to a larger catheter size resolved that Perhaps that could also help your situation Best of luck to you in finding a solution  I ve had a SPC for around 25 years now it s a good thing Try using a night drain bottle that sits on the floor  I sit mine in a bucket in case it overflows  about 10 minutes after lying down I move the tube around a bit till I can hear the urine dripping flowing and then it s set for the night   If traveling I use a bag and bag holder attached to the side of the bed or a chair etc so it s below bladder level  See how u go  I feel like there could be a number of different things to try here but some additional info would be helpful What size catheter are you using and what volume is the balloon in the end What type of drainage bags are you using  leg bag bedside  If using a leg bag are you using extension tubing or connecting it directly to the catheter Are you using a garter or tape to keep it strapped to your leg  Whole Body Spasticity    Going Foetal  Incomplete C4 C5You can do this  I know you can  Peace friend Any updates  I m praying for you  You matter   Xoxo  Your friend I have gone back to the foam wedge   It stops me turning in the night   A bit of hip pain but manageable   I am getting a muscle relaxant Tiznadine   Also I may buy leg straighteners   They are the things physiotherapists use for knee dislocations   They lock the leg straight   Just an idea  is anyone else here done with thisI ve definitely felt like that before you certainly not alone in that I m also 10  years in and have at times cursed my painful over and over  wondering what the fucking point is   It s not fucking easy   It does pass through Those feelings will not always be so intense Our bodies suck a lot of the time and in my case it s thanks to Neuropathy pain If you have it you know how awful and relentless it can be  Thing is there are some small stretches of relief and distraction that happen Sometimes they come out of nowhere but mostly we have to work at making the good happen It does happen though   We got a shit deal with our situations but we can still have good quality lives  Ours just happen to have a lot of physical and or mental pain at times For me I have to remind myself that I can still do many things that a lot people with more severe situations cannot Not just SCI but a myriad of other issues I know that people tell you to think of that all the time and it can feel like it s dismissing your own situation I just mean for myself without comparing I try to remember to try doing something I can do to get my mind occupied on something else   Anyway I just wanted to say yeah I definitely go through that sometimes I hear ya man Try to distract yourself  I know it can seem impossible but I promise this feeling will pass  Yeah I really miss the days when I would wake up and feel good No back pain no excess tiredness no stomach bladder or bowel issues I keep going out of the feeling like I have to because I can t just quit but fuck this shit is so much extra  Yup I just got out of a week in ICU because of a UTI that went septic and caused me to have a heart attack I am barely 30 If my arms weren t completely useless I would ve put a bullet through my head a long time ago  Often I have felt this way when I have been suffering with an infection Might be worth checking your blood work it can really drag you down to those extra low levels   If you can think of projects or something to focus on in the future and look forward to that s the stuff that keeps me going Otherwise you can just be stuck in the same repetitive Groundhog Day situation and that doesn t help anyone  I now have vibrations along my nerves unless I am walking or standing or if I m in a specific contorted position I can lay down If I try to sleep while they are vibrating I lose feeling in my body parts and it takes longer to get the vibrations to stop I can sleep for 2 to 5 hrs at a time Of course like all of my symptoms this is  not possible  and no one else has ever had these symptoms My family Dr does not want to hear about my issues as there is nothing she can do so I must wait for the neurologist to reopen Could be a year from now I will be out of money by the end of the month If I don t fix myself somehow on no sleep and living with a narcissist I will be  what Living in a parking lot walking around my car in circles because I can t sit or lay down I wake up wondering if I should just get rid of my cats plants hopes   dreams and just die If these vibrations become permanent I will be killing myself Until then I ll just keep trying to be positive and pull myself the fuck out of this I am so tired  Dude yes you re not alone my friend   All my closest friends are

was being battered by the waves and drowning I heard God s voice   couldn t get my beautiful wife s face out of my head I decided I wanted to live and started swimming back I barely made it back to shore and called 911   I m now at my family s house and am SO glad I decided not to go through with it I made a vision board with goals and am now working towards those goals If you can be around people as much as possible It s terrible to isolate By myself I was in a pain negativity feedback loop I m seeing a psychologist and it s helping a lot Make sure you re evaluate your meds and make sure youre not taking any you don t need I am an addict so I have to be very careful with my meds I have my wife dispense them to me   I love you no matter who you are We are warriors The pain we go

that confirms my suspicions   How to deal with my nerve pain Gabapentin aka Neurontin 1800mg bid Lyrica didn t do the trick for me either  I use medical marijuana meditation and ibuprofen Medical marijuana for me does not alleviate the pain in fact initially it makes it worse but once I crest over that painful period the pain is dulled pretty well  i ve had lyrica and neurotin they didn t work  Medical cannabis has been the only thing that actually kills the pain  A 1 to 1 ratio of thc cbd seems to work best for me  Certain strains work better than other but they all work better than the only 2 pharmaceutical solutions that are out there I did gabapentin and pregabalin they worked but I realized they were also messing with my ability to think I ended up stopping all pain meds it sucked for a bit but I was able to get used to it Now I don t have much issues with nerve pain until I lay in bed to sleep and then it will flair up So at night I use a heating pad to help it go away but it doesn t always work It sounds like your nerve pain is worse than mine but this was my experience  Marijuana is great for nerve pain and pain in general   Those pill meds that was given to me to treat nerve pain had to many side effects for me  I use Topomax with Lyrica it s helped  Maybe ask your doc about it  Ice baths if super cold showers and doing whatever movement k can seem to help me Medicine  gabapentin  I took gabapentin and it didn t work Now I take amitriptyline and I do medical marijuana as well Typically 10 mg edibles every day towards the end of the day so I can get shit done without getting high all the time Not to bash anyone in this group because people are able to function well on marijuana A physical therapist of mine also told me I need to stretch the parts of my body where I m experiencing nerve pain That did work A little bit but most of it is psychological and not going anywhere  I use Diclofenac cream   Lidocaine creams   patches Thst us the only way I can function I go broke buying it I m on Lyrica too it does help but lately it hasn t been as much I m looking into these desensstizing things online It kind of makes sense somewhat because after my showera   I use my hand shower to scrub off the old creams I ALWAYS have so much less pain for a couple of hours afterwards  Either 30 500 co codamol or a spiked roller bar I m trying to get off the pain meds entirely but this is the lowest I could get down to and still be functional  I agree you slowly build up the dose It was a life changer for me All the best have you tried different strains and ways to ingest  vape smoke edibles topicals transdermal patches and lotions   A 1 to 1 thc cbd edible works best for my nerve pain and usually kills all the pain  Also certain strains work better than others  Some make it less painful and then some completely eradicate my painDid you have any negative effects from lyrica I did a thing to protect my car from my wheelchairthis has always been an issue but I ve never thought of anything to do to stop or mitigate it  I like this idea but idk if I d do it myself  I ve thought of the 3m scratch protection film but I still feel like it would eat through that and eventually scratch the paint  But cool idea homie  Great idea  Man I do not miss transfer boards one iota Great idea   Thanks for sharing   Thanks yeah I didn t think the film would be a long term solution so I came up with this I have a better idea for one but I would have to purpose build it from scratch For those of you who have experimented with Ketamine LSD and hopefully from quads is experience is generally positive or negative Noting that the experiences from here of mushrooms seems to be quite negative regarding spasticityI had ketamine for my flap surgery and waking up from it in the waiting room was one of the loveliest things I ve felt like waking up swaddled as an infant However I would be worried about self dosing and my addictive personality   I loved tripping before my injury however now with the length of LSD I have to cath mid trip which is like impossible for me and leads to a bad time on the two occasions I have tried it post injury I thought about a foley but as I never wear one I didn t want to bug out and rip it out mid trip   I have yet to hear one bad review of DMT although I have not tried it myself For any hallucongin please make sure you are in a good set and setting which means a comfortable physical and mental place   I just stick to the sticky icky these days I haven t tried ketamine or LSD but as a C6 incomplete I don t have spasticity issues on mushrooms Molly was awful for spasticity though  I have tried LSD pre and post accident and the spasticity is extremely intense  I have a lot of tone and spasticity anyways but this was on another level Be ready to deal with that I found sitting cross legged helped with it somewhat LSD is still LSD though it can be a beautiful experience or it can be really difficult but it s usually what you need As another person said make sure you are in a positive space and positive mindset I hope you really enjoy your experiences  L1 para here I have done 6 ketamine infusions and while expensive I had experiences that I will try to never forget I d implode anyone that does experience psychedelics to write down those feelings the next day and look back on them  Baclofen pump users are they worth it I have had the pump almost 30 years I ve never really been self conscious about how the pump looks Even when I had the old thick ones that made it look like I swallowed a hockey puck so I can t say much for that All I Know is that it works great for me I was on the max oral baclofen and valium before the pump and hated it Now I don t even think about spasms The only downsides for me is getting it replaced every 5 to 6 years but even that is not that big of a deal anymore I get mine refilled every 7 to 8 weeks  I have a complete injury at T2 T3 I fought spasms for 8 years before finally deciding to have the pump implanted It makes a HUGE difference in my QoL It s not really noticeable under clothes and hasn t changed the way I move or anything like that The side effects of baclofen are now non existant for me Plus I m not taking Tizanadine as well So yeah totally worth it  I have 1 Ived had it 4 5 yrs At one time I wanted it out but couldn t deal with the side effects of coming down  I dislike it sticking out my side as well  At first I purposely gained weight to cover it up but now that I work out a lot it hard to hide it I m a t11 incomplete   I spasm a whole lot but I don t like moving up or down   Pump may or may not change your bladder spasticity You could get higher doses for botox more often Or switch to a different medicine without as many side effects  although they re not going to be quite as effected as oxybutynin   Following this thread I have some of these same questions  What type of doctor did you talk to about getting one I m assuming a neurologist Really fucked up my spine with nitrous oxide Yeah inhalants are bad for you Sorry you re going through this Best of luck with your rehab  Wow that s crazy Thanks for sharing and good luck in your recovery   As someone with chronically low B12 and gets injections I ve heard that nitrous oxide use drains the B12 in your body Knowing that I m wondering if you have peripheral neuropathy from an extreme B12 deficiency   since very low B12 can cause neurological damage  Oddly enough I remember the smell of nitrous oxide from just before my spinal cord surgery The anesthesiologist used it to induce general anesthesia   It smelled sweet and just seconds later the lights went out for almost nine hours   I know this isn t in the spirit of the sub but this post makes me angry Here I am a person that was careful their entire life and due to a freak accident I am permanently paralyzed I m reading a post from a guy that did too many whip its I don t have any will toward OP but it s hard for me to empathize with someone like this  Im sorry you re in this predicament I hope you feel better soon  3   But just saying as a general statement to everyone that N2O is pretty safe and not unhealthy to use occasionally  Oh most definitely I m either totally with it or out of it like I just came out of a seizure It affected my brain more than I d like to admit I m leaving this up because  u Jeiku53 is handling it great and maybe you ll learn something but this isn t the way to talk to someone who is coming here for support I get where you re coming from but this happened due to my own stupidity and I fully accept that It doesn t mean I still don t have an injury and that I m recovering from it Yeah the paralysis in my body is only temporary 4 6 weeks before I m at about 50   but I posted this for peoples medical curiosity not for sympathy empathy or even support You shouldn t be angry at addicts for ruining their lives we do it to ourselves But if I can try and make the most of my recovery positive and spreading the word of what happens with nitrous oxide addictions maybe it might influence someone to not buy that next box of whipits As someone who went from occasionally using N2O to someone fully addicted I d say the only appropriate use or time for it is from medical professionals If people want to use them recreationally they have to be extremely cautious of the addictive and long term damaging properties of N2O I want others to learn from my mistakes not test how far they go before they get to the point I m at I knew but chose to ignore due to an extremely depressive slump but telling others it s safe at all for recreational purposes is something I ll never do again Neurogenic bladder and bladder cancer  Handy article   https   craighospital org resources bladder cancer     tl dr risks are for folks with in dwelling catheters not folks who IC and appear to be linked to irritation from the balloon  Honestly what is the point of knowing the exact number I m not trying to be snippy    I just mean that as people with relatively severe disabilities we all know that we re at increased risk of certain medical conditions and diseases depending on our disabilities  The only thing we can do about it is to keep ourselves informed about how to keep ourselves healthy    in the case of taking care of our bladders we need to drink water maintain clean cathing techniques and get ourselves checked out by urologists in a timely manner  We can also ask each other about tips and tricks we ve found that work to keep down infections   Remember just because people with your disability have X increased risk for Y disease doesn t mean you re for sure going to get it  And part of having a disability  part of the human condition really  is accepting the fact that you can only control what happens to your body to a certain extent  You gotta get zen about it man because life is going to take its course none of us live forever and in the meantime the only thing we can do is take care of ourselves    and each other    the best we can  I looked it up for SCI and it looks to be somewhere around 6  but it depends on how they did the study etc Smoking cigarettes makes the risk go higher Do you have a urologist If not you probably should They should be the ones to give you a better answer and then do cancer screening  urine tests and also looking at the bladder through a scope   Reminder  Kidney failure used to be the most common way people with SCIs died     Another catheter related risk that has been suggested is a factor called the  era of care   Some physicians believe that people most at risk are those who were injured long ago before modern antibiotics anticholinergic drugs and catheters made from safer non rubber materials were available Some even believe that bladder cancer incidence rates will be lower among more recently injured SCI survivors who are treated with today s more modern methods I m a HUGE hypochondriac and I saw that and I freaked out I m also afraid of doctors  Yes I have a urologist since I was little at CHOP  children s hospital of Philadelphia  she s been my urologist since I was little and it made sense for me just to stay there instead of going to another adult hospitalConstant constipation causing stomach painHave you tried Miralax Fiber What s your fluid intake like  Drink 2 3 liters of water every day Eat food with high fiber content  avoid over consumption of highly processed foods If you need to supplement your fiber intake with Psylium husk Exercise is also helpful  Eat fiber rich foods I had the same issue as a complete got really backed up to the point I had to go to the er  They tried giving me drugs for it laxatives and what not  The thing that fixed it all was counting my fiber intake Look it up but men should eat around 30g of fiber a day and women around 25g I think  Along with drinking enough water like someone else said  You can also supplement with metamucil but focusing on having a fiber rich diet has worked for me  I m a complete but after I got injured I was always on and off being constipated I maintain regulatory by drinking Metamucil daily and having a bowl of raisin bran daily as well Also I use bisacodyl suppositories if I start to feel constipated  I m a complete but after I got injured I was always on and off being constipated I maintain regulatory by drinking Metamucil daily and having a bowl of raisin bran daily as well Also I use bisacodyl suppositories if I start to feel constipated  Even if like me you have

you live your insurance company and in all likelihood your lawyer   WC covered modifications to my parent s house over a decade ago  I was 18 when I was injured   They also covered minor modifications to the apartments I ve lived in but they ve been fairly accessible to begin with I m looking for a home to purchase now and I m expecting them to modify that as needed Because it will be a long term living situation I believe they ll be willing to modify more than what they did to my parent s house   This is based on conversations with my lawyer claims adjuster the OT who managed the original modifications and friends from the local NSCIA chapter I don t yet have personal experience with the second major renovation so I m curious to hear what others have to say and hope it confirms what I ve heard before   I would definitely recommend reaching out to your local chapter for advice from people who have experienced the reality in your area  I have never heard of insurance covering a second home In fact workmen s comp might cover home renovation but afaik private insurance doesn t I have never heard of private insurance covering home modifications at all let alone more than once  Worker s compensation will cover but it s limited and I ve not heard of them covering more than once  Medicaid will cover mods but I m pretty sure that s pretty rigidly as needed and time limited like DME replacements  brace recommendationDepends on where you do and don t have strength Leg braces can just be for the ankle joint  AFO  or can be more extensive including the knee  KAFO  Having the ability to move without your wheelchair would be great for situations where it s not accessible for your chair Do you think you ll be able to do some stairs  I get a lot of advertisements for the C Brace on social media I don t think I have the hip strength for it yet and I have no idea whether you can get it covered under insurance but still considering asking my PT about it  i can do some stairs with one crutch on one side and holding on the rail on the other side but i am focusing on normal walking at the moment     the specialist there told me that he doesn t want to interrupt my training and that i just should go on for the moment i received some stabilisation for my ankle but i m not sure if i really need it maybe my hopes were too high so i just keep going   yea i saw that one as well would be great to have one of course but i think for me even something less high tech could do the job and yes i think its quite expensive about 75k from what i ve heard     do you walk with crutches as well because i can walk with crutches quite good and i don t really put much pressure on them but without i do not have stability so maybe also the hip needs to be improved Does anybody wear a back brace to improve your posture I ve thought about it but I think it would be uncomfortable in my chair I haven t tried it though  I have a baja brace someone gave me I try to use it here and there Sometimes it helps for a few mins Mostly it just pushes my pants off my ass I work a physical labor job with a laundry list of lower back issues Im wide awake at 3  00AM hoping a couple shots of rum will give me some relief to sleep until I need to wake up and work so take my advice lightly I guess  I didn t have the best posture before getting hurt so I ve been worried about it affecting my future wellness I ve also had increased nerve and leg spasms since becoming more active My lower back hurts a bit cause it compensates for lack of muscle strength elsewhere So I got a store bought Velcro back support and I find it does keep help with posture in and out of the chair without any discomfort and IMO it relieves the back pain by isolating the muscles I ve I ve worn it to bed on occasion and didn t have any discomfort But like many of us with SCI  we are constantly diagnosing ourselves and trying to figure out what works or doesn t work Good luck Hey I found this through your  fuck smoke detectors  post   I used to wear a low support back brace okayed by my physio It helped but what helped more was getting a better backrest I had the slingback support as standard and for years just thought that was all I needed   Eventually bought a solid backrest privately again after running it by physio The difference is incredible and I wish I d done it years ago Mine is a Tarta which are hideously expensive I got mine second hand and that saved a lot It compensates for one shoulder being lower than the other and gives very customisable contour support I m female and have a 10  difference between waist and hips so standard contour backs didn t work for me Someone who is male or doesn t have such an odd ratio will probably be fine with a more standard solid back   It has cut half an hour out of my physio every day because I m not constantly working out the side effects of my poor posture What I would suggest is to always run it by your physio or chair OT and to be aware of your cushion if you change it I use a J2 as my standard cushion with the large fluid pad for pressure relief For exercise I have  uhhh I m not sure I think a Jay Active Anyway it s lower so I m closer to the wheels for consistent hard pushes Those three inches make a massive difference  that s what she said  to the backrest fit and have to be compensated for if you do anything similar  I have a carbon fiber backrest and if I add just a little bit of lumbar support with some sort of cushioning or just chopping the top two inches off my posture would be greatly improved 30 M   Possible congenital stenosis Severe foraminal herniation apparently What am I up against here I was diagnosed with severe cervical and lumbar congenital stenosis It s moderate in the

compression over the years screwed up my nerves so I have pretty bad spasticity I m in some kind of pain or discomfort daily My neck has been fused for 10 years now My last lumbar surgery was in 2016 The damage in that area caused my bladder to stop worrying correctly I also got a terrible case of PEs after that surgery and almost died in the ICU   I too went through the ringer with tests I had terrible joint pain in my hands wrists feet and ankles Lots of other things No one could figure it out for years until one day I woke up and my arms and legs were numb I couldn t hold anything it barely walk After my doctor saw the MRI he sent me right to the ER   The truth is that it s very difficult Surgery is so painful especially in the posterior cervical area Recovery sucks Even daily living is exhausting some days But the alternative is so much worse I m able to work play with my kids exercise etc Basically live a somewhat normal life I m also pretty young with potentially 30 40 years left if all goes well but that s also a long time to have to maintain   You ultimately have to listen to your doctor and decide for yourself but there is a light It won t be easy but I d what you have to do Life goes on and you be able to enjoy it   Good luck  So not a Doctor so take what I say with a gain of salt   Your MRI scan looks very similar to mine I has a mtb crash and suffered an SCI but at the location of my SCI C6 7 I had stenosis which confused the Doc s as to whether it was an old injury with a new one on top of it  Anyway I had C6 7 disk fused and am on the mend  life will never be the same as pre crash but I m a he ll of a lot better of than if I did not have the surgery in my humble opinion  Not a doctor no SCI   Do have ME CFS  20yrs  with high EBV and scoliosis  around T4 6  Pain if I sit unsupported and I too drape myself over a foam roller every night to until stuff cracks more or less into place   I don t have a lot of neurological symptoms mainly temperature regulation issues  tmi but I don t sweat so overheat fast in summer and am equally bad with cold weather Thought I was just weird until I complained to a friend with a SCI who said he had this too    There have been quite a few people who got tested for CCI AAI after Jen Brea from the Unrest movie was diagnosed and treated for that  C0 C1 fusion    It fixed most of her CFS symptoms No more Post Exertional Malaise for one  She also had had tethered cord so is not completely symptom free and then she got covid19 as well      I think there is a Functional Mechanical Facebook group  name should be similar to this if I messed it up  where you can learn more about this Surgery is considered  last resort  for CCI AAI but in short  yes it seems like neck  upper cervical issues can cause contribute to CFS symptoms More research is needed  what else is new   Desensitizing nerve painHave you tried gabapentin My nerve pain shows up by making the tops of my feet feel like they re on fire But it s under control with gabapentin I don t know what you mean by desensitizing nerve pain but I have been able to use estim nmes to kind of trigger my nerves into behaving normally so that my nerve pain is greatly reduced in those areas  Sort of by accident I use a hard spiked roller on my legs when nerve pain plays up with them seems to work for a while and then fade Over the last short while doing that I haven t noted much change in the regularity of the nerve pain but I guess we ll see  i ve tried lyrica and gabbapentin and neither worked well enough for me  It took the edge off but still hurt a ton  I live in a medical state and have my medical marijuana card and that is honestly the only thing that s ever worked for me  Been using it for 8 years and it takes all the pain away Some strains are more effective than others but it works extremely well for me I have found that daily meditation practicing detachment from the feeling of touch has made it more bearable The pain still causes 15 60 second bursts of 9 10 pain but it feels a little more in control now Anxiety seems to play a large role in the intensity and duration of my nerve pain so now I just let it run its course with no objection mentally    1 gabapentin   I tried everything I could think of gabapentin is the only thing that ever worked it is from my lower calves and sides of my feet I ve been off and on Gabapentin but I cannot tell if it does anything at all Does it feel like just a reduction of constant pain I just have spurts of hyper intense pain so maybe that s why it is not working What is warm nmes Suprapubic diversion urineYou may want to check with your physician If a suprapubic catheter becomes blocked urine can drain via the urethra  although this may not be possible for everyone  This can act as a  safety net  for people who get autonomic dysreflexia when their catheter blocks With a suprapubic catheter a person has an alternative entry point to their bladder  via the urethra   Urine can come out your penis  When my husband first got his suprapubic his doc never told him it could leak but it stopped for the most part after a couple of months  Sometimes his tube will get twisted where it is held on his leg and he ll pee through his penis  I haven t gotten one yet but soon The physician I consulted with said that if leaking becomes a problem they can install a type of restriction in a simple procedure    I m sure you ll get this figured out and it would be great if you posted an update for the rest of us   Good luck   I have had one for 3 years  C4 incomplete  I can roll but try to stay off my stomach  Showers are no problem  In warm months I wear shorts and have a valve on the end of the catheter and empty myself when my bladder feels full  I can pee out my penis but only standing up to get gravity help since my bladder contraction muscles don t work  In cold months with long pants I wear a leg bag  It is not glamorous but it works  Thanks for the advice I m still waiting to hear back from the doc but glad I contacted them Thank you   Thank you for the insight Haven t seen any leaking yet but it feels like something wants to come out hopefuly my doc can help    thank you again I m glad to hear hopefully I can suggest this to my doctor because although I have the ability to urinate urethrally as a safety net for my bladder overfilling and causing AD there s tons of internal damage that I d rather let heal before more urine passes through    but other than this I think it s pretty cool not feeling constant Penile pain and reducing the risk of infectionThank you for the breakdown I think it ll take some time to get all the kinks worked out w outfits and bags but there s a learning curve to everything I guess thanks again Has anyone ever seen or tried a female  condom  style catheter  It might be good for travel or when intermittent cathetorizing is not ideal Thx for any tips or leads  Sorry I don t have any personal experience with this but you might enjoy David Sedaris describing his https   youtu be ejEcOMqBvpY The best cath for travel I ve found is the Colopast compact speedicath It comes in a self contained tube and includes a 1L bag Everything is prelubed and pre connected up The cath is telescopic so it s very compact although it is quite hard i e not very flexible Still it does the trick and the whole thing is disposable once you ve emptied the bag The convenience of only having to carry a bunch of these tubes for a day out and maybe a travel pack of wet wipes is awesome I m a guy so I can vouch for the male ones but they do make a female version with appropriate mods Looks like it still all comes in a 20   30cm tube Not quite a wearable item but for a fast pee without having to lug around all the usual paraphenalia they re pretty good  Do you mean like the purewick  Just watched the video    Thx for that link  but also want to try whatever is out there  or invent a better one for us gals who Need a solution Life s too short to have to plan around bathroom breaks I had never heard of them Have you tried one How does it stay in place Just googled  it does look like a hassle and not for travel or being on the move   gotta be something better to allow easy method for self cath if no washroom available My bladder keeps me awake all night long Sounds miserable What volumes do you get when you cath at night Wearing compression socks can prevent the problem with your second bladder emptying at night 2 hours is probably too close to bedtime to stop fluid intake if you want to pursue that approach effectively As far as meds there s a bunch of different pills that range in efficacy and side effects Botox  like you had before  is another option for some folks But if you haven t had it it may be good to get urodynamic studies done to get more info on your bladder function and protect your kidneys  I had exactly this problem up every 2 hours for a pee Finally one of the urology nurses suggested using a bag at night and switching back to intermittent catheters during the day As far as fixing the sleep issue goes perfect Not so good for the partner issue but TBH I d rather the uninterrupted sleep   I use prelubed speedi caths during the day and they re super quick and easy But there s a bit more prep with a bag basically the catheters are not pre lubed and you need to have enough hand control to crack open a sterile 10ml cartridge of water fill a syringe with it and inject it down the second tube within the catheter to inflate the little balloon that holds it in place Obviously you need to lube the catheter and attach it to the bag as well I use a latex glove and those little packets of sterile gel for internal use In 8 years I ve had maybe 2 UTIs and neither could have been blamed on the indwelling catheters Don t worry about technique if you re physically capable your uro people should show you how to do it all   I also produce a lot more urine at night so I had to increase the bag size They go up to 4L which is   for me   peace of mind big enough Whatever your comfort levels keep going until you find something that works for you   there s no reason to have to live with disrupted sleep due to a urology issue  The involuntary leg spasms are called spasticity It is commonly treated with a drug called baclofen  Not a lot small amounts Maybe 200 to 300 mL at a time So throughout the night I normally Pee 1 5 L ish   I will try and stop my liquid consumption at about 8 PM The weird thing about the liquid in my legs is my legs don t appear to be swollen even if I sit in my chair all day long I can try compression socks but to be quite honest I would rather not I m just stubborn that way I like when my legs are out in the sunshine in the summertime     I guess winter is not a bad time to try out long socks  I think I m going to try the Botox injections again when I got them done probably close to a decade ago I had a constant bladder infection and really didn t know how to take care of myself very well now that I have some experience behind me I think not having a bladder infection at the same time as the injections might benefit me more I ll keep this sub Reddit updated regardless of how it goes   ThanksThanks I will definitely talk to my urologist and look into this method I m fairly certain I m getting the spasms in my legs because my bladder is telling me it is full I don t think I would get spasms in my legs if my bladder wasn t telling my legs what to do Baclofen plus Clonidine patches  yes they can be used for spasticity as well as blood pressure etc   Been trying out Botox for some clonus like spastic twitching in my legs Recent C5 C6 quad Confused about ASIA scaleI m a C1 C5 6 ASIA B incomplete But there has been a lot of questioning on where I actually sit on the scale including discussion of ASIA A I m a year out at injury I had slight movement of one finger and some pain Year out more pain and fair amount of movement in one hand as well as my thumbs some limited arm movement   The way I see it it serves as a classification more in rehab hospitial than everyday life I ve not found anyone non medical even remotely interested in my classification and the medical people I do see often disregard the original classification and work off my demonstrated functonality   I also don t really think its always so binary between complete vs incomplete I have at times been described as either one even though my actual functionality has maintained consistent since recovering some hand arm use I asked once an got told I was  in a grey space  between incomplete and complete maybe you re in a similar spot   Spasms do also suck haven t tried CBD  uncontrolled in the UK   but hope it goes good for you    What makes you ASIA A is sacral sensation and function  That s it  That s why saddle numbness and continence changes are a huge deal   I know two folks with incomplete C injuries who walk  one independently and one with crutches  and are classified as ASIA A   Since I was injured I have gone from ASIA B   D  C  It s really easy to focus on the ASIA scale because it s measurable and standardized and quantifiable at a time when nothing is sure or predictable and no one is giving answers that feel real or useful  that s how I felt anyway  but ultimately I didn t find it helpful   I got derailed by it entirely   it was more helpful to me to focus on the gains I made over time and how to improve those and my skills and not worry about the scale   ETA  my experience of CBD is very narrow and specific I have used topical decarboxylated CBD from whole plants  not hemp  and it has been helpful  I have also found NMES to be helpful reducing spasticity although if you re going to go that route you have to commit   it also reduces atrophy so you will retain some strength meaning spasms may become stronger  The way I ve had it explain to me and actually that qualified me from a to b is do you feel a finger being inserted into your sphincter  sounds brutal But I ve heard that from several consultants now If so you may want to try instillagel rather than usual lubricant for your bowel regime The usual name given to people who can move things below injury is C7 preservation and so on  Hi  razorback I was in a similar boat you ve found yourself in I was classified as an A at admission and at 4 months was still an A At six months post I had a re eval and became an Asia C with motor function and sensory I noticed changes in sensation and motor and was like this isn t right To be a defacto incomplete you have to have sensation three levels below your site of injury with strong results   and or anal function sensory I can t feel my legs but I can move them Based off what you wrote it sounds like you re transitioning out of spinal shock and may be a B maybe C  so I would just keep rehabbing and wait for a new re eval There s also another thing called zones of partial preservation which become Greg areas in the Asia A rating Im 10 1 2 months post injury  I m a C7  ish  ASIA C I m a C because I recovered a significant amount of finger function  both hands are about 3 5 strength so a bit clumsy and weak but reasonably useful  and I can slightly wiggle some toes and twitch my left thigh I was reading studies that were saying many ASIA Cs are able to walk and I still can t at almost 5 years and it s such a bummer I m working on letting stuff like that go though it s not beneficial for me to worry about where I think I  should  be I just focused on rehab and recovering what I could and tried really hard not to worry about the statistics and all that   I haven t used CBD for spasms I stick with baclofen and stretching exercises I would like to try MMJ but I can t really afford it right now but I know people with SCI and MS who have had great success with both MMJ and non THC CBD  Okay cool thanks for sharing That s about how my physical therapist answered it and like the rest of the crazy questions I burden her with we both agreed somewhere on it being another weird spinal cord thing not fully understood defined Okay I forgot to mention this but I have some butt sensation haha I can feel when I need to weight shift and once I m in bed my butt stings a little after a long day   That s also exactly how I feel about the ASIA scale and a wise OT told me to ignore it All the scientific studies use it so when I m doing research it s hard to ignore and not get bummed out However what you said is consistent and makes sense so thank you I m L1 Asia A and I m part time walker chair Zero sensation is sacral area is the reason I m classified as A I do  or at least certainly the stims during bowel program  and use dibucaine I suppose I m B I just wonder what made them initially classify me as A Oh well it all seems kind of silly and almost pointless Thank you Can I interview you about your experience So here s the deal   my SCI was over five years ago   I did gait training  with and without robotic assist  inpatient and outpatient in the first few years was walking developed weird complications had multiple follow up surgeries did

reached out to your PCP GP Did the urologist treat you with antibiotics post cystoscopy Often urologists will give prophylactic antibiotics to SCI patients after a cysto  I think you should reach out to your urologist and PCP first thing  I have never had a cystoscopy without prophylactic ABs and some anti inflammatories for the next couple of days so this sounds very miserable to me  I have discussed the issues with the urologist and they sent me for an MRI scan and I have had the results back there doesn t seem to be any serious issues there from what they can see I am now waiting for a phone consultation with them to discuss where to go from here I was just wondering if anyone had ever been in a similar situation to me Yes I have been on numerous occasions and have been treated with

doable In big companies the network admins aren t responsible for hardware installation and the job can be done sitting at a desk  I think it would be better to ask someone on a computer networking sub since they would know the job better than most people here since I m guessing there are not many people here with experience in that field  in comparison especially  Try explaining your situation and I m sure someone in say r computernetworking could answer you  Many of the development and configuration roles including packet capture diagnostics routing management etc can be handled from the

 network cabling patching fiber runs in and out of closets   the spaces ares small narrow very tight tend to be warmer and dustier than expected   unless you re using crutches  and even then  it would be pretty challenging  That s a relief Was really concerned I might not be able to it Thanks again I was going to suggest looking at big companies too I am starting on crutches in therapy now but I

Topomax  It s seemed to take the sharper edges off my nerve pain maybe it could help you  I m on 50mg 2xday  Also dealing with after effects of myelitis  long confusing story  and I m off all nerve pain meds   went through Lyrica Duloextine Amitriptyline Gabapentin none really sat right with me so I just use 30 500 co codamol as and when  sticking obviously to timings  and it works like 80  of the time Nerve pain sucks though so good luck  Using Gabapentin 4X s a day but use Tizanidine when they are really bad Tizanidine is great but knocks me out  Lyrica can potentially have some horrible side effects   My wife was on Lyrica  150mg 3 x daily  for lower back disk injury and whilst it was effective controlling the pain the other effects  weight gain fuzzy head and worse  eventually led to a change to Gabapentin  She had originally tried it on a recommendation but found little result   However we later found she hadn t been given enough   she had been given 200mg 3 x day   Now she is on Gabapentin 900mg 3 x day and it works reasonably well  The major apparent side effect is excessive tiredness   sleepiness   Quite a few Dr s when the hear that she is on 2700mg   day think that is excessive but guidelines allow up to 3500mg   day  prescribed   Im on lyrica cymbalta  more for depression  and the fentanyl patch lol The fentanyl patch works very well but it s last resort of course  I m on Lyrica Topomax and Tizanidine for pain Same side effects sleepiness I just had a spinal cord stimulator implanted this past Friday I am still recovering from surgery and they have not turned it on yet But I will let you know how it helps with the pain in my feet legs and back  I switch from gabapentin to lyrica and I think I noticed an improvement Again hard to say Just remember there may be an underlying reason to your neuropathic pain Fortunately I ve discovered upper limb muscle tightness is responsible for mine So soon I will try to taper down  Tizanidine had some really bad side effects for me   flung my blood pressure all over the place tanked my liver enzymes and I got rebound spasticity  I know everyone s different but keep an eye on your liver numbers This matches my history as well Lyrics side effects too much and now on 2700 mg of gabapentin a day   To the original poster you can also get spinal injections for nerve pain  I ve been going to a pain clinic and they give me about 4 5 injections in my back It has helped  I m still on the gabapentin for now but the hope is to move off of it after sufficient injectionsQuadriplegic at home exercise   Sareem

is an annoying side effect   No experience with Trospium Negative results using Botox  I was going to try it instead of oxybutin but it was super expensive even with insurance I started taking it about a month ago to replace Oxybutinin My bladder is definitely calmer since switching and my dry mouth has improved tremendously  How long have you had Botox How long since the last injection and how many CC s is each Botox infection  I take spasmex 3 times per day Generally works well Normally last 4 5 hours between caths Trospium is much better at calming the bladder vs oxybutin   less dry

injury but any  rehab  facility that lets a patient develop a stage 4 sore is not okay    I wish you your father and your family all the best  I had flap surgery done on my left ischium in 2017 due to stage 4 pressure ulcer  Here are my take aways     As others have said if it s being suggested it s necessary  It s pretty much a last resort     My surgeon flat out said to me that he avoids doing them because of the risk of failure due to patients not listening to instructions Your dad will have to unquestioningly do as he is told by clinicians in order to successfully fully recover from flap surgery     The recovery is by far the worst part Surgery sucks there s no doubt about it But my pain was minimal because most of the surgery site was below my level of injury  But you cannot put pressure on the surgery site whatsoever So after I recovered for 11 days in the hospital I was sent to a long term care hospital to recuperate I spent 62 days in that long term care facility 50 of them  in a row  were spent   flat on my back    They put me in a Clinitron bed  effectively a mattress filled with sand like material that constantly moves underneath you to prevent further pressure sores A bed that wiggled 24 7   I could not roll to either side because of my surgery and varying pressures So it had to be on my back It was absolutely mind numbingly brutal Upon that 51st day I got to sit up  For 15 minutes Then it was back to lying down The next day was increased to 30 min then 45 and so on Once I successfully sat up for a couple hours my  therapy  was complete and they sent me home   with no restrictions really     I was told I was a model flap surgery patient I didn t ever break the rules I did exactly what my surgeons wound care professionals nurses everybody told me to do I never wanted to experience this again and I never wanted this to be a problem again So I was diligent and   never   deviated from instructions As a result I healed as best as expected  It was a success      Fortunately for me I had no real complications Some of my incision site got a little wonky so it s not pretty But after going through that hellish year I don t care about my scars I m glad to be alive  I got septic from my pressure sore  Almost didn t make it    All in all would I do it again Dear God I hope I never have to It was probably the worst experience of my life other than breaking my back  But with a life threatening stage 4 you don t have many more options  Tell your dad to do it to listen to everything he s told and he will come out of it okay  Happy to share any other information if you have questions I m not shy  I ve had rotational flaps on both ischial tuberosities They work a treat Good fresh new think skin to pad you over for a few decades Highly recommend before you get too old and you skin thins  I had a flap surgery to close a sacral pressure wound I spent 2 weeks flat on my back on a sand bed Healed nicely looks gruesome though  It just occurred to me   there are these weird glasses with sort of triangle reflective prism things and one of the nurses loaned me a pair after a surgery that kept me flat on my back for a month so that I could still read and stuff bc I wasn t allowed to lift my arms or anything  I will ask around and see if any of my family remembers what they were called but maybe someone else here or one of the OTs your dad works with will know   ETA  they re called periscope readers or horizontal lazy readers  They were a big help  I have It is absolutely brutal but usually when the wound care docs are recommending it it s necessary The toughest part is sticking to the recovery regime but it was the best choice by far Find a surgeon who has done this before because it s a specialist operation and you need somebody who specializes in reconstruction Ischial or Sacral  I had flap surgery on my left and right ischium at the same time Everything went well I was in the hospital on bed rest for 6 weeks so that sucked but it healed great and hasn t happened again Just gotta find a plastic surgeon that s done it before Flap surgery is a pretty basic procedure for surgeons so as long as you find someone that has experience with it I think you ll be in good hands Good luck I know how rough of a road pressure sores are but hopefully it s almost over  Have any of you used sachril bandages to protect the wound site afterwards I m looking at ways of preventing this from happening again Currently on my 3rd week in rehab  We are exploring options to seek legal action It s really so infuriating He also had bad shivers daily while at rehab They never thought to check for a UTI He s had an ongoing UTI for the last 3 weeks that likely started while he was there I feel your pain Twice   I had a bursa fail in my left buttock  after 35  years in a chair  the doctor said there was nothing I could do  and the doctor at the VA told me I needed flap surgery and that I would be on my back for six weeks then an additional two weeks before I could sit in my chair for eight hours   No Way   I went to an outside doctor who was board certified in wound care She assured me that we could avoid surgery I wasted five months trying everything to get the wound to close At the end she suggested flap surgery I left her and went straight to the VA The sympathetic nurse told me that most of the vets try to avoid the surgery as I had but eventually they have to have it   My story mirrors yours Clinitron 48 days flat on my back Model patient Absolutely dedicated to the task of GFTO the hospital and back to life   Success I did it   Five months later my wife is doing the nightly skin inspection  Uh oh   she says Turns out that a bursa failed on the other side I knew that I d have to return to have another flap surgery on the other side   I wept like a baby I knew what I was facing   So back to the VA Same doctors same wound care nurses Yes I d have to have another flap surgery I waited for three months for a slot in the wound care clinic   Another flap surgery Another Clinitron stay But now I get complications A misplaced Foley catheter leads to blood loss due to the blood thinners I m on I wake at two in the morning my lower section bathed in blood I calmly call the nurse station tell them what I have discovered I require my first blood transfusion Then a UTI leads to sepsis and I need to be on powerful IV antibiotics Then the light above my bed breaks in such a way that it cannot be turned off  now I have a light beaming down on my face making the already impossible task of sleeping on my back a torture   But I remain a model patient courteous and understanding and patient   I again make it out of there after two months   TLDR  Flap surgery in 2017 and 2018 Success and life returns to normal I m going through this now To make sure it never happens again I will have a stand up chair when I go home Currently I m on week 3 of flat on my back Was it fully recovered in those 2 weeks Thanks for your reply What about it was brutal   The surgeon does seem really great in this operation It will be on his sacrum   What did your recovery timeline look like At the hospital at rehab at home I am not an expert in these things but I do work for a major medical supply company I think it s more effective to be properly offloaded have a good mattress and eat well to heal your body A lot of people do like the sacral bandages but I am not totally sure if they do much if it s not an open wound I hope someone else has some insight   Are you in rehab due to flap surgery How is it going so far I am moving for the first time to another state Do you have any tips on how to make sure I have the same level of care provided or any other tips I think caregiving is going to really depend on how you pay for it   out of pocket insurance or Medicaid   and if Medicaid whether you qualify where you re going and if so if you re going through an agency or hiring waiver pcas directly  It might be worth reaching out to SCI groups in whatever area you re moving to  Texas is big   and seeing if there s a meeting you could zoom into or something   If you don t already have all the DME supplies you need try and get set up with that before you go and make sure you have extras for the window while you get established find a pcp and pmr doc  Contact the Center for Independent Living for where you are moving They can probably help you understand your benefits  Would it be alright if I sent you a dm My boyfriend and I are trying to move to WA and we re wondering about the exact same thing  There are a few support groups in Texas you can find here   https   www spinalcord com sci support groups texas  https   www spinalcord com sci support groups texas  One silver lining of the virus is many of these groups have moved to an online virtual format so you may be able to reach out to the administrator of a few of the groups to get more info and join some of the meetings even before you arrive Yes for sure SCI and antidepressants Hi I have clinical depression and take Wellbutrin without a doubt this medication changed my life Gives me a boost of energy doesn t affect sex drive doesn t make me cloudy or anything like that but rather clear headed I ve had an sci for about a year and a half and have been taking the medication since before my injury That being said I can t imagine going through all of this without it My first year after the sci was the worst but I assure you it does get easier Number one thing I would say is regardless of what your outcome may look like never stop doing physical therapy and never stop working towards improvement  Physical therapy is extremely important for your mental health as well  Progress is nail biting slow but there is progress Best of luck to you you got this  Hi Im on cymbalta  and lamictal  It definitely helps mellow me out I get to the edge of the cliff when I m really sad but I don t fall off and have a breakdown if you get what I mean Let me know what other questions you have  Many antidepressants are also used for neuropathic pain management  cymbalta imipramine most of the tricyclics  in SCI as are some atypical antiseizure partial seizure management meds  Keppra Topamax   I was put on cymbalta for neuropathic pain but I found that it also helps my depression The only reason I figured that out is because I had to wait on a refill for a few days While not taking it I felt so sad and felt outside of my body It was very odd  Thanks all He is 4 days on Wellbutrin which I understand can take a few weeks to kick in He said he s eager for it to start working Everything makes him cry right now  Small frustrations Being around family and being grateful Tiny discussions with my mom Thinking about how upcoming hospital stay Seeing an old picture of me as a child Everything  Thank you   I was asking for my dad who got injured July 25 Wellbutrin is what he was prescribed and hopefully will start taking it tomorrow There s been many secondary conditions from his injury  UTI pressure injury  it s really taken a toll on him mentally We also think it s PTSD from the trauma of nearly drowning to death   Did the Wellbutrin affect your bladder or sleeping habits at all I d also recommend  if he s not doing this already  therapy Therapy   medication have the best outcomes When you have an injury you re going through a loss and most people don t know how to deal with that loss and grief It s definitely helpful to have a professional help with processing all that So I was coming back from camping with my boyfriend and we popped into Brockville Ontario We where waking through the park when wow   it s a super accessible play ground Complete with an amazing bathroom   I m impressed because this town literally only has 22 000 people You go Brockville Ah Canada That fairytale land where things make sense  This is super impressive     thanks for sharing  That s really awesome to see Thanks for sharing  Is it common for people with SCI to have dangerously low levels of vitamin D Yes The less you go outside the lower your vitamin D leves get A couple of years ago I was really feeling unwell constantly fatigued and depressed Got my vitamin D results back and what do you know   it was 7 1nmol l The absolute minimum should be 75nmol l so mine was 10 times lower than the minimum healthy range My doctor had never seen such a low number before   I m too aftaid to check my bone density levels because those are most probably fucked too So yeah take those supplements better safe than sorry  Yes because we are not up and using our bones they will become soft and brittle Being on vitamin supplements is your only option really  I love being in the sun and try to get as much as I can but even so my levels were still low enough that my doctor put me on a daily D3 supplement about 2 years ago  Make sure that the D3 you re taking also has K2  Calcium is important as well but as others have mentioned you should do bloodwork to check levels We also give my son methylated B12 We don t know if he has the MTHFR gene mutation but I think he may since I do   Supplements and sunlight are important but weight bearing is probably more so We try to get him weight bearing as much as possible Not his favorite thing but all his recent xrays and bloodwork came back mostly all within normal parameters with the exception of alkaline phosphatase being low They said this should increase as we increase weight bearing and exercise  I know I do  I don t mind taking them but it seems like our bodies don t even absorb them that well Idk Hip and tailbone removedThis does not sound like a standard procedure that could be found on the Internet it sounds like the doctors have to remove some locations where the infection has become intractable They may not even be able to predict the amount of tissue they need to remove Don t intellectualize this Tell your brother that you love him and support him and let him make his own decisions It does not sound like he is asking for your advice What he needs from you is love acceptance and possibly physical help  This sounds like a modified girdlestone amputation  I suggest that you go to the carecure forums and post a question for the SCI nurses  There are also folks there who have had this procedure and talk about the recovery etc  Thank you I truly appreciate your advice  I had a palialitle cyst that turned into a pressure sore and they removed my tailbone when they did the muscle flap surgery It was to prevent future problems Thank you so much for the info Great lead on contacting the SCI nurses I truly appreciate you taking the time to write in Paralyzed as a kid jumping off a

language so I understood what was being said Lauren Doherty   My experiences with pressure sores  Living with a Spinal Cord InjuryI m currently going through my first bought with a sore Tried wound vac first but ended up having surgery How long after surgery did you try using a shower chair That s what has me afraid I use it for my bowl program before my shower and can be in it up to 2 hours I never want another one if I can help it  Same have a vac now but no idea how long it will take close up after that This the second time first time it stagnated after I got back from the hospital Fingers crossed I spent 7 days adventuring in the backwoods with my canoe and one of my pack dogs This was one heck of an awesome experience What caused your injury Riding motorcycle when dui driver turned in front of me Flew 40 ft over her car Oh hell yes I blame her for her selfishness Didn t help when she plead guilty she got no jail time  8 years probation  and when she spoke in court and after in the hallway she didn t apologize Screw her because she absolutely ruined my life plan AND gave me endless days of constant pain I cope with loads of love and support from wife kids family and

hope but when I start becoming unable to care for myself again and I guess it depends how much new pain I get I m a c4 inc wc user  I m just curious what level is your injury I m a quad with arm function and couldn t imagine this being a reason for me to want my life Not trying to detract from what you might decide or your feelings about it  If you type in life coach sheryn you ll find a channel on YouTube of a woman who opted for this after becoming a quad She talks a little about the process she went through to apply but I believe they were undecided on whether or not to go through with it due to her having a depressive disorder Their reasoning was if she could get treated for the depression then maybe she wouldnt want to go through with it anymore Later she decided not to do it at all for other reasons She actually has been active on this subforum   Edit  found the link   video   https   youtu be Tk1YsEAdaD8  So are you saying your quality of life has improved I think my biggest fear there is the possibility of surviving which I have seen in hospital and they end up way worseI worked it out to be about 18000 dollars Considering it would be an end of things I don t know what I would consider pricey Also a quad with limited arm function and I wouldn t end my life due to my paralysisDo you have anyone that depends on you or are you on your own I m curious as to what you think about the situation   My entire life was martial arts and climbing and being in the ocean and hiking I don t see a point in not being able to do these things anymore Sure they can be done adaptively but it is nowhere near the same Thanks for your responseUni Students in the Netherlands  1 Minute QuestionnaireNot really sure if you are solving a problem here Forward and sideways balance is something that needs to be learned by experience and I don t see how a device that warns you when you reach the limit really helps As a wheelchair user you have to go to that limit or beyond  while supporting yourself  often to be functional and learning how to push the limits is extremely important It could possibly be useful in a training setting at a rehabilitation centre but I don t see it being useful at home Might be good for you to contact a revalidatie centrum I believe Libra in Eindhoven does dwarsleasies Physios there should be able to give you a lot of insight into the kind of training one does to get better at balancing in a wheelchair  Posting again Failed artificial disc surgery in Bogen Germany 2009 Can t sit or lay down Cost me my retirement fund What are your options A surgeon botched my hands so badly that I m looking into amputation Either that or suicide  The doctor that did my my last two fusions was one of the doctors that invented the artificial disc at UCSF He has told me many times that it has not lived up to its promise and that very few patients had good outcomes especially patients that had it done at multiple levels He said his team is still working on refining it but the trials so far are not looking promising  I m so sorry you have to deal with this especially over 10 years Unfortunately there are no easy fixes to spinal problems I doubt most people with old injuries will ever be  fixed  in the future Do you have any idea what you can do for some rel  Can t help you after the surgery but i have a broken L4 vertebrae and spondylolisthesis at L4 5  physiotherapy and exercise has really helped me I exercise twice a day and have to do it for the rest of my life But it is fair enough if it keeps my pain under control  Come to korea to get surgery i can guarantee its gonna be much better cheaper and faster I m just so sorry    I hope that you find some relief  Have you thought of setting up a Go Fund Me page At least some donations would help you a bit in your housing situation   I m miserable and brain damaged too I can t say anything on Reddit Too late for me My dr was in Germany He destroyed my life They

with a spine and brain injuryHelp with balanceFind a good PT to work on your core I use both a PT and on other days a personal trainer to build upon what the PT has done  I have a brace that enables me to live If you can find anyone who does gyrokinesis it is incredibly helpful  I am really asymmetrical in terms of core strength but have been able to get much better balance by working with someone really knowledgeable  Also it s going to sound crazy but make sure you are stretching often and really well and both sides equally  I know a couple higher level injuries who use an abdominal binder for better stability sitting in their chair wouldn t provide a ton of support but might help  I wore an ab binder in the beginning that helped me immensely I m c7 thanks for the suggestions Yes this is a super good recommendation   a good PT who can help you with roll over exercises on a mattress can help gain good torso stability I am a para for 15 years now that exercise helped me gain

with them so my way of truly thanking them is to carry on Please you do the same and advocate for your care  My SCI StoryThank you for sharing Thanks for sharing I had my SCI two months ago and can t stop thinking about my mistake leading up to my injury and accepting the outcome It seems like the more I recover physically the worse I become emotionally Do you have any tips for emotional perseverance I keep beating myself up because I can walk unassisted now and I know others would love to be in my shoes I should be thankful but I have such a hard time imagining how I can go on like this for the rest of my life T5 High five   Thank you for sharing I m new to SCI T12 complete any advice for trying to overcome the emotional aspects of an SCI  Thank you for sharing  It s no problem I enjoy sharing and meeting new people You will persevere The body is a miraculous wonder Never give up and always push the hardest you can It gets easier with time the first two years for me were the hardest But you learn to adapt and challenge yourself more and more every day what was your mistake It s hard I seen your post here on the scar Make a good story You have to stay positive You are still you You just changed physically It s normal to experience all kinds of emotions after an SCI Feel free to message if you or anyone here needs some peer support I m glad to help Adaptive

something smaller and affordable Those travel chairs are more than 1k   Are there tests for nerve damage  There s something called an EMG  electromyography  that tests electrical signals your muscles make both when they re active and inactive  Also a nerve conduction study measures how fast and how well the body s electrical signals travel down your nerves  Both of these can be used to measure nerve activity and response    Are there tests for nerve damage   There are neurological examinations like testing for presence of pathological reflexes and absence of regular reflexes muscle weakness and sensory deficits   https   en wikipedia org wiki Neurological_examination  And there are device assisted methods like evoked potential measurement electromyography and electroencephalography   https   en wikipedia org wiki Evoked_potential  And there are imaging methods like CT MRI fMRI PET SPECT and probably more    edit   nerve damage  is an incredibly generic term that can mean anything from traumatic injuries to neoplasms and cyst to demyelinating autoimmune or infectious diseases  There s also stuff they do directly to your cord during neurosurgery to monitor what s being affected    If this is a new injury it ll be a while before everything shakes out and you can figure out what s being caused by spinal shock bruising etc  clt716 is correct They also do a NCV test usually with your emg I would also suggest that you research and find a good place to get your emg done There is a skill to getting a proper read via placing the needles I would personally recommend a university teaching hospital if you have one close to you I would also recommend doing this thru a Neurology Group Spinal Cord Injury or Scoliosis Organisations How is everyone I ll lighten the mood here  Life

Seriously I have never seen a more gilded post Random question lolWhat state Adaptive devices  hand controls etc  are a C restriction in California  CaliforniaGeorgia Tech Wheelchair Tech Usability StudyShroom s and autonomic dysreflexiaMy friend has a lower level SCI so she cannot speak to AD   If you decide to try them here are some things you may want to keep in mind   Increase in blood pressure Not a huge amount but just be mindful of it   Alternatively a decrease in blood pressure Make sure you have a way to get horizontal head between the knees if you need to at any time during the trip so you won t pass out   Increase in muscle spasms possibly for hours Sometimes mild sometimes strong I ve heard it s often worth it though  Be careful because sometimes knees will lock together which may cause pressure marks to form   Time dilation This is a normal part of a mushroom trip and normally would be of no concern but paralyzed people live by the clock Don t forget to do pressure shifts for your skin to take care of any bladder and bowel needs or to take necessary medications Set alarms on your phone so you can relax and not worry about the clock Drink water   Also remember that if you have chronic pain mushrooms will likely reduce or remove that pain so you ll probably push your body more than you would on a typical day Have pain meds ready to take before bed   Finally type out a list that has your SCI level and any other medical conditions  all your medications  plus the fact that you ve taken mushrooms the amount and the time you ingested them In the VERY slight chance you do have to go to the hospital instead of having to answer a bunch of questions coming at you when you re high as fuck you just throw this list at them I m not saying you ll end up in the ER if you take shrooms    it s just kind of a security blanket more than anything   One good thing about being in a wheelchair disabled and tripping is that you can go out in public and act like a complete doofus and no one will blink an eye Just sit and stare at a tree for twenty minutes and laugh no one will care   Edit  Now that I think about it maybe don t write down on that typed list that you took shrooms because I wouldn t want you to get into any legal trouble  Save that info for verbal transmission  But the rest of it    SCI level conditions medications    that s a good list to have on you not just for a trip but all the time really  I would recommend doing the lemon tek method as they come on fast hit hard and don t linger for hours Might be good to get it over with if your body is not having a good time I have a lower injury and it all goes through my bladder super fast    Grind the mush up good let it sit in lemon for 20 mins and pour some hot water in it then drink  The first time I took shrooms I believe it was only 1 5 grams   My spasticity was  unusual I wasn t violently spastic but the spasms were not enjoyable Within 15 20 minutes after taking the shrooms the skin on my legs started moving in a manner not dis similar to when a horse shakes off a fly There were a lot of goosebumps going on The spasticity was bad enough I thought I might have a bowel accident from everything clenching a bit The nerves kept firing in my twenty years atrophied pectoral muscles They were not bad just constant   I developed a massive amount of phlegm I m a C4 quad so needed assistance leaning forward so I could cough it up I can tell you from experience that you don t want a high friend helping you out with something that feels like a medical emergency This occured about an hour into the trip  maybe sooner It was as if I developed instant pneumonia I ended up calling a care provider in to monitor me while I rode out the rest of the trip The phlegm subsided with time   I had no autonomic dysreflexia issues   It was fun for the first 45 60 minutes and then the phlegm got crazy and things got scary feeling  I tried micro dosing a few times afterward and experienced the spasms but not the phlegm I wanted visuals though and micro dosing just doesn t get you there I moved on from shrooms to DMT and have been much happier  Done shrooms lsd and dmt multiple times as a t4 t5 complete spasms are massively strong while tripping and the shaking of my legs pretty much don t stop and they continue 1 2 days after tripping whenever I think it s annoying to deal with I just jump over to the couch and sit on my legs make sure you don t hurt urself tho  and it makes it super easy to deal with  T3 complete   I used to love drugs but after my accident not so much Acid and shrooms are the worst in my opinion   the spasms I get are just incredibly painful and violent and the level of sweat is ungodly Molly and X is more enjoyable  less side effects  But mainly I just smoke weed now maybe some coke here and there   But over all the spasms I get just make it not worth it in my opinion  lol DO NOT do shrooms if you fear spasms nonstop for 6  hours  the only way I survived my shroom trip was by smoking ALOT of weed that day and consuming edibles and oils I know this sounds crazy but the spasms were so bad I was getting AD Furthermore since I was tripping my mental state was horrible because I was witnessing my legs move without my control and it was depressing and scaring me As well as the person I was with   personally I would never do shrooms again And I don t think anyone with an SCI should either but that s just my opinion and you re free to have your own experiences    Everyone I know that has done them have violent spasms for hours It makes you sweat an incredible amount also If you re going to do them make sure you re in an environment where you can control the temperature and have plenty of water available  This is great information what are the side effects of DMT im in the same boat as this guy except im t6 complete and swap shrooms out for 2cb  but yeah my legs go wild for days after lsd  and even mdma    dmt they stop pretty much right after the trip ends though which is hella nice  normally they are not too bad  its manageable if you re on the couch  but in the chair its kinda dumb wouldnt really want to go anywhere with spasms like that   aside story  one time my ex and I did 2cb and we ended up in the hospital cause she had a bad trip and got super scared cause her heart was racing and she thought something bad was happening lol  i kept trying to eat more baclofen to calm my spasms down in the hospital so they took it away from me cause they told me i was on enough drugs lolFoley care  painHoly shit Story of my life In case no one else brings it up or asks what size catheter  16 French  and what size balloon  30mL  and how full are you filling it  10 mL    See if it helps by getting away from a sitting position and on to your hip I m curious if the pressure between your urethra and you re sitting surface could be contributing compressing pinching things off Along the same lines when was the last time you had a bowel movement I believe a firm sitting surface combined with forgive the expression a  full rectal vault   could contribute to difficulty draining   Are you also having bladder spasms strong urge to urinate Is there a possibility you have any kind of infection   I m looking forward to what you find out from the others here  I hope you figure it out the only problem I ve ever had has been with my pajamas kinking the hose or when my dog desires to lay on it  My T1 incomplete story  25 male T2 t3 complete thanks for sharing  Recovery is usually the most significant in the first couple of years But I know I would have people still get recovery overtime   One thing you can be grateful for is your recovery has been quick so usually people that recover quickly continue to get good returns   So I hope that is the case for you  Thanks for sharing your story   glad to hear you re doing so well and regained so much   While each SCI is unique I experienced a similar outcome and 1 and a half years later am still working on getting my right foot to dorsiflex   SCIs at a young age are humbling wake up call for how precious life is  Best

get it down  Books for a man with recent SCI Tight Banding It s pretty common in traumatic SCI   tends to happen at level of injury  Whether it goes away or not is highly variable I had it in acute rehab and they treated it as nerve pain but what actually helped was dry needling and myofascial massage  suggested by pt   Mine feels like an internal corset and I haven t been able to find any more info on this or even be able to describe it well It tends to come and go for me  Okay wait though  No one warned you about this in rehab  I m not asking to be a jerk I am seriously shocked and flummoxed That s about how mine feels Some days are worse than others It also feels like a belt tide around my abdomen in two different areas Recovery is now delayedHow to stay on insuranceMedicaid isn t insurance It s really designed as free healthcare for poor people The buy in programs are great but it still doesn t make Medicaid like regular insurance plans which almost never cover personal assistant services and have all sorts of additional costs You re stuck with state rules on Medicaid   Plenty of disabled people in the US live on just SSI and that s like  12 000 or less They live unstable and uncomfortable lives You have to get government everything to exist   I wouldn t move if I were you Unless you can make enough money to replace the support from the Medicaid benefits You re definitely lucky where you are at right now  Here s another thing to consider about Utah   the waitlist for adult HCBS is 8 years  You can qualify and get approved in weeks but funding is prioritized for children so you will not get funded until every single child who needs services and all adults who predate you on the list receive services  If you need paid care it will be out of pocket until you come up on the list  Voc Rehab is the same situation last I heard the waitlist is longer    I have friends and family there there is fantastic rehab in SLC  Neuroworx  every single person I know there told me do not move to Utah unless you are independently wealthy forever    If you went to acute rehab in Colorado  Craig  call outpatient case management and ask them for suggestions  You could try reaching out the SCI program at the U and see if they have any ideas  Look if you need to move It and AZ Are all back for the working disabled for the disabled in general

 Best bed for a busted old back If you can get your doctor to refer you to an OT for some help figuring out your best options  There are a lot of choices surprisingly and an OT may be able to get you a loaner or two to try out   I use an air mattress on a leggett and platt adjustable frame  I have two fusions  c6 t2  t8 l2  and 7 total laminectomies  t2 8   I don t thermoregulate well well and so all of the latex and memory foam options make me feel sticky and overheated  Can my dad use a regular wheelchair Usually ATPs  Assistive Technology Professionals  write for these  If you have a good OT you might ask them for advice or suggestions  Different states  if you re in the US  often have nonprofits that have lightly used dme including wheelchairs travel chairs  For different models I would recommend contacting a specialist  durable medical equipment  who would be able to either show or recommend different companies   As someone who is younger but has a higher level injury than your father he absolutely can use a manual wheelchair It is very important that he is comfortable in it for many hours   My recommendation is get one that can tilt so that he can recline easily Second a very high back so that resting becomes easy Third the cushion needs to be ROHO  or something similar  to prevent pressure sores Fourth consider a headrest Fifth remember to have extra padding for the armrest  elbows also develop sores    Something you can look at  it has some features not all     https   www sunrisemedical co uk wheelchairs quickie tilt in space wheelchairs iris  https   www sunrisemedical co uk wheelchairs quickie tilt in space wheelchairs iris   I personally use a motorized wheelchair which has leg raising back tilting body tilting It has a headrest and I use the ROHO back and cushion The model I have is Quickie Q 700 Highly recommended When he is tired it is very easy to recline and because it is solid it does not fell like it would accidentally tip It can also be switched to a manual mode  not easy for long distance is but definitely doable for the house    I hope both of you find the model you like Good luck on the path to recovery  If your dad will be in the wheel chair for longer than an hour borrow the seat cushion from the electric chair and make sure to do a pressure break for 5 minutes every hour to prevent pressure sores  It would have to have a pretty high back  Ask about getting a second controller for the back of the power chair I think there is a way to control it from behind with a second controller That s a better solution if he already has a well fitting chair You might also find a way to move the controller from front to back   https   mobilitymgmt com Articles 2015 06 01 Alternative Driving Controls aspx m 1 Page 2  You can disengage the motor and push but you ll get tired fast and it s not safe on uneven ground  Will the DME not loan you another chair until his comes in  Or put an alternate driver setup on it for you  Six weeks is really not long and getting into a manual chair w tilt in space unless you luck out with something used is going to take a while  Thanks  yes we have a roho cushion Thank you That is what we are doing for his  real  chair but I am trying to find a solution for the next 6 weeks or so until it comes Intermittent catheterYou are not alone It takes some getting used to for sure and I would be amazed if anyone came out of a 20 minute training session totally able to do it themselves Just keep trying It s helpful to have someone on hand while you re learning cause sometimes the stress of needing to pee can make it even harder Give it a couple try s each time you have to cath and if it s not working out this round let your caregiver take over and try it again next time You can even do it tandem where maybe your caregiver helps you prepare and get into position and you just do the actual insertion or vice versa   I m assuming they gave you a mirror during training so you can actually see what you re doing right I know some people can cath by feeling alone but that takes a lot of practice   Also let your OT know that you re practicing self cath and they can give you some additional practice like putting a straw into a small hole Idk your injury level but if your hands are impacted at all practicing that kind of precision is really helpful  While I m not a female after reading your post I felt like I needed to reply I started intermittent catheterizing myself around a month ago When they showed me how to do it in the office I was so nervous that I was shaking and had a very difficult time getting it in And for the first week I lived in dread of having to do it because it was so very uncomfortable I started bleeding the first couple of days which I was told can be a side effect of starting to catheter But something happened after like a week or so It just became very normal and really easy to do I don t think twice about it now and it really is relieving to know there is an easy way to completely empty my bladder I wish you the best of luck with it  Hi I also use ntermittent catheter and it requires patience even when you have a lot of practice  I have been doing it for 15 years and it still takes time and patience  What really helps me is to use a mirror that can be adjusted  I can send you a photo just DM me your email  and a headlamp lol looks like I m going to a cave but having good light helps A LOT to find the urethra Regarding the pain use lidocaine to lubricate and anesthetize And always wash your hands very well and clean the area to avoid UTIs  The pain might go away as you practice and get better at inserting it at the correct angle Also some catheters and lubricants are easier than others The Coloplast speedicath are super slippery and Bard s Magic 3 Go are soft and flexible  You didn t exclude male comments so I hope this is okay  I shattered my back when I was 13  My IC  training  was one nurse and about 5 minutes of stick it in the hole then wash it and you can put it in your pocket for use later  yeah really times have changed in 30 years    My only advice other than lots of lube would be to relax as much as possible  This can make a huge difference in the  clench  factor    One last thing while you are learning it is best not to stretch the time between IC windows  I have found the more full a bladder is the more effort it takes to open sometimes   Good luck  Hey I just started last November I asked the exact same question on here too here s the link  https   www reddit com r spinalcordinjuries

disabled  F  but not SCI and I was an OTA who worked with folks who have SCI I self cath and have found ways to do it that really help me Please tell me how to post pictures because they are worth 1k words  Okay here s one item I took a pic of   https   www amazon com Sammons Preston Catheterization Paraplegics Quadriplegics dp B06XTJVGGZ  I own this mirror and it goes with me everywhere in the backpack on my wheelchair It s expensive I know but I ve not found another that works for me   I wrap it around my left leg  not too tight or you could hurt your skin or decrease circulation  and its great  Here s another thing I use Not exactly this one but very similar Especially useful when transferring to toilet at home Less useful for wheelchair cathing  see leg mirror by Sammons Preston for WC use    https   www amazon com dp B079NWHWNL ref cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fab_ic1EFbAGQRSZ0  I use something like this and I hang a cheap Goody mirror on it like this one   https   www amazon com dp B00P74HAY8 ref cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fab_Xf1EFb2YD5861  There s a bunch of these at Walmart Whatever mirror you use has to have a bendy handle that holds the angle   I use a washcoth tied around the mirror s handle to help it stay put on the stand but you could just as well duct tape it to the stand This solution has worked well for me at home but I use the leg mirror when out and about   I tried several stand mirrors that you d normally use on the countertop but none were tall enough Hence the adjustable height purse stand   Hope that helps a little  I m not a woman but four things I ve learned     Even with the prelubed Magic3 Go ADD LUBE    Get a tube of Surgilube at a local pharmacy or KY Jelly and put a big gob of it on the end    If you get to the bladder muscle  sphincter  and can t go in don t back out and push back in repeatedly This causes trauma and hurts    Instead when you find you are  knocking on the door  just hold the catheter in place with a little pressure and wait Deep breaths in and fully out Try to relax I ve had this take a solid 3 minutes before but then suddenly the muscle finally lets go and you re in like Flynn    The most painless way to intermittent cath is laying down on a bed with pillows propping you up As I m still fairly new to this I m putting down an absorbent pad and have one of those 1 liter bedside urinals It takes a little bit of coordination not to spill thus the pad   When I was cathing standing sometimes it was fine with lots of coughing and throat clearing to get past the various bends  women s urethra is a lot straighter whereas guys have to make a shallow turn and then a near 90 degree turn   And sometimes it hurt like hell I d traumatize myself and even a blood clot once Not good  Laying on a bed and giving yourself plenty of time instead of rushing or getting impatient and pushing harder is what has worked for me   Apparently there is some pelvic training  kegel  possible to teach not only tensing up but voluntary relaxing which you need to cath consistently I am to the point now where I have maybe 1 second of pain the entire time It takes patience and relaxing  Male here Are you guys not using ky jelly  heyo i am quite young  sorry lol  and have just learned how to do my catheter myself during quarantine all i can really say is that it takes time i ll edit this comment if i think of anything else to add    Thank you so much   I have a mirror at home I m using I tried again earlier and it was still quite painful but I m determined to make it work   Hi I m  20F  not OP but also really really struggling with the intermittent catheter partly because my legs are an absolute pain in the butt to control Are you able to cath in bathrooms places outside home Has it become normal and a pretty mundane practice for you I feel so so discouraged because I can t seem to master it and it feels like I ll never reach that point of independence   Having a good light source is so important I have to go get my feeding tube changed today  brings new meaning to  hold my feeding tube   and may not respond right away if you reply but feel free to DM me if you need more ideas I ll respond when I can Thank You To EveryoneI am not in your shoes but have a family member going thru a similar injury currently If you ever need someone to vent to feel free to shoot me a message  Neuropathic PainActivity really helps me  small movements stretching exercise of any kind that involves weight bearing Keeping warm is also beneficial Hope you can find some relief How much gabapentin are you taking every day and when  There are other medications you can try don t know if you ve already run through them or not  I found Lyrica  Pregabalin  to be superior to Gabapentin  I m also taking Topomax  Topiramate  which has reduced it as well  It still gets pretty bad some days but the stabby ness has gone down  I know that there are others but these two are the ones that I ve tried   Edit  Someone s makin it rain in here I ve been through all them and now use Duloxetine 120mg day Found it s much more effective but not nearby so sedating Short term try to move or massage or use a tens machine if u have one Otherwise distraction can help if you can find something to occupy your mind it will reduce your awareness of it Put your hand in ice water that sort of thing can also help   Good luck It can be a lot worse with temperature fluctuations and even humidity changes  Staying warm really helps    Movement massage acupuncture tens nmes tigers balm patches hot pepper cream   all of those things were helpful to me  I failed gabapentin and pregabalin don t tolerate opiates well can t take nsaids bc bleeding   I get it when I sit still for too long cold also triggers it but I found smoking weed that is not too high in THC helps for it  I don t take any meds for it What I learned in the rehab hospital is to take something rough like a scratch pad or wool and rub skin with it and work your way to something smoother like silk and it relieves the neuropathy I have a neuropathic itch in my elbows and I have to use it for that  Hi I hope you are feeling a bit better  For me a hot water bottle helps  without the cover  Just have to make sure it s not scalding hot  made that mistake a bunch of times  I didn t find Gabapentin helped me at all unfortunately and I gave it a shot twice At the moment I m on dihydrocodiene and oxycodone and any breakthrough pain I take some ibuprofen Wish I could be of more help I know how much the pain sucks It s all you can focus on Fingers crossed you get a bit more relief    Salt float pod  Floating without any effort in warm water  and darkness should you want  is the only thing that keeps me sane when my nerve pain is at it s worst  I started using a float pod last year and it has increased my quality of life  Otherwise maybe a hot bath might help if you are mobile enough to safely do so   I have tried Gabapentin and other neuropathic medications with no luck  All I did was gain weight and make things even harder on my back I got off gabapentin and all neuropathic pain drugs Still use a weak opioid but when possible I try to distract myself with physical action or just taking my focus away   I also found roller bars roller balls   mine  https   www amazon co uk gp product B01FHYA28I ref ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00 ie UTF8 psc 1   help me out a bit no idea why but it hurts like hell when doing it but ten twenty minutes after it calms down and can help avoid my pain meds  If you re in a state where it s legal try and find a decent dispensary  probably not a chain  and get topical CBD that is not hemp derived and has been decarboxylated  You need the entourage effect from the other cannabinoids and they re much more effective when decarboxylated  It can be hard to find but ime works really well for nerve pain  As bad as it hurts at first a shower with light scrubbing with a sponge on the area really helps me Then cover it in Lidocaine cream  Try acupuncture It s not something you need to do everyday but even once or twice a month it can have lasting effects It s how I got off norco Since being home I ve been doing some range of motion in the morning with my wife before she goes to work It s just not been this bad until today 300 mg three times a day Thank you I m going to my primary doctor next week  Maybe she can help Being new to all this It s a lot different Thank you for the advice I ve never really been a weed smoker but I ve thought about trying it since my SCI Okay this is pretty genius  I used to go do sensory deprivation tanks just to turn my brain off I love getting in the pool I don t know why this hasn t occurred to me or anyone who puts up with me  Thank you so much I am not OP obvs but thank you The roller bars textured foam rollers were suggested in rehab as some combination of they move the muscles enough to relax them but better yet stimulate the nerves into firing

paraplegic since march  Life is pretty fucked up right now UC Davis Engineers Lead  36M Effort to Improve Recovery From Spinal Cord InjuriesHaha that s my school  SCI cure via PowerPoint   Seriously drawing a diagram is one thing But the spinal cord isn t a bundle of wires It s a bunch of  living  cells SCIs don t just sever the connection between the cells they damage break and destroy the cells themselves When the cells are damaged enough or just dead they no longer respond to external stimuli in the desired way   You d have to record the activity at some place above the injury  including the brain  and then stimulate the muscle groups directly as the connection from the spinal cord to the muscle may no longer be functional  Have any of you ever had any experience getting a grant for making accessibility changes to a home Just bought a house Most of the foundations that do grants like this are highly regionally specific and require that the referral for an application comes from a social worker who can verify that you have exhausted all other resources  Sometimes if you can get the equipment discounted or lightly used volunteers of america will help out with the labor but you are responsible for all materials  Medicaid waivers paid for my home mods Milage will vary by state this was Montana  The virus caused an injury to your spinal cord did it not I think it would count Yeah I kinda figured that might be the case  Thought I d at least try to see what was out there  I don t work with a social worker or anything like that  I m just a dude in a wheelchair buying a house and putting my feelers out Greetings from your neighbor in the state to your east  I m assuming you have to be on Medicaid to get such a thing Unfortunately the foundation in question doesn t consider it an injury  It s unfortunate but it s their right to do so  The cause of my paralysis isn t listed specifically but it would fall under the category of other types they don t allow  This was from their website   Applicants must be paralyzed from a physical spinal cord injury to qualify for consideration People with paralysis due to a congenital or other health condition including  but not limited to  stroke traumatic brain injury spina bifida cerebral palsy multiple sclerosis post polio Guillain Barre  Strohl Syndrome ALS all other neuropathies and all other conditions causing disability are NOT eligible Headed Home From Spinal Cord RehabilitationMy injury is different but if I was to give someone advice that recently became in a similar situation as I am  c4 complete quadriplegic    Keep drinking water and still do your range of motion at least your legs and feet Besides that just be you   I was still a teenager when I became paralyzed so I continued doing what I was doing Going to school and partying So all that worlds best rehab shit went right out the door If I kept up with my range of motion and staying hydrated I wouldn t be in so much pain today   My injury was right before 9 11 so the whole nation was different when I got home from rehab I didn t stick out much With everything going on right now you probably won t stick out much either People will just be happy to see you  23 y o BIL just became a paraSpend some time with him Bonus points if he likes doing something like gaming that can be done in the hospital One of the saddest things about this part in his life is that he feels like he will never be happy again Just knowing that people will still want to hang out with him and have a good time is a great way to bring up his spirits  There is nothing you can do All hope is lost   Just kidding     I was 23 when I was paralyzed and had recently celebrated my second anniversary My wife did not know what to do or say but was kind patient and understanding She listened well Because of her support I was able to achieve phenomenal things in my life allowing me to enjoy life in a way that I would have not thought possible at the time   We will celebrate 42 years together in November   Just by listening and showing empathy you can really help Simply be there for him  One of the things that made a huge difference for me is to just treat him like normal It got really old when someone would talk to me with a slight tone of pity in their voice Yeah it sucks trust me I am PAINFULLY aware of that Just talk to me like normal some of the only times I felt more or less normal when I was still in the hospital was when friends would come to visit and we would talk joke play some instruments and watch TV movies like normal Be patient with his new physical limitations but just make sure you remember he s still the same person just in a chair now  I was 16 when I became a quad and I got exhausted pretty fast by people wanting to talk about everything I really hated when people thought they couldn t act normal around me A lot of people were afraid that I would be really sensitive about it but they didn t know what they could or couldn t say or do Just follow his lead and pay attention he ll show or tell you what he needs If he won t talk about his injury talk about other things If he wants to then talk about it   If he s really discouraged about his future or overly focused on walking  some new SCIs get so obsessed with walking again that they miss the other good stuff in life  I don t think there s anything wrong with trying to help him be more positive People with SCI regardless of level of function can participate in sports have families have jobs go to school travel pretty much whatever they want to do Shit is hard at first but we all figure it out eventually Right now he probably just needs people to be kind and patient and not afraid of doing something  wrong   It all depends Offer to help but don t be pushy  Something I went through was anger about my new situation and obviously I needed help now with normal day to day things but I didn t want to feel like a burden So my suggestion to you is to be patient with him and forgiving if he does get difficult  Point out that he will be able to take care of himself and be independent That helped me alot during the darkest days  If he doesn t have one already consider getting some people to throw in together for a Nintendo Switch  Anything to take his mind off of his situation and it s easily portable and multiplayer  if you get the more expensive one  if he s still in the hospital   If he has one get him a new game or some gift cards for the Nintendo shop  32 y o new paraplegic as well 6 months now As far as I can say so far I m

think it s helped to brighten both our days   if that makes any sense does encouragement get old after awhile or does it depend on the person  right now I m just listening   trying to give him the

I take a lot of painkillers including morphine and gabapentin but I honestly would say the best change I made to my life for the better is getting a decent sports therapist  Hello  I m a recent T12 burst fracture patient  8 weeks post op  with moderate nerve damage on my right side I have some very similar pain sensations that you are experiencing I was taking LOTS of oxy but have now been completely off for two weeks I was able to ween off of them with tylenol cbd drops and medical marijuana drops  legal in CA  I still definitely have pain but it is way more manageable and have just started seeing a PT specialized in  counter strain  which has helped me tremendously I recommend looking into it Also along with acupuncture and massage therapy I had to wear a TSLO brace which did help relax my muscles but severely increased my nerve pain in my right side I wish you the best of luck  I m really sorry to hear that you re in so much pain I hope you can find something that works for you Have you tried pregabalin I found that pregabalin helped me a lot more than gabapentin did  Hi I have tethered cords I am familiar with that type of pain There is research that a combination of ibuprofen and Tylenol can be more effective than other drugs Obviously you know your pain best I would say try for a second opinion but I am unsure of how it works in the UK    Also I had a tethered cord surgery that left me an incomplete paraplegic but mainly the loss of function that I have is what I lost before the surgery So to me getting rid of the burning pain was way worth it for my quality of life  I m a C 7 injury without bone involvement and have a Syrinx that formed in the scar tissue I have severe chronic pain as a result To treat that I have an implanted intrathecal pump that doses morphine into the spinal canal and a neurostimulator I use CBD for breakthrough pain   I ve also learned that those of us with chronic pain do not react to pain normally We tend to get a lot of pain that is due to our muscles knotting up  Guarding  areas where you experience pain A massage can leave my back pain free for 2 or 3 days I can t afford to do that very often though  Thank you so much I ve been referred to orthotics so I m hoping maybe they can recommend some kind of brace to help Thanks so much for taking the time to reply I appreciate it   Thank you so much for responding Is dry needling similar to acupuncture I ve been looking into trying it to se rig it helps Thank you so much I actually haven t  I m going to look into it today  Thanks so much for taking the time to respond   Hey Thanks for responding I haven t tried Pregablin actually  how was the weight gain on it That s another thing I have to be careful of too I ve heard a few horror stories  Thanks so much for taking time to reply I appreciate it  I ve found paracetamol and ibuprofen can help bridge the gap in between taking my next round of painkillers sometimes but not strong enough on their own unfortunately  Thanks so much I have been looking into sports massage as my knots are huge and so painful but they are ALL over my back  80 for 60 mins is not cheap either  T12 burst fractureI was in a TLSO for 4 months but after 3 I started taking it off in the shower I m 8 months out and am feeling better now Takes a long time to heal I am about 6 months out  Gave up the brace around 4 months  The pain and nerve problems are still there Well I also have a T12 burst fracture with a fusion T11 L1 so I d say similar I ve got an incomplete cord injury but certainly wasn t up and walking the day after surgery I was in my brace for about 5 6 months I think it was 13 years ago so not 100  on timings but injury was June fairly certain until November December   If you want to talk more about the psychological side of returning to your  normal  I m happy to talk privately I d say that stuff is all very specific to the individual though In terms of if I made it to a  normal  I d say 100  everyone I know that has gone through an injury like this it just becomes their normal eventually  Did you have surgery as well Or were you able to heal with just the braceThat is back pain wise  I did not have any nerve damageDid you have a fushion done as well Would love to chat about your injury and recoveryHiya  I don t know if I fit in here  I don t think anyone who is telling the truth can tell you it s for sure going to be okay   What I can tell you is that it is possible to build a life even a chronically excellent life amidst medical catastrophe  You are in a very scary situation and also it is manageable  You can get good care and even with a bad outcome you can make a good life    I have had a chain of medical catastrophes mostly to do with my spine and while there are some ways in which I have gotten lucky I have also really battled for that luck  Sometimes I have dialed sometimes I have broken even and sometimes I have had resounding success   It is valuable to be stubborn and inquisitive and skeptical  Ask all the questions until you understand the answers and feel confident in your understanding and then Check your understanding with a whole new person  Ask for help  Get lots of help queued up for you your mom and your sister  More help than seems reasonable   I am sorry that you are having to contend with this  It is indeed scary    Can someone who is kind of going through the same thing tell me it s going to be ok   If the surgery goes well  it should as it is a fairly standard procedure  it s very likely going to be ok  If I was in your shoes I wouldn t put the surgery off   My dad recently became paralyzed from the waist down due to stenosis and bone spurs in his spinal column He dove off his boat one day and the angle and impact of hitting the water caused one of the bone spurs to damage the spinal cord enough to cause total paralysis of the lower body He had excruciating neck and back pain for years and ignored the signs   They did surgery in his C1 C7 to help save the use of his upper body and now we are just waiting to see if the bruised compressed cord heals enough for him to get any function or mobility back in his lower body It s been 2 months and he has gotten sensation and feeling back into his legs and back   I do believe people with paralysis can still live a great fulfilling life but if you can prevent something that serious I m sure you d want to This situation truly made me believe that things happen for a reason even though it may not make sense to us in the moment I do believe the universe has a greater plan for us and we just need to trust the process  I am new to all of this and so maybe the information is not exactly correct I also want to point out that I am extremely lucky because of my injury location and I have full motor control with no loss of mobility I am expected to be able to return back to my life 100  Thats not a brag at all This whole injury has changed my look at life in general I just want to give my input on the surgery itself   AFTER saying all that I also want to point out that on September 25th I had a laminectomy and fusion of my C4 5 I broke my neck from an accident in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu on 9 11 the day before my 34th birthday I dont have the stenosis or anything like that I more just wanted to let you know that I had the surgery a few weeks back stayed overnight and went home the next day Today I am still wearing my brace and will for another few weeks but I feel almost pain free as long as I dont do any quick movements    Goodluck with it all and I am hoping for the best for you  Thank you You helped me calm down quite a bit I think seeing how fast my mom declined after a failed surgery and everything really had me freaked out Especially with my sister because I always knew I would have custody of her my entire life but there was never any question about whether or not I could physically take care of her in the future Now there s an unknown with my neck Just because my mom went down one road with her care that doesn t mean mine will follow the same suit I m still going to make a plan in case something does happen to me Like who would get my sister and ect   I feel like an idiot though because when I started my job a few years ago they offered LTD and I was like I m young and nothing bad will never happen to me I don t need that Well dang I have regrets Thank youI m so sorry about your dad    I m still probably going to wait until December or January for the surgery due to school unless something looks horrible with my next follow up I also have to get some ducks in a row in case the worst possible thing happens Especially with a special needs kid and everything  But I m not going to put it off for years or anything like that   Yeah pharmacy school was in my future but I m going to have to back that up and maybe look at something else Maybe biostats A nice desk job where I don t have to worry about dropping chemo or oxy Indwelling cath dangers Spinal nurse here we never recommend indwelling caths to be in long term due to erosion Have you ever talked with your doctor about a suprapubic catheter They re usually easier to manage compared an IDC and it removes the risk of urethral erosion With an SPC you could also then spigot it  not sure of the US term basically cap block it off  if you wanted to start trying intermittent caths again the opening also closes up very quickly so easily reversed should you decide to do solely intermittent  There s a list of reasons why IC is the first option compared to foley  fewer infections  needs to be done cleanly and still sometimes happens anyways  lower risk for bladder cancer  either way should probably start cancer screening after 5 10 years  the bladder can down shrink around the foley over time having a tube going through your genitals isn t great for sexuality over time urethra can potentially get wider over time risk of trauma if it gets pulled But foley can make things much more convenient for some If the leaking was the biggest problem make sure you tried different medications and or botox before resorting to a foley  I think Attaboy3 has a great list of cons I would add that indwelling catheters can also get plugged clogged and there is the risk of leaking the bag That being said I think a lot of it comes down to personal preference on which you would rather deal with I personally would prefer an indwelling catheter for ease of use even if I could intermittent cath  which I can t   They can make you bladder really small since it won t be holding any liquids anymore Making it very hard if you were to ever not want it anymore   I get Botox injections into my bladder My urologist recommended them to me and now I recommend to anyone My bladder holds decent amount with no leaks Just have to get the injections every 5 months or so  Did you try external condom cath  Wow my doctor and I never talked about SPC before but it looks super invasive I don t think I ll want to go down that route but thank you for your comment Oh wow no one discussed with me about all these before My hospital just told me to do this and that and I just followed Thank you for your comment and I think I ll switch back to IMC soon Oh Don t mind me asking but how come you can use intermittent cath Indwelling is really super convenient and I m so reluctant to change to intermittent  Nope I don t think my country has this  Singapore  Was checking various pharmacies before for the different types of cath and they only have foley or the normal tubes Cervical spinal contusionIf you had a fall you probably do have a contusion  if that s what the MRI showed MS would be doubtful if you hadn t had symptoms prior especially with only one lesion I don t know how long it s been but give it time to heal It s slooooooooow Sounds like you ve made some good progress already so that s encouraging It s ok for you to feel weird sensations when you move your body in certain ways  everyone s experience is different with what they perceive or feel from their injuries Don t expect to rush through recovery Best of luck and please post again if you have more questions  You know this just occurred to me but Craig hospital has a nurse advice line  You could also reach out to them and see if the nurses there  who tend to be pretty highly specialized in spinal cord injury and neuro rehab  can give you more information or direct you to other resources  Thank you for the response and the insight I really appreciate it Thank you for the recommendation but I am in Canada so not sure they would speak to me I will absolutely investigate it though I m a doctor working in rehabilitation medicine and I m part of an initiative that attempts to set standards for mental health support during both the acute phase admission and the follow up visits Do you guys have recommendations on how we could improve Talk more and more honestly about sex and sexual function  including fertility  after SCI  Relationship advice  So many of us have difficulties in our marriages relationships afterwards  I was 22 yo when I was injured my then fiance had just turned 21  We had NO idea how to deal with it  We could have really used advice on how to move through the grief together  He was the one who actually caused the car accident so there was a huge amount of baggage for us  We simply didn t have the tools to handle it even though we were deeply in love   And don t forget about the sex  Many of us experience severe changes in our sex lives and this can be extremely hard to accept for both men and women  Sex is the spice of life and of most relationships and it can be terrifying to think of losing it or having it severely reduced    I also hope you have female therapists on staff for the women to talk to  if they want   I m aware that on average we only make up about 20  of SCIs but don t forget about us  There is a lot of good information here so I will give you my memory from 23 years ago my anniversary being yesterday My concern was discussion of fertility it was about one sentence and couldn t have been more awkward if it was with a sanitation engineer rather than my father or a physician I was asked only once if preserving some DNA was interesting to me at the age of 16 in front of far too many people to feel confident about giving an honest answer The physicality of that aspect of life was also omitted but another commenter has spoke to that so I will leave it therefore this topic   The other thing that bothered me at the time was the endless worst case scenario talk I recognized the level of my injury But on the night that I arrived at the hospital that would treat my broken neck the neurosurgeon resident one is still working in this city I have seen not that long ago and told my parents that what you see is what you get Well neurologically I recovered a lot from that And obviously being in rehabilitation you know that when taught well a person can do a lot with very little function Even the social worker assigned to me felt like she was more interested in getting me to cry than to work on the logistics of renovating my parents house so I could return home when I was done at the hospital getting me measured for a wheelchair and getting that thing ordered and all the other actionable answers to her questions of what I would like to think about   Obviously depression is a large factor after a traumatic injury but my follow through is what it always had been in my short 16 years My goals were to work through my emotions with the people that I trusted and get the ball rolling again so I could get back to whatever my life is going to look like Laying in bed crying was not going to make things better any faster Accomplishing something feeling like work is being done towards getting me back to Independence and going home is what I needed and she absolutely never got that   Those were inpatient situations After being discharged and in a city 250 km away there was virtually no follow up Spinal Cord Injury Saskatchewan formerly Canadian Paraplegic Association   Saskatchewan chapter had peer support programs in place but were incredibly limited at the time They are slightly better now but not much And type of mental health care in our Province and country is abysmal to say the least So any work you could do on that front as to improve western medicine best practices would be fantastic   I hope that this helped out and that your work goes very well Check in with us once you have something else to ask or share These are the types of posts I find fulfilling to contribute to  One more thing just to echo u nonnumousetail  I had a similar experience in my rehab regarding women s sex ed  I was excited when sex ed day came around only to be told along with the other women in rehab that the class was only for the men  Us women were given a pamphlet on fertility and pregnancy and something about how cuddling and holding hands were still important  The word  orgasm  wasn t even mentioned anywhere in it   Nothing else  I was shocked  I felt like my sexuality meant nothing  it wasn t even important enough to warrant a few minutes of class time  But in my traumatized and weakened state I was in no place to fight back  I feel myself wanting to cry just remembering it   Talk to us about orgasms clitoral and G spot  mine switched post SCI  and the percentage of women who are able to orgasm  Modified sex toys for those of us with limited hand function  Lubrication  Positioning  Vaginal atrophy and ways to deal with it  Possible AD  Safe sex still being important  Making good choices even though our self esteem may be shot Visual signs of STDs and vaginal infections for those of us with loss of genital sensation  Devotees  wheelchair fetishists    pros and cons   If possible   have a few of your previous patients come in and talk real life strategies with people with new injuries   Involve the families in your discussions During my other half s hospitalization I was never involved in discussions about what our life was going to look like moving forward While the injury is obviously devastating to the patient it s also a huge adjustment to their spouses and families It would have been such an eye opening experience to talk to a couple that had gone through what we were experiencing at that time   Good luck on your project It s so needed and will help so many people  P S Do you have a link to your program or could you tell us about the areas you already cover  It s hard to see where you should improve if we don t know what you re already doing  I had  successfully  medicated mental health issues when I was injured and I also sustained a TBI  It was a battle to continue to receive mental health meds while in acute care the PM R docs didn t know discuss disclose interactions between the psych meds I was on and the opiates and gabapentin pregabalin they enthusiastically prescribed  It was deeply frustrating  Referrals from inpatient   outpatient case management for mental health care and for TBI followup have been extremely challenging to obtain and inaccurate  Please please please do this No one talked to us at all about sex and fertility Everything we found out was from google and the WAGS support group   this  Its literally different for everyone and no patient wants to talk about it Yes I totally agree with this We actually had SCI classes in Rehab when I was in the hospital and one of the classes was on sex education after injury The only information they had for women was  you can still get pregnant don t worry   And then the rest of the hour was about how guys can still get it up and what tools they might be able to use   Like  I don t want to get pregnant I want to know what I might expect out of sex going forward Like should I just assume that I need extra lube Is there a risk of autonomic dysreflexia during sex What do I need to be cautious about Is there a chance that I could ever experience an orgasm again   I have no fucking idea but I do know about all the ways SCI guys can still have one So don t worry it s all good  sI love your answer Thank you I went to two different facilities  both very highly rated  one after the initial injury and the other two years later after a surgery impacted my function   The first facility had many many many hours of lovely videos to watch while you lay in bed  Many  Well produced nicely written attractively cast  And watching those videos counted as  education  which freed up nurses OTs and PTs to provide care and therapies explained the docs  But videos don t give family experience providing care don t provide any opportunities for asking questions and they don t teach injured folks how to describe and ask for what they need I left that world famous hospital terrified and desperate and incompetent   Facility two had small group classes for the injured their SOs and families on things like how to get up off the floor when you fall  advocating for yourself when hospitalized  cleaning catheters and bop tools  bleach solution vs vinegar solution  how to make your bowel program not take three hours  sexuality and sex workers and devotees  I left feeling more competent less frightened and more optimistic than since before the initial injury We are still in the baby stages so i don t have a link We are rehab doctors nurses psychologists and psychiatrists from centers around the country trying to figure out what we could be doing better   We think that in the same way that there s a routine for when to check your kidneys there should be a routine for mental health check ups screening for depression anxiety and substance abuse As well as getting you better prepared for what happens when you leave the hospital after your rehab goals are achieved   We are coming up with a list of suggestions and hopefully management will enforce some of them It might be simple things like staff and patient education or questions to ask when you come for your follow up And I really hope we can do decent job   AdviceI was depressed before and I m still depressed So for me the feeling hasn t changed I ve been fighting for disability will no success Oh I recieved nerve damage during surgery nearly 8 years ago I just had my second surgery 3 months ago and I m still sore My legs constantly tingle and my muscles twitch all the time I had to learn how to walk again after my first surgery Great that I can walk but I can t do it for long I can t sit for too long either   You re right It s not just a physical thing I ll add onto your advice No matter how bad it is for you someone out there has it worse and they re making it work That means you can too You control your happiness and all it takes is finding one thing Even the smallest thing Find that thing and before long you ll find another and another Just never lose hope and never give up You made it this far you can make it the rest of the way  Something that often happens to people with SCI especially those of us who acquired our injuries suddenly is we deal with PTSD  This can show up in other more subtle ways than the ones we see in the movies    nightmares and flashbacks  Some of these other ways can include    Emotional numbing  difficulty feeling more intense emotions positive or negative    Short temper Irritability   Trouble focusing   Memory issues   Anxiety Increased startle response   Depersonalization  feeling  out of yourself  or experiencing your actions or thoughts from a distance  chronic or acute episodes     Social isolation   Mistrust of others  It s taken me a long time    20 years    to get help for my own PTSD  I m seeing a therapist that specializes in trauma and EMDR  My personality changed after my car accident and I always blamed it on you know becoming paralyzed and being in physical pain and being outcast by society  While all these things contributed to my state of mind PTSD has also had a big hand in it and I m just now admitting finding out how much  I hope by listing the lesser known symptoms above I can maybe help someone else who s been stuck just like I ve been for so many years    Because for many of us simply telling ourselves to get better isn t enough  Knowing what to do isn t the same as being able to do it especially when it comes to mental health  The struggle is real Your attitude really is everything  You have to allow yourself to have some bad days Puts all the good ones in perspective Grief is absolutely a lifelong process  It s all a process    Sometimes I even say out loud to myself  no matter what has happened the most important and powerful things of myself remain   my voice my mind  I can   still   be in control of my thoughts No matter what else has been stripped    The best piece of advice I can ever give is to never let it all bottle up Talk it out write it out ride it out Keep your mind as free as you can    Happy to see you recognize the importance of mental health Good vibes to all of you  My rock bottom was 2 3 years after my injury  6y now  Don t let yourself devolve I went full on hoarders mess while not addressing my popped air bladder for my wheelchair seat The latter led to a stage 4 pressure sore and about a year in full bedrest  If could start a new hobby that would make you living in today Maybe meet new people also that don t remind you of your old self   Have to mentioned that Vitamin D St John Hort and exercise help a lot with mild depression  That is really rough    I was injured early in life  at 6 months old  so can t actually remember it or anything before it and therefore don t really have the same issue   That said I didn t fully accept my injury until I was in my mid 20s so I spent a lot of time just denying it was even an issue which was definitely not healthy and kept me from living my life to the fullest  Full disclosure I am currently on bedrest in hospital with a pressure sore other bladder complications and orthopaedic surgery Yet I am at the happiest point since my injury 10 years on Happy about my life considering relationships and moving to a suitable accommodation and fully employed I m only on lowest dose of antidepressants it s purely for anxiety of hospital You are only two years in I had severe depression and PTSD and wasn t taking any antidepressants First thing I did was to get over relationships and next was to get thinking of what is next and that was employment Listening to western Buddhist lectures Jack Kornfield for example really helped my mental health with something to focus on like a purpose finding hobbies that I could do without needing assistance YMMV  I am having all of the symptoms listed but aren t they all also depression symptoms Every day when feeling the emotional numbness I think less of myself for just not feeling love and compasion towards overs  I think I am a bad person and it makes me sad but I find theres nothing I can do Really bad looking mri spinal cord is completely pinched off But I feel like I m improving with much less moderate pain Urgent surgery needed This is a question to discuss with your surgeon No one here can give you medical opinions  Considering this is a decision that could impact your mobility for the rest of your life please don t take advice from the internet Every SCI is different so what works for one person may not work for another even if they have similar injuries   Talk to your surgeon get a second opinion if you feel it s necessary but leave the advice for this up to medical professionals who ve actually seen your full case  Familiarize yourself with the red flags of cauda equina syndrome a rare disorder that requires immediate emergency attention No one can give you medical advice here but I agree that you should do some reading about cauda equina syndrome and talk to your surgeon GP consultant about it I have cauda equina where my disk slipped into my spinal cord  I had emergency surgery from one of the top hospitals in the country but nearly four years on I still have paralysis in my left leg walk with crutches and use intermittent self catheterisation   I was in quite a lot of pain until my disk slipped and then I had no feeling from the waist down  I m not suggesting that s what happening in your case just saying that pain isn t always a good indicator   Also if you notice any changes in your bladder control go to a hospital immediately  that s often one of the first signs of cauda equina  I d have surgery if you have ongoing neurological impairment due to compression of spinal cord  appreciate you taking the time to write your responseI don t think I have any symptoms of neurological deficit anymore and will be delaying if not declining surgeryC1 C3 plate and fusion outlookI have my skull C3 fused and was also 24 when injured What you ll notice the most is the limited range of motion looking left right and up I can look down just fine I can still look the other ways as well but it s limited You ll get used to it and will learn to turn your whole body to talk to someone or sit at the end of the dinner table and angle your seat What bothers me the most is muscle pain from the muscles I m not using anymore The get so tight and it feels like all I wanna do is move it when I can t So when that happens I have one of those beaded neck pillows I throw in the microwave because heat helps Sleeping might be different too I can t sleep on my stomach anymore because my head doesn t turn enough so I can breathe PT helped so much with pain and cramps   As for work I have no idea how much your job will depend on neck motion I was a flight attendant before my injury but haven t made it back to work because when I was finally ready covid happened I spent 2 5 years recovering from my accident so I guess I could wait a little longer lol   I m not quite sure how different your experience will be since your skull won t be fused but I imagine you ll have a lot of the same feelings I m also the only person I know who has my exact fusion  or anything close to it for that matter  so experiences could definitely vary  I have C1 C7 fused Injury and surgery happened when I was 28 I m 33 now and was able to return to work in less than 6 months I have had to adapt to more of a desk job but am able to still get out in the field to do estimates and outside sales I work in cleaning and restoration so I m not really climbing ladders to do windows or boarding up buildings after fires   Pain wise I deal with some nerve pain in my right shoulder daily and my legs twitch sometimes  especially at night when I m trying to get to sleep   I m fused from C2 T1 I can do physical labor but I pay for it over the next few days An example is yard work If I spend the day mowing edging and trimming my arms are numb and tingly for about 2 days The pain is difficult but I can work through it  No kidding not to many people have anything above a c3 fused let alone skull included Glad your not doing to bad asides from some muscle tightness   So you haven t had any numbness or shooting pain in different areas Also were you able to get disability while recovering Asides from surgery my next biggest fear is being able to keep my family afloat in the recovery time My right shoulder is worse then my neck right now If my elbow goes anywhere near close to height of shoulder It feels like someone hit that preasure point all the way up through my neck I got a high pain tolerance but it makes even me wanna drop what ever I m holding and lay down Aside from my right shoulder and spasms I get numb feet but that s about it pretty surgery   1 7 sounds like hell how much mobility or the neck do you still have there telling me I ll be around 50  How long are you able to sit still without shuffling Though its painful I m glad your able to do what you need to get done Feeling trapped the couch is my biggest fear I ve always been a gogo type of guy   How long did it take you to recovery from your surgery Book tipsHow do you mean  Actually I was just guessing but Christopher Reeve has actually written a couple books about his experience with SCI His first book is called   Still Me  https   www amazon com s k still me christopher reeve i stripbooks crid GK062B2I9IVB sprefix Still me 2Cstripbooks 2C162 ref nb_sb_ss_i_4_8   and his second book is called   Nothing Is Impossible  https   www goodreads com book show 580285 Nothing_Is_Impossible    Also there s   Across The Street From Hell  https   www amazon com Across Street Hell Spinal Recovery dp 0615643450   by Mark Anthony Hall and one more I found was cleverly titled   How I Roll  https   www amazon com How Roll After Spinal Injury dp 0982946171   by J Bryant Neville   Hope these are what you re looking for At least one of the Christopher Reeve autobiographies were available in audiobook as well    I m interested in first person accounts from people living with SCI   Do you have any specific questions   I think like if say Christopher Reeve wrote a book about his experience with SCI Exactly what I was looking for Thanks A friend of the family was diagnosed C4 complete 11 months ago   I am just trying to understand more of the psychological aspects of his injury from his point of view Lower back pain during heavy squat deleted  It could be tons of things from a sprain to something severe Contact your GP rest and ice and familiarize yourself with the red flags of cauda equina syndrome so you know if emergency intervention is needed  Thank you Update  I no longer have urinary accidents  Oxybutynin Glad to hear I ve been using oxybutynin for the same reason as you for about 20 years It s worked great I self catch every 4 or 5 hours Sometimes longer depending on what I ve drank Only time things change are when I drink way too much caffeine or go out for a heavy night of drinking alcohol But that can be said for any non sci person  I tried that back in December It definitely works The dry mouth and constipation were immediate and so terrible so I stopped taking it after 4 days I m glad it works for you and the side effects don t bother you I d honestly rather have an accident than deal with those side effects  That s awesome Try myrbetriq with it I don t take oxybutynin anymore because it works so well and doesn t give me dry mouth I get Botox injections every 6 months and combine it with myrbetriq Its a game changer I average about 500 700cc per cath  I ve begun having positional leaking in last 2 3 months very stressful I will try Oxybutynin hopefully it help Any side effects I need to be aware of  Does Oxybutynin get your little guy chubby I if i remember correctly that use to happen until i stopped taking it  That s awesome I take Darifenacin 15mg daily and it gets me max 300 400 cc between caths And the leakage depends on situations If it is raining  even without much liquid intake it starts leaking Accidents are a daily occurence After your post I m inclined to try Oxybutynin If you don t mind me asking what level injury are you and how long since your injury I m T4 and it s been 5 years since my accident  Good for you  I certainly hope you get long term success  Is oxybutynin available OTC or must it be prescribed  Does it have problematic side effects  I am happy for you I have been in a chair for 27 years and those medications work for a bit and then stop working as well as they did I had accidents all the time at night Ever since I got my medical marijuana card and vape at night before bed I rarely have an accident during the night It has changed my life Once you start medicating before bed consistently it works during the day too Just another alternative to think about I still take vesacare on top of using the medical marijuana Also the Botox works really really well I loved mine I just had a bad allergic reaction to it so I can t do it But another option  Not trying to change your mind but food for thought  Been taking it for over 20 yrs had the same side effect issues in the beginning but they faded over a short period of time I sure I m preaching to the choir but skin cleanliness is super important for many reasons Prevent against skin breakdowns as well as dealing with the smell and not always carrying a change of clothes if you re working planning to work I have a friend who does bladder Botox injections and they work great for him  good luckSame  Although I take some solfenicin as well Do you ever have accidents How expensive is all that So far I ve only experienced dry mouth Try myrbetriq with oxybutynin T6 and it s also been 5 years for me Bladder leaking while lying downI ve been having a lots of positional leakage problems in past months Going to see a urologist and discuss some things people here mentioned primarily getting s botox injection taking Myrbetriq or oxybutynin   Leakage is so frustrating I hate having to change that often during the day having to wash my bed sheets I m always on a look out checking my pants all the time just really really anxious Really hope one of this solutions or combination can help  Leaking or any change in your bladder should warrant a visit to your urologist The pressure is getting high and that constant high pressure is no good on your bladder health   Lying down puts more pressure on your bladder from gravity and if it isn t coming out then it can back up into your kidneys which will result in permanent damage and a trip to the hospital   Go see a sci urologist  Online meetupsMy local Spinal Cord Support Group does twice monthly zoom meetings I haven t attended since May but they still go on It s a great group of people with quite a bit of knowledge of SCIs   Edit  He is more than welcome Let me know and I will dm you the info  I don t know of any place to suggest but I think making an online presence in areas of the net that he s interested in might be helpful For instance I follow this YouTube personality and she has started a discord group and they use zoom to interact I m thinking of joining for the same reason as your uncle I hope that helps a little bit  I work for a spinal cord injury charity and we have online zoom meetings and will be returning to face to face meet ups when we can  Shared adventures org is wonderful The founder Foster Anderson has been an eager friend to help the newly disabled as he s been very active and productive in that situation for over 40 years after a motorcycle injury He s easy to talk to if you want to shoot him a text from the website  Sharedadventures org mentioned above has a monthly activity calendar lots of online stuff   https   www sharedadventures org our adventures events activities  Check out care cure community It s more of a forum but it had a lot of information and users experience that helped me comprehend my injury a lot deeper Physically and mentally  The spinal cord injuries discord is a good place to get in contact with people going through similar things COVID SUCKS let s start with that It has caused many most support recreational social groups to shut down or move to Zoom meetings   A silver lining for some who may not have been close to a group or didn t have the opportunity to travel for in person meetings is that many support groups now meet via zoom as others have mentioned   If he is looking to talk with folks who are in the same area state as he is this map provides contact information for support groups around the country and is broken down by state then county   https   www spinalcord com spinal cord injury support groups map  https   www spinalcord com spinal cord injury support groups map   The organizers and other information changes from time to time so be sure to call email the organizer about the specifics   If he happens to be in South Carolina  or near there  this organization has done a great job responding to COVID and has many different groups and they are super nice so i m sure they would be interested in hearing form someone who isn t in SC  https   scspinalcord org peer support breeze peer support groups  https   scspinalcord org peer support breeze peer support groups    Facebook also has a bunch of groups he can join and I believe they sometimes have subgroups with zoom meetings just have to go in and search for what you are looking for For example this group has about 8k members  https   www facebook com

technology before but having a lot of trouble mastering voice commands DM me if you think your uncle might like to talk to him We live near Boston Thank you he isn t able to type and he is older so I don t think he likes to do too much on YouTube is communities like that tho he would probably enjoy it  so he s looking for video meetups I think hopefully his assistant can help set him up in a zoom

3Awesome thanks Thanks Thank you Thanks this is great Psychedelics Spinal fluid leaking after surgery They went in through the front of my neck for my fusion but when I had a baclofen pump installed they said it was common for spinal fluid to leak enough to stain the sheets for the first few days Sure enough  Freaked me the fuck out Their advice was to drink plenty of fluids and limit sitting up if it caused headaches It did   Try not to freak out  I had a slow CSF leak that left me with a largish pseudomeningocele after a spinal surgery  Because I was able to tolerate the headaches etc with caffeine and positioning they monitored me pretty closely but didn t do anything about it and eventually the dura healed up and all the CSF reabsorbed   I have not but I had a C2 T1 laminectomy with fusion Best of luck to him It s not going to be easy going forward  7 weeks seems like a long time Does he have a  massive  headache which would indicate a CSF leak  Thanks He had a drain initially to help the fluids in the hospital but it s all healed now and just looks like it s a puffy bubble Thank you You are always super helpful with my questions I really do appreciate it His is almost the size of a tennis ball Does that seem out of the ordinary Thanks Sounds like a similar level of injury to yours    He got 2 weeks in the hospital and a whopping 3 5 weeks in rehab before coming home He started to get more and more sensation in his feet legs and back We are hoping it might be a sign that things are firing back up but of course you never know Reading some of your posts his issue was also due to stenosis over the years He had bone spurs growing in his spinal canal and we think one bruised injured the cord really bad towards the middle of his back I believe the doctor did the operation in his neck mostly to preserve his upper body function No no huge headache I am wondering if it s just slowly leaking and has now caused this big bubble I saw him today after no seeing him for a few days and it is definitely bigger I am wondering if a wound care nurse could help exoskeletonI tried the ReWalk it is good as a physical therapy device but not practical for every day use in getting around  I used an Indigo  sp   while in therapy 100  not practical for  everyday use  but I think it was better for kind of rewiring the brain to remember how to step walk I m ambulatory now with the use of crutches but I m incomplete so it s hard to say what would ve happened with or without it  I ve tried three types of exoskeleton and only the Rewalk and Indigo were approved for use outside a therapy setting Regardless each had positive and negative aspects but getting up and moving helped me a lot in my progress I m lucky I was exposed to them and great PT s to help me on a path to a better life  I m a PT and this is exactly my experience I want to know all positive and negative aspects of this exosceletonI want to know all positive and negative aspects of this exosceletonPLease explane me all positive and negative aspects of those exosceletonsWheelchair tiresSchwalbe makes their marathon plus tyre in a wheelchair size with non   marking black tread also has reflective sidewalls and excellent puncture resistance  Mine just came with my chair but I imagine if you needed a replacement a bike shop could help I use the solid insert in what I think are shadow rims I get the regular primo everyday tires  25 540 I get them from Sportaid They last about 4 months before the tread is gone  I use Spinergy wheels https   www spinergy com and have a set of extra wheels that came with my chair that was scripted for me I prefer my Spinergy SLX wheels as I have a special side grip on it for my wrists But they re expensive and cost about 1 200usd  Marathon Plus and I m probably on my 8 or 9th set Buy them online and get the local bike shop to fit them for me as I use Spinergy Lx wheels and it s a tight fit   https   www schwalbe com en tour reader marathon plus yup Schwalbe marathon plus for me too I use Schwalbe tires like a lot of others There s basically 3 ways I can go about getting them   1    National Seating   Mobility   To go this route you set up an appointment and they will make an assessment for what you need From there they contact your insurance to charge them and then order them It takes about 6 8 weeks for them to arrive and when they do they ll set you up with a second appointment to come in and put them on When you do it this way they will also look at your chair and order any other parts that need replacing i e  casters axles brakes etc   2   Local Bike Shop   This route is a lot faster but you pay out of pocket The first time I did it this way I just went in they figured out what size I needed  It helps if you already know but they ll double check either way  and then they ordered it This only took about a week tops If you re real lucky they will have them in stock The price out of pocket depends on size and tread etc but I pay between  60 and  80  3    Ordering Online   This is my least favorite way since you have no way to make sure you re getting the right tire You need to know exactly what size you need and you have to put them in yourself which is not easy at all or you can ask your local bike shop to help you This takes about 6 8 weeks and the out of pocket cost is usually between  60 to  80 but you also pay shipping which can be expensive and varies greatly depending on where you are and where you re ordering from After all that you could get them and they may not be the right size width or tread  It s almost impossible to return them for a replacement let alone trying to get a refund   My favorite and recommended way for just getting tires alone is your local bike shop It s fast less expensive and the people there are always super helpful and friendly and they often have ordered tires for wheelchairs in the past so they have a bit of experience with it   Hope this helps good luck  I have used Schwalbe Kenda Primo  I haven t done a study to compare cost to durability but they all seem about the same   you get what you pay for if durability and service are your interest I live in Minnesota found the best winter tires ever On amazon for like 20  Don t let the wheelchair manufactures fool you If your looking to save money mountain bike tires are the same damn thing Lol Only thing I notice with these tread filled masterpiece of tires is the fo leave more black on your hands and sone kinds of floors  Def worth the trade to plow thru snow in the winter   https   www passionatepeople invacare eu com wheelchair wheels   https   www passionatepeople invacare eu com wheelchair wheels    Here is an article I found regarding different wheelchairs tires Hope this helps  I also use these Anyone else have muscle spasms when they re cold My spasms are much worse in the cold I m pretty sure my doctor said that s very common so your body isn t weird  I have nerve damage from a botched surgery about 7 years ago and I have muscle spasms on my left side The damage affects me from the waist down btw I ve never noticed temperature causing them It will make them more intense Mine typically start whenever I start getting really tired They aren t painful but they are really bothersome Sometimes my leg will stretch out and others it will tense up like a Charlie horse When it gets going cool air does intensify things Then again anything that touches my leg will My legs constantly tingle and I get mixed signals about things from my legs I can t tell the difference in temperature change sometimes pressure causes pain and pain causes pressure smooth things feel sticky and I have hypersensitive reflexes Tap my knee and I kick like a horse   Have you ever had an EMG or been diagnosed with nerve damage That s what this makes me think of I d find neurosurgeon that you trust and go talk with them  I do right when I finish showering I get bad cold chills after drying off and then my spasms tend to kick in a bit  I have something very similar to spina bifida and yes from my defect down  to my toes  all spasms when I m cold stressed overtired or in pain  Yep T8 complete and cold sends pain and spasms through the roof  Pretty normal your body is reacting in the absence of instruction from your body  It doesn t have the full connection to the brain to let it know it is over reacting  Slightly related prior to my injury tickling my feet would give no reaction but now makes my feet jump and twitch like crazy No spasms but cold weather just makes my body feel horrible in general  I m C4 not spasm so much but my muscle tone goes through the roof when cold and I get so tight I can t hardly move I hate winter  I ve had an SCI for 4  years but for the first time I feel limited  Sex related 13 year C4 5 Walking Incomplete Quad here   I m not an expert by any means but simply drawing from experience It sounds like she feels insecure because she isn t getting the  normal  feedback or response from pleasing her partner   I started dating right out of rehab and I couldn t orgasm for 29 months post injury 13 years later it s still a 1 in 10 chance that I ll have one during sex I ve always expressed to and educated my partners that it is a result of the injury but still incredibly pleasurable Some partners weren t affected at all and took it as a challenge and others simply felt like they failed    Ultimately insecurities play a huge role in sex as much as it does in other aspects of life   Just like you can t make someone happy in life if they aren t choosing to be happy in life themselves the same goes for someone s happiness in the bedroom   In this scenario there really isn t anything you can do until she s secure in herself and truly understands that you are sexually satisfied Then and only then will she be able to focus on enjoying herself   I hope you can both find a way of exploring her fears and giving her the confidence and reassurance that you re enjoying every aspect of your sex life  Sorry you re struggling These limitations are a reality we all must face at some point with this injury The only thing you can do is give it your best and communicate At the end of the day if you guys aren t compatible then there s not much else you can do but move on to someone one more compatible  I m in her shoes And i sort of know where she s coming from From the sounds of it don t put and pressure on you It s a her thing She needs to be ok with her self and confident with her self Communication is key you guys just need to be a lot more open and have honest frank conversations And perhaps a little bit more creative getting to know each other s body s  It also may just not be right for the both of you and it ll be a bit pants for a bit but that just means there s someone else out there for you It doesn t sound like you have a hard time meeting people and are fairly outgoing  I think for her as a female us growing up and our most sexual experiences guys couldn t give a toss about us and our pleasure  thanks porn  The hardest thing for me to adapt was understanding how much pleasure he took from him making me enjoy myself Very few guys in reality able bodied or not actually do that  Good luck  Appreciate you opening up I understand where you re coming from and have felt the same way At the end of the day you have to remember that you offer her things that other people can t offer her Your resilience and strength  although sounds cheesy  is something that she will not be able to find another man who may sexually satisfied There are gives and takes in relationships and I know it sucks to feel limited but if you can build awareness about the other parts of her life you are improving it might help you feel better Shit sucks man but everything is a choice I talked with my g f and we both are echoing many of the other comments here   It is her problem not yours  That doesn t mean she is a bad person  It just means that at this point in her life she isn t ready to be in a relationship where sex isn t  normal   She may never be ready for that    I personally have had comments from women like  If you don t orgasm then what is the point of sex    I knew right then that a relationship with that person wouldn t work   You mentioned that your lady doesn t like trying new different things in bed because it is the one time when she doesn t want to think  That is a HUGE red flag to me   If she really wanted things to work out with you she would be excited to try different things because that would help the relationship succeed   My girlfriend and I are very open in terms of communication in the bedroom and that is   crucial   for any relationship but especially one in which a person has a spinal cord injury   I flat out tell her either before or during sex  I don t know if this will work but I d like to try      and she says  We ll alright let s give it a go  If it doesn t work we can try something else    The most important thing is that she is caring and understanding regarding everything in terms of my sexual function ability and because of that we always feel connected and lovey even if for example my dick won t go up   and that DOES happen once in a while but I have a tongue and I have fingers so     p  Interestingly enough though when I m having erection issues my lady doesn t mind at all because that means she gets to try to  snake charm  him as she calls it   Most of the time she is successful  Sometimes she isn t but she understands that it is a me thing not a her thing    The bottom line is that we enjoy EVERYTHING we do regardless of what it is   It sounds like your s o is overthinking things  which is exactly what she said she didn t want to do    That isn t going to change overnight and it may never change  Then again it may   I do believe that you two need a break from your relationship  If it is meant to be it is meant to be  If not there are so many other fishies out there and most dolphinitely one of them will click with you in ALL aspects of the relationship  I went the first 6 8 years after injury without orgasm or ejaculation Depending on your injury level and what not it s totally possible  I found a forum of guys using a tens unit to ejaculate Have been using that ever sense and its worked wonders for me  Between using tri mix for Ed that and an intimate rider Along with other various things in my adult toy box I d say I ve gotten back to having a pretty normal sex life   Just saying don t give up until you have tried all options A lot of guys use vibrators such as hitachi wands They make a medical vibrator just for people with SCI called the a ferticare medical vibrator   My girlfriend I had when I was injured was the same way your talking and it didn t work out If only she could see what I m capable of now   I m a new girlfriend to a T7 complete para He s had a second injury that made it so he needs a lot of medication to get erect And even then it doesn t get super hard and goes away quickly Mostly we do other types of sex   I had a meltdown the other day after we tried regular sex again because it just seemed weird But after my bf held me and talked to me I figured out it was because he had been too mechanical and practical I needed some romance to help me forget that he can t feel it and all the focus is on me I needed romantic kissing and touching to bring me into the moment so I could just enjoy the intimacy He s really funny and now he gets extra dripping wet romantic when he wants to turn me on Try going slow and romantic and getting her so lost in the mood that she forgets about the medical aspect of what you re doing For some women like myself the focus of sex has always been getting the man off With the focus now completely on my pleasure it s taken some romance to make sure I don t get self conscious and instead actually enjoy being able to direct sex to my pleasure  My BF is c5 6 complete 32 yrs post injury Like a couple of the other comments the hardest weirdest thing was the fact that the focus was on me especially as previously my aim was to take care of my partner s needs never my own I will admit that it does upset me a bit that I can t give back to him in that way   I found it easy to change what my definition of sex is especially when he explained to me what he mentally gets out of it I was never adventurous in that way until I met him but now we both come up with new things to try and different ways of doing things to try and keep it interesting for both of us I discovered that I quite like being tied up giving him control that we both enjoy    If you have or decide to get a ferticare vibrator make sure she has a go   The possible planning lack of spontaneity isn t something that bothers me much but I can understand how it might be an issue for others   I think without proper honest communication and openness things will continue as they are It s sounds to me that it s her who needs to communicate more  You could suggest different toys to try and different ways to use them and do things Being creative that way definitely makes things more exciting for us You could also maybe try to surprise her by planning ahead to be as ready as you can be if possible  if he knows I m not in pain mine will take his blue ones and make sure he caths right before bed   But some people can t or won t change unfortunately for different reasons I really hope things work out for you    I have some thoughts on this but I would like to get my girlfriend s input before I say anything else    It is after midnight here so I will ask her tomorrow morning and then post another reply   Sounds like she isn t really completely comfortable with the situation set How do you feel about smoking weed Weed actually makes sex much more physically enjoyable for me That could be helpful got you both I still haven t figured any way for me to orgasm yet It s been over 4 years I don t really get physical pleasure  at least in my penis  from sex so it s all mental and feels good to please them I do have some physical pleasure from my nipples after my injury and she enjoys playing with them so she tries to make sure I am feeling good too but I never get that big release like before my injury Thanks for the response The ol tongue and fingers is what I feel I had mastered in the past but she doesn t like either of those things for some reason so it s like I had to start over lol Those were my go to Thanks for sharing how things have worked for you I will try to talk to her more about it I have a tens unit but I don t know how to use it down there Could you give me some info about that I have some strong vibrators but haven t had any success with them Thanks for sharingI host a party every year called happy cripple day to celebrate the day of my injury Slightly odd I guess but we love it We also strongly encourage all attendees to wear these t shirts Thought some of you might at the very least be entertained by them For  0 guess how I injured myself this is AMAZING man   Breakdancing under a tree  Aww I want a personalized injury shirt now  This is awesome I would wear it I d just trade a cliff for the tree and change the date  Very nice  I call my injury day snapping day  I also fell out of a tree and broke my back These images are great Thank you for sharing  Falling off a tree  Thanks man There are also a series of bad taste cakes that are made each year Including a pretty huge chair cake https   imgur com wQQsdJe You win  0In an argument with my friend How happy would you say you are in your day to day life It s a constant cycling spiral According the Dr  s I don t have bi polar but it honestly feels like that sometimes   I never have a day without pain I wake up from it and it exhausts me to bed However imo it s more frustrating not knowing what exactly sets my back off I ll have one day where I ll feel up for doing some chores and after I get them done I pass out I ll wake up the next day in severe pain or sometimes I wake up the next day not doing that much worse   There s no rhyme or reason to my pain Or better put if I don t constantly keep up on trying to keep it in shape and cater to it I pay a very dear price It s like having a 2 yr old crying baby that you need to care for constantly   So it s a hard question to answer I have days where I feel like I can t take it anymore only to have a week later a weekend where I actually felt social and like I could be the person I was before my injury   It s a very hard life to stabilize with I guess is the main point I m saying so your question imo from my experience is a hard one to answer   Tbh though I definitely deep down have a love for life My chronic pain has taught me empathy compassion understanding  it s pushed me to do and be things I never thought I could or would be ok being It s a trip for sure  A total mind bender but you can learn to  ride the waves  after awhile imo   Sorry that answer s all over the place but that s the best I can do Have a good one    You could research something called the Disability Paradox This is a relatively common phenomenon that people that do no have disabilities will wrongly think that people with disabilities have a low quality of life while in most research the majority of people with disabilities report having a good or excellent quality of life Basically disability has less of an impact on your happiness than people that don t have them expect This comes from the fact that people s expectations get adjusted Happiness according to a lot of research relating to disability and in general is mostly a product of their social relationships their sense of fulfilment and personal attitudes Of course disability can have an impact   In short your friend is wrong and you are right I have a spinal cord injury and know many people who do We have relationships friends jobs play sports etc It is true that a disability can make some of these things harder but that is not our fault it is society s In general people with disabilities have a lot of resilience since we live in a world that is not adapted to us so we are able to deal with things being more difficult   If feel like your friend has a little lack of imagination which in my opinion is probably more of a disability than mine  I d say I m pretty happy I m lucky to be alive and have grown closer to the people i care about since my injury so I see each day as a gift Yeah your friend is being stupid My spinal cord injury isn t particularly sever but as a result of it I now know dozens of people with higher level injuries who are full time wheelchair users They do indeed live happy fulfilling lives   I know several Paralympic athletes a man who got his pilot s license after his injury many people who are happily married  some met their partners after their injuries  a woman who took up painting with a paintbrush in her mouth after her injury and now makes thousands for every painting she sells and can t keep up with demand and also many people who are happy with their everyday lives in smaller ways too   Adjusting to life with a spinal cord injury is hard and I would never want to downplay how difficult that can be both physically and mentally But living with a spinal cord injury is just like anything else and a fulfilling life is certain possible   and I d even say fairly common  I am about the same as far as happiness and fulfillment as I was before my injury I too am grateful to be alive broke my neck at 18 Life is still good  I m a T10 complete from an injury in April 2018 I ve got a pretty good life A lot of amazing things have happened I never open a door in public anymore Apparently the whole world is my staff that hold doors open whenever I come and go   I suffered a brain injury at the same time as the spinal cord injury The tbi is much better now I ll take the spinal cord injury over the tbi any day It s one thing when your legs won t listen to you  it s a whole other thing when your brain isn t listening  I m very happy thank you for asking I ve a great family good friends and a strong support network I work full time I also volunteer for RNLI  pre and post injury I just don t go to sea anymore  I play sports and have an active social life Yes life is more difficult in a chair but that is not because I m disabled it because I live in world which is not designed for wheelchair users I live a very fulfilling life and to be quite honest with you I wouldn t change anything even the SCI well maybe the chronic pain bit but I ve learnt to disassociate from that so it doesn t bother me so much What I ve been through in the last 12 years while tough and daunting at times has made me the person I am today and I m very grateful for that  I have days where I hate it I wish it weren t so I cry for about 10 minutes then I move on  It s not every day mind you But people without SCI have days like that too  Everyone has  something    On average I d say I m actually pretty happy I ve certainly had to make adjustments and given the chance I d like a cure But until then I m good  There are psychologists psychiatrists that specialize in  rehab medicine   What makes some people resilient to change and how to give that gift to those who are suffering They would understand and have statistics on the quality of life in general after a spinal cord injury or any other major catastrophic life changing injury like an amputation   Personally I feel like I ve been hanging on by a thread for years Every year has been worse than the last with the exception of last year which may be the reason why I m still here Playing things day to day    I disagree  And you re absolutely right  Generally I m pretty good   just sort of get on with things to more or less the same level as I did previous to my SCI Not saying there isn t issues but there are issues with literally everything and if I focused purely on them I d have a rough time of it regardless of physical ability   deleted  Thank you for taking the time to write that out Chronic pain would be my biggest fear if I suffered some type of traumatic injury My sister had to amputate part of her leg and now suffer from phantom pain that comes and goes It really can t imagine what it would be like to live with that and it sucks that she might have to live with it the rest of her life Makes me sad that I can t do anything about it but I hope the rest of her time not spend being in pain is good enough to make up for it This was a beautiful comment thank you for sharing I am have an SCI   t 6  about a year and a half in I would say I am extremely happy in life and am very fulfilled and would agree 100  that it s all about the environment you surround yourself with and the perspective you stay attached too I was depressed initially after my injury of course as adjusting was extremely difficult and it was very easy to get stuck living in the past Since then I have taken a  live life one day at a time  philosophy and I think that has helped me significantly as well I do plan on reading about this disability paradox it sounds interesting I wasn t planning on typing all of this but just wanted to conclude thanks I appreciate this comment  If feel like your friend has a little lack of imagination which in my opinion is probably more of a disability than mine   Gave me a good chuckle haha He s not a bad guy but sometimes he s got some stupid opinions   From what I know humans are very good at adapting to new situations and changes I figured it would be the same with a disability Probably very shitty at first but once you get used to it just another part of life   Would you say that most of the problems that have resulted in your life after your injury  or if you were born with it  is caused by other people rather than the disability itself By that I mean people judging you for your disability or lack of proper accommodations like ramps etc Yeah figured he was being stupid Most of my own hobbiest are done without my legs so I think that if I ended up in a wheelchair I could still like a content life I think he s just projecting his own feelings of what he would do with that kind of disability onto everyone else I ve been on bed rest for three months and now in hospital I need three more surgeries which will put me on bedrest for another two months estimated Lying here in pain Yet oddly embracing that pain as warmth and having a lovely day enjoying myself listening to music But I feel really happy and looking forward to the future  lots to look forward to because I still make a huge effort to work hard stay in touch with people and keep progressing with life I can t move or feel from the chest down  it s all about perspective and keeping busy and being constructive and growing Thank you for answering I m hoping I ll be able to convince my friend that he s wrong that a person a SCI can t live a fulfilling life  Everyone has  something    Very true I don t have any kind of physical disability and I still need some time to cry on occasion too I m sure there s lots of people out there with some debilitating disabilities who live a happier life than people without them I hope things continue to go well for you Succinct I like it Sorry to hear that I hope keep fighting and that you find something that you really love doing that makes the pain worth it How would you describe how nerve pain feels There are two types for me internal and external  My internal nerve pain feels more dull like a pliers is gripping an internal muscle or bone and trying to twist  My external nerve pain is a hypersensitivity  Patches of skin fluctuate between total numbness and hypersensitivity where a light brush against the skin can feel anywhere from stabbing with a thousand really skinny needles or that period of time after dumping boiling water on your skin after the initial shock has worn off  Like being burnt by fire or the worst frost bite imaginable Just an intense burning feeling sometimes hot sometimes cold  My partner only has nerve pain in his pelvic area He says it feels like he has a bladder infection  even though he doesn t  It sounds annoying since he thinks he has one sometimes yet it comes up as completely negative There s a burning sensation in his penis sometimes pins and needles around his butt It sounds very uncomfortable   Get a Sunburn caused by electric arcing then go lay out in the sun next to one of those big decorative grass plants that has the long sword like leaves that bend over and point towards the ground Let the tips of those swords poke you randomly in the breeze   Also the breeze hurts  My specific pain is like multiple or 1 really thick needle is pulsating and stabbing me Like an electrical shock that umis drawn out Or sometimes it feels like someone is taking a razor and dragging it across mt muscles and tendons   L1 Incomplete Ten Months Since Injury Walking Poorly With a Cane   Right now it feels like a snake has latched onto my right leg and has its teeth deep into my ankle Often it feels like a mix between my leg being held in a fire and someone actively trying to rip it off There is such a wide range of stabbing and burning and pins and needles and aching   I also have almost no sensation or function in that area of my leg Just this intense crippling pain It often has me crying out and wondering if I m actively dying All of my body tenses up I catch myself not breathing My teeth clench My face gets all tense and unnatural looking If I m in public I might just be breathing heavy and staring at the floor hoping that it passes Someone listening closely might hear the occasional whimper and someone watching me will see my body tense and release drastically and often I feel non functional I can usually listen while in pain but often I can t watch something or speak I ve gotten better at talking through it but it s very tough to concentrate on what I m saying At home it typically has me laying in bed writhing as the pain shoots through my leg and I try everything I can to distract myself which is often reddit which requires very little attention span but is distracting enough to pull me away from the pain mentally At home I ll cry out fairly often and luckily the neighbors haven t complained yet   Almost nothing helps Sleep can sometimes be a brief reprieve but the pain will wake me up Pain meds might offer a bit of relief but the pain pushes through I have high hopes for a spinal cord stimulator trial that should be happening in the next couple months I ve tried various meds heat cold massage being barefoot topical creams tens machines desensitization therapy and so many more things The pain endures often even more angry that I tried to get rid of it   One thing I did find helpful is reading through these comments and the reminder that I m not alone and my case is not unique Thank you everyone for sharing your stories You re all so strong and we can all get through this Don t give up I m confident within the next few years there will be more options on the market to help us Let s push on in hopes it ll get better Take care all  I miss hugs    It depends on the day Sometimes its an annoying almost vibration like tingling and burning One a bad day it feels very similar to a bad sunburn  That varies quite a lot It ranges from mild itching via a dull ache to severe un ignorable repeating stabs of pain The latter is worsened by the fact it has an impending aura I can feel it coming and there s nothing I can do about it at that point but tense up Luckily and as annoying as the occasional attack is now it s as nothing compared to the agony caused by what turned out to be a large tumor compressing my spinal cord from the inside  The best way I describe it to people who don t know what it s like  It s like if you have ever had your foot fall asleep so bad it hurts   And mine goes from my ass to my toes lol  Like I ve been stabbed with the hottest ice pick you could imagine Then to make it worse the tip explodes like a firework and that feels just as hot and sharp Sometimes it only lasts a few seconds and others it pulsates for a few minutes to a few hours The longest I ve had it last was about 24 hours After my last surgery I had it just above the bend of my right knee on the backside of my leg After complaining enough a nurse helped me turn and found a small piece of tape stuck to my leg and as soon as she pulled it off it eased up for a few minutes until we found another piece of tape stuck to the same leg a little higher up That was about half way through and I didn t get any sleep until the second night It s been almost 3 months and I still have issues with that same spot Just randomly it ll go off  I get it in my feet and it feels like your being devoured by piranha Also get pain in my right shin that feels like a green branch being bent and it s as if I feel all the fibres under tension  Like sitting on a bed of needles for a long while or like wearing acupuncture sandals  except the sandal is made of wood or some hard metal  Around the pelvic region imagine a knitting needle pressing against your muscles for 30 seconds to 2 minutes nonstop heating up the surrounding area numbing sensation around calf muscles with that overworked muscular movement it generates when those muscles go tired And against the thighs as though a bed of filed nails is being pressed in a massage like movement Summing up a weird pull effect in the toes Or a small electric shock equal to touching 2 9 volt battery on your tongue either in your toes or around pelvic region  It s like the angriest white hot ball of hatred Like a tiny star is being formed inside of you It s the purest essence of pain that no medicine or therapy can touch  Feels like that point when your arm is asleep cause you were laying on it weird and it starts tingling like crazy and you get real mad at it to stop tingling but it never stops Except down your entire body lol Mines comes as an itch somewhere on my arm thats spreads up or down the arm and gets more itchy scratching it has no effect   _  Feels like burning and pulsating down the leg for me I ve got injury to L5s1 up to L2l3 and sometimes it feels like if you wear really tight socks and take them off but it still feels uncomfortable  Painful pins of staticky fiery ice needles Like my right foot is constantly burning Nerve pain feels like a toothache Times 1 000 You can t take anything to get rid of the pain and it doesn t subside  Mine is like m4dch3mist s in that the muscle contracts intensely and I also get the hypersensitivity but I ll also on occasion get a burning sensation The hyper part is usually when something is wrong with my system like UTI or something The others can either be singular or come on together Fun huh  Hope it helps  Combine rope burn mixed with hitting your funny bone and throw in some banging your knee with a dash of being punched in the gut for that extra bit of nerve pain spice And this is just from wearing a bra or a tank with minimal support  When I was a kid I fell on a electric cattle fence my nerve pain feels exactly like that  I think my brain uses that incident as a reference  I describe internal nerve pain as similar to pins and needles but far more extreme that for me basically never goes away   The reason being that everyone will have experienced pins and needles at some point and so it helps them to understand from their own experience what the pain is like   My external nerve pain is hypersensitivity across my neck shoulders and back So on a really bad day it feels like my shirt collar is slicing my throat open  I get ripping sensations and then numbness The Dr s keep saying there s no damage but it really stings after Especially in my eyes Using the clutch in my car makes me end up limping for days They say everyone describes the same thing and there is no damage Anyone else get ripping in their connective tissue  If you took TV static electified it and ran it through your nerves Or like if you take your foot falling asleep and then run that signal through an amplifier for like a basketball stadium    My external nerve pain is a hypersensitivity  Dude me too some of the hypersensitive areas in my toe I can feel tingle all the way up to my glute when touched  It s crazy This absolutely and wind blowing on my skin is uncomfortable AF Identical for me   it feels like razor blades in my intestines Ditto   except gradienting down from chest I also get electric stabbing headaches which feel like someone got a knitting needle electrified it and then jammed it under my skin That s a solid description Random numbnessBroken C4   Upcoming ACDF SurgeryHello I fractured and subluxed C4 and C5 and had them fused from the front with a plate This was early March and I went from full paralysis before surgery to wiggling my toe afterwards Walking took another  2 6 weeks and I am now mountain biking wakeboarding and preparing for ski season though not at my previous level Doc says my vertebrae are just as strong as before You will have a far quicker and easier recovery given the lack of spinal cord damage My folks said the surgery was pretty quick Feel free to DM me with any more questions I fractured C2 3 and 4 in April of 2016 I couldn t move anything from the shoulders down The did a posterior cervical fusion the day of the accident I m able to walk with 2 canes have sensation all over  although that s not always a good thing I m also a registered nurse I have an extensive background in trauma critical care and care management including revenue cycle I am fortunate to be able to work and manage RN Care Managers and Social Workers The hospital I work at is an orthopedic center if excellence Most people that have ACDF are outpatient and go home the same day Since you had a trauma that caused it the surgeon may keep you overnight or 2 nights max You got this I hope it alleviates your symptoms  Just wondering how do your strength levels feel That s amazing that you are back to doing the activities that you enjoy but do you feel weaker in anyway Assuming you just have modified your styles to match your body now  if even needed  Your words mean a lot coming from someone who had a worse injury than me and your career Did you work in this same field before your accident   I am not sure if this is considered an ignorant question or not so forgive me if so but do you think over time the walking will come easier to where you will not need both canes   I hope the days you feel pain get farther and farther between each other Quadriplegic talking about bladder management in latest YouTube vid lol watched the first 30 seconds of the video  was reading my other screen and that  URINE luck  joke caught me off guard and gave me a good laugh Hey just watched the video I found this incredibly informative and gave me a better perspective of the day to day routine when living with an SCI Thanks for sharing  Visiting the Grand CanyonGreat trail for rolling along on the south rim Plenty of lodging but avoid the high tourist season  summer  everything stays booked solid Call ahead to hotels and speak to front desk and get a name Don t ever confirm access or equipment with corporate booking if it is a chain  Having your own vehicle allows you to avoid the buses They have turnouts all along the south rim where you can park and access the long trail Some spots have better views than others  Watch the weather if going in Spring or Fall you would be surprised the altitude on the rim We went for Spring Break and it snowed briefly but it was awesome Now would be a good time to go but not sure if and when the park closes for winter I think the North Rim does close  I see you are a newbie Make sure the hotel set up is adequate for your injury level If a para most can be managed But be mindful of shower chair Some have no backs and are more designed for old folks I travel a lot  T 6 para  and often just sit in the bottom of the tub shower Roll ins can be a pain if no fold down and no other seating available Sometimes I ask to speak with Head of maintenance or housekeeping to understand shower chair set up Beware old hotels with  accessible  rooms Often door widths are a no go Also some old hotels have funky steps in the rooms Ask about that also Toilets are ok for me at T 6 assuming I can actually get to it LOL  Just like everything we face it s a learning curve First few times are scary but then it becomes old hat But be aware accessible travel is fluid with no hard norms or rules Everybody doing just enough to get by with ADA or trying to please all levels of need when we all have different needs Don t let the frustrations ruin the trip but don t be intimidated by the staff either Most want to do right I ve had them take bathroom door off the hinges more times that I can count I ve had them go borrow a chair from another hotel Be polite but firm and insistent Have fun traveling I ve been over half the world in a chair Don t stay home  Hi just in case you didn t know you can a free national park pass  It is a disability perk https   store usgs gov access pass The South Rim has at least one long accessible paved trail with breathtaking views The shuttles between sites are accessible and they bump you to the front of every line and make sure that you re seated first You ll also be allowed to drive your car to certain loops  I m sure mileage varies depending on your mobility but for me the Grand Canyon was pretty good accessibility wise They have a bunch of information on their website and there s a guide available  here  https   www nps gov grca planyourvisit upload GRCA Accessibility Guide 2018 pdf  As a manual wheelchair user the accessible trails are pretty easy and there are plenty of accessible viewpoints with good views from a wheelchair   When you arrive  I was driving  if you make sure to tell the staff that you re a wheelchair user and you require access they should give you an accessible guide For me when asking about whether I could get on and off a shuttle bus if you re not sure they might be able to give you a pass to drive yourself to the various viewpoints  a lot are shut off to vehicles so you can walk or take the bus    Re hotels I m sure there s plenty of choice  and again sure it depends on your exact needs  but I stayed at the  Best Western Premier Grand Canyon Squire Inn  https   www tripadvisor co uk Hotel_Review g31393 d226761 Reviews Best_Western_Premier_Grand_Canyon_Squire_Inn Tusayan_Arizona html  which from what I remember was fine for my needs  This was so helpful    thank you Sweet Thanks    do you know how long it takes to receive the pass after applying for it When I went to Yosemite National Park I just showed them my disabled placard and the paperwork that came with it then they handed me a golden pass card  That was it Every year my wife and I would buy the annual park pass Now I never have to buy another one and it only cost about  1 2M in hospital costs and five months of my life It s pricey but worth it    Haha please note the heavy sarcasm Did you have to bring your own shower equipment Leg bag smell What bag are you using now Which one did you use before  I really like the bags I use but they do start to smell quickly sometimes  Right now they are starting to smell after 2 days already  but my piss has been smelling pretty bad recently in the first place   Normally they go for about 5 days   I m using Holister  mine are free from insurance so I don t really care that I use up so many lol   https   www scisupply ca products hollister leg bag Sorry to hear that your previous leg bags aren t available Wondering if you re able to feel your bladder and if you ve used catheter valves or plugs before  Hi I m pretty new to this community    I m an undergrad student and am interested in learning more about SCI If you don t mind my asking how bad do your bags usually smell after 2 5 days Is it noticeable to people around you     x200B   Also I d be interested to know if you ve been able to use catheter valves or plugs before Broke T12 What does this RAD report mean It means you broke your back but you do not have a spinal cord injury  A burst fracture is a traumatic fracture where the vertebra literally looks like it exploded It s a type of compression fracture It sends bone pieces into tissue when it fractures That is what the retropulsion means It means the fracture caused bits of fractured pieces to move back into your spinal canal where your spinal cord is but you only have narrowing to the canal itself not actual damage to the spinal cord With compression fractures you lose height in your vertebrae so your doctor was saying you had lost some height in your vertebra because it was compressed and then broken by whatever you hit   You got very lucky  It means you re in the wrong sub    It means you broke your back but you do not have a spinal cord injury   Figuratively dodged a bullet there Thank you  It s been two weeks and still a lot of pain and my feet feel like balloons for lack of a better way to describe it and pain in my legs Assuming it s nerve damage    Chronic Pain and the Will to LiveYou put words to how I feel every day Thank you    I don t see any way out of this    that doesn t mean that there isn t a way I was a long distance walker and a trail hiker I can now not get around the block without paying for it for a few days However I have over the last few years have slowly starting to accept my limitations more and plan around them  There is still pain and no  doubt it sucks bad but it does not trump my life Get a support group   for me it was this sub reddit  Please before you do something drastic please think of what I said Its your life but remember your life effects everyone that loves you as well  Dude I feel you  I ve been dealing with my pain for twenty years and it s so frustrating  I d love to work out so much more than I m able to  It sucks having to dole out your time so sparingly    spoon theory   https   en wikipedia org wiki Spoon_theory  the kids call it these days   It REALLY sucks when I m dating and the men are like  Let s go for coffee then maybe lunch and after we can go to the park   Then I have to explain why I can t do all that   I ve found various things to do in bed  Right now I m learning how to make music using a free program called LMMS you can download here  https   sourceforge net projects lmms  It s really fun  Another is Zooniverse https   www zooniverse org   a site where you can participate in crowdsourced research projects  I ve scanned satellite images to

19th century  At Coursera https   www coursera org courses query free you can search for things you might be interested in learning more about   Don t get the wrong impression  I m not someone who keeps myself busy everyday with these things  I have many days where my pain gets me down and I have a hard time focusing I get depressed and cynical and I don t want to do anything  But I have noticed that when I do have the energy and I do things online where I m  active  instead of passively consuming I feel marginally better  So I try to mix that in with the movies and shows and such  Hope that helps  I feel ya bro Have you tried MMJ I couldnt get through the daily pain and have a  normal  life without it  I m sorry you re hurting physically and emotionally Please don t apologize for how you feel your feelings are valid and completely understandable Social media leads us to believe that everyone is happy all the time and life is rainbows and unicorns The really valuable posts are the ones that allow us to see that this isn t true that everyone has bad days or weeks Everyone deals with pain differently and mourning the things you used to be able to do is normal So share away this is a good place to do it Hugs and comfort to you  I understand all too well how you re feeling Hopefully it ll get better for you  Reading this right this moment as I type I realize you have just spoken out my emotions w r t pain not wanting to do nothing but the bundle of pain it comes with you have spoken my mind out This morning I had fallen off my wheelchair and it took a lot of fight to climb back up by myself And ever since then the deep pain in my butt bone  lack of awareness of a better word to it  has been bothering me Do much so that when I am not doing routine it obstructs creativity I do probably think swelling up of my feet and the pain is probably correlated but can t be for sure My feet are swollen up crazy and by morning subside a lot But the cyclic chain hasn t broken  You should explore that too   This is not the first time but at the same time I have not lost the will to live for I believe I have to see a lot more in life And I have kept myself surrounded by amazing friends whom I can call anytime and nephew who looks upto me And I believe in being around people who inspire and encourage and watch some meditation videos or some self realization videos This makes me aware about myself   I think you should too if you haven t already  Look into acupuncture It s how I got off norco and was able to start functioning again I m t3 t4 Also any hamstring stretches you do could help lower back some  I don t have much to say other than that you re a truly courageous person and are enduring something that would have already broken me and 99 9  of the people walking this earth I hope that something changes for you soon  Have you tried swimming I m assuming your arms and top half of body is ok I swim with a floaty under my legs to lift them up   It s the only exercise I can really do that makes me puff now I also think it helps my back too  I relate so much with what you re saying I also can t sit for very long at all I also have to lay down constantly and I can t stay asleep for too long before being awoken by pain   This is just a stranger s advice on the internet but you need to accept that you re not as capable as everyone else and that you need to care for yourself prior to caring for others otherwise you ll just screw it up both ways   It s a terribly hard juggling act and I know it s got to be crazy stressful but I ve found in my life that I get periods now of peace and relaxation They are way more rare than b4 my surgery but they do happen   I m trying to make those moments happen more often and last but it doesn t seem to work Life is too demanding for me I share a lot of your depressive  what am I supposed to do now   thoughts   Keep your head up tho plz as things have changed a lot over the years with my pain It s almost like you can build up a stable system but it won t work within reality s system Imo I got a lot better after I agreed with myself that I can t fully relate to people who don t have chronic pain They either get it or they don t and I have to be ok with that   You ever need someone to talk to DM me I could really use someone to relate with when it comes to not being able to sit for any real amount of time at all It screws up all of life imo and in so many ways It s very hard to navigate I relate    Peace Have you tried a tens unit while sitting up That may be beneficial Do you mind elaborating more on the pain Can you sit up on a sofa without pain or is it sitting up anywhere Is the area that you experience pain a weak area I used to have a low sitting tolerance due to severe nerve pain It has improved over time I also got a much better chair that helped with it Not all situations are the same so I understand from that aspect Your injury is still fairly new so different things will change over time Hopefully your pain will be something that improves  What is your injury and when were you injured  Can you give an example of how you plan around a limitation for an activity   I m not going to do anything drastic life is short after all and it will all be over soon enough anyway Love the people that love me too much to do anything like that However not wanting to do anything with any of them and constantly being in pain and a bad mood probably isn t cake walk for them to see either Would be nice to just disappear and be forgotten Thank you so much for this Thank you for sharing and I m sorry you are familiar with the struggle I have people around me trying to inspire and encourage me but it all comes right back to pain Seems like there s no  other side  to push through to it is what it is now No doubt I could be better about my thoughts and meditation can help every situation should probably get back into it I also get a very deep tissue massage every week for the muscles that are super tight First time I swam I felt like Lieutenant Dan from Forrest Gump as he was back stroking into the sunset Amazing taking all of the pressure off of everything Unfortunately I don t have access to a place to swim regularly Working on getting a hottub right now hoping that is a game changer I have tried a tens unit and it didn t do anything for me The pain is more related to the angle I m sitting at rather than how soft it is Hurts sitting up straight even if I were on a cloud Broken femur shattered pelvis burst fractured L4 along with multiple fractures in the S T C regions 12 8 19 Seen all sorts of improvements in the past months Sitting pain hasn t budged Do you walk in your dreams I do yeah I figure it s because I know how to walk in my head it s my body that doesn t behave  If I do walk in my dreams I always have the sudden realisation that I can t and then fall over  It s been 15 years  T12  and I m still AB in my dreams  Occasionally I ll have my chair with me but I can always just hop out of it when I want to  I was middle aged when I got hurt though so I ve only been in a chair for 1 4 of my life  My brain was well used to walking for decades  Might be different the younger someone has their SCI  I m 31 years post injury and I m rarely disabled in my dreams I dream about me walking a lot but I m always with my chair usually pushing it in front of me I ve never didn t have my chair when I dreamt I was walking No but I m ambulatory although it s not pretty  T8 incomplete 40 years   I have dreams of peeing normally and not being able to run  which I can t  when I need to Best wishes Every dream since it happened I walk  Sometimes I m in my chair but when I come across an obstacle or need to be somewhere I just get up and walk away  Needless to say I m often disappointed come morning  I am constantly doing the splits in my dreams Never done a split in my life but post injury Allll the splits dreams I m 14 years in C6 complete I have never had a dream of being in my chair Yet when I walk in my dreams it s as if I m on a flat escalator my legs are moving and doing the motion but my body is gliding Maybe that s my brains way of keeping it somewhat real  Before I was comfortable with myself my injury I ALWAYS walked in my dreams  I haven t walked in my dreams ever since I made peace with the injury   The bizarre part about that is that I never was able to walk IRL because my injury happened at 6 months old   I did a video for my channel a while back on this very subject   https   www youtube com watch v lcJ4h3M8Wt8 I had an incomplete injury and definitely did before I recovered  13 years into injury still and only walk in dreams and its really nice to do all the things you can t in reality during those dreams  walking up is literally into painful reality  It s been 10 years for me and I rarely have dreams I m in my wheelchair and halfway through I ll realize I can still move and walk Sometimes I dream about horseback riding All the time yes but I m always aware that my walking is not quite right  My brother had his injury about 10 years ago and he s C5 complete wheelchair bound ever since Every dream he s in of mine he has more function than in real life Usually in my dreams he can walk in short spurts then we help him when he gets tired Sometimes he doesn t get tired and just walks the whole way to wherever   Thanks for this post I ve often wondered this myself  All the time but then again sometimes im in my chair too  Ive been injured 1 5 years  I have a lot of dreams where I m standing up and levitating around not walking or pushing a wheelchair When I was first paralyzed I had a lot of dreams sitting in my wheelchair at the top of steep long staircases  Same it s the weirdest thing I get slowly weaker throughout my dream as I start to  remember  lol same I regularly get dreams where i ve lost my chair and I walk all around the place trying to find it like my subconcious recognizes that it s important but hasn t quite sorted out whyBiofeedback While I ve heard the term I don t know anything about it  Are you referring to this  https   www health

oi scholart  It looks like there have been studies focused on varying specific issues that affect people with nerve damage disorders like SCI patients as well as wheelchair users in general to varying degrees of success   It sounds like something that might be worth at least talking to a doctor about and I d be interested in hearing anyone s personal experience with it  Trying to support my cousin with a C7 injuryThe best thing anyone did for me at such an early stage was turn up  c6 7 June last year   now COVID 19 may make that hard but Skype would be a close second There s not much you can actually do apart from be there to talk and listen  Later when things are more settled and the long parth to recovery is a bit clearer then it more useful to get your hands dirty so to speak with helping with PT and alike  But for now just be there even if that means sitting in their room and not talking   Everyone s outcome is different I was told I might be able to walk short distance  m ft  last week i walked to the shops wandered around abit got some lunch and walked home all with my walking polls  all up about 1 6km or 1mil so still short just not as short as it was predicted   Your cousins out come will be different but it s really hard to predict what it s going to be at this stage in my experience  Paaaaatience You re gonna have to be so patient One of the things that drove me mad in therapy was  move this   move that   come on try  and I m like Bitch I AM TRYING  Nothing is worse than telling your toes to move and they just don t do it  or any part  He s gonna have a lot on his mind and the last thing he needs is to feel like he s being judged Good luck brotha  Find out what the resources are in his home community and have that information on hand  Discharge planning is supposed to do it I was at a top five rehab they did nothing   I went on to subacute and then home with literally no information at all  Do some research on funding sources for things he enjoyed   gaming sports   bc adaptive equipment is expensive and resources are finite  Know that his wants and needs are going to be really fluid for the first year or so and don t take it personally  How long did it take for a body part to wake up after a spinal cord injury Well never if its a complete injury And all incomplete injuries are different Personally I was a talking head for 3 months and got various things back over the next year Getting stronger in year 2 and then plateauing from there Saying that 20  years later my right thumb started  wotking  again As in I can wiggle it some and grip a bit still waiting lol 2 months I went from no sensation below my waist and then in a period of 2 days had full control back just lack of sensation in certain areas  It happened 2 years ago but still have constant nerve pain  Wow 20 years later and function returned That sounds really inspirationalAny idea how many motor nerve roots or myotomes you regained function of This is a semi redo of an old video I did back in 2011 I did add something new though I wasn t even aware of my  drop foot  until one of my viewers mentioned it to me As for the knee flexibility I absolutely believe that I ve gained a little more range of motion since the previous video Question for quads about widows This question is less morbid than I thought it was going to be  Went from sad to boring in 3 seconds  My dad has found it easy to open the sliding glass door by grabbing the handle and moving forward in his chair Maybe windows that slide side to side rather than opening up and down or cranking  I would think crank windows would be easiest  I just saw my mistake haha   Will look into that tyNew L1 Complete Family MemberJust a note  The emotional recovery time for SCI can be very long    sometimes years  While optimism and positivity are certainly important be sure to allow him to experience the full range of emotions that can come including anger sadness fear and grief  That last one is particularly important because with so many changes it can feel like you ve lost so much  not only what his life is like now but also things he may have wanted in his future  Your entire life path can get rerouted and it can be shocking  He may need to experience periods of grief in order to get through this and sometimes it s hard for families to let this happen  They can misinterpret it as  giving up  when really it s simply a natural part of the grieving process  Families may also find it difficult because they themselves are trying to get through it and if everyone keeps a smile on their face it s like they don t have to deal with feeling the pain of what happened or the fear and anxiety of the uncertainty of his recovery   If you and your family insist on pushing a relentlessly optimistic attitude on him he may start hiding or repressing his darker feelings and this will only delay his emotional healing  So my advice would be to let him feel what he feels no matter what that is and support him regardless  For books   I think the social and mental understanding is really important   Rebecca Taussig Sitting Pretty Alice Wong  Disability Visibility  For rehab info

through this are happy to help others by sharing their insight and eventually you may be helping someone else down the line  This is really important for us to hear It is all very fresh and scary for

to get my hands on it Thank you Dealing with inconsistent bowels  Our brains  and bowels  must be in sink Bahaha Mentally I too can handle most of this new screwy life but bowel problems is not one of them It puts me in a funk so quick Watching my diet is okay but when there s an issue I m right back to diagnosing what went wrong I guess I m luckier than most cause my wife is a champ in these situations Good luck to you and I hope you find something that brings you back to a positive time before you were injured  Seems like you have an incomplete injury What s your usual bowel routine Do you use any laxatives or suppositories Do you use dig stim  I m trying to get out of my funk but it s hard I can go for weeks but then something happens that will bring me crashing back down Hubby wants me to do therapy with someone who specializes in disability and illness but I never felt comfortable talking to professionals Usually it s just when I gotta go Sometimes it takes forever and I can t squeeze so I have to use an enemeez Since I can t feel a drop in my tummy I have to rely on other faint sensations like a general feeling of fullness that needs to come out I know routine is fine for some but I don t want to use a suppository constantly cuz I don t want to become dependent on it I want to stop leaking and wearing diapers  22F SCI Make sure you don t have an underlying urinary infection That can cause leaks Else swap to pads instead of a diaper try oxybutin If that doesn t help ask about botox in the bladder   What level are you  Talk to your urologist   Oxybutynin can work but you may need to take multiple throughout the day Oxybutynin always has heavy side effects for me and also has been shown to affect cognitive function long term so I recommend against it   The best option is to get Botox in your bladder It s a very quick and routine procedure that holds for up to 6 months It s covered under insurance too   Find a urologist that specializes in neurogenic bladder Or any urologist really  Botox works for me I was introduced to mybetriq during inpatient rehab and it did wonders for me on top of oxybutynin I was initially only using oxybutynin and was constantly leaking After being introduced to myrbetriq the leakages stopped C5 quad here I take 2x  day oxybutinine 1x every 2 days betmiga and 2x  year botox and this works like a charm i use toviaz and mybetriq i never had any leaking but i would be peeing 10x a day without it A similar drug to Oxybutynin  is Trospium   seems to work better for me   less dry mouth Urologists don t typically prescribe cause it s more expensive  My urethra was worn away from having a foley long term so the Botox shots and pxybutinin did nothing so I got a bladder sling  It s been amazing Def a bit more of an invasive surgery but it lasts at least 10 years and I o lr leak if I get really full It s also helped me retain my volume  They basically take some tissue cartilage from the leg then go inthe rough the vagina and create a  strap  to support and close the urethra  Best decision ever  It solved my bladder infections Suprapubic is the bomb I would never have had ad the confidence to date again without it   Now about that lack of erections   I heard from another quad that pumpkin seeds help him reduce leaking Surely it s not as effective as the hardcore medical options in here but it can t hurt to snack on some pumpkin seeds from time to time  I take a daily low dose antibiotic and went like 3 years without a UTI Before that it was like every 4 months  That s when I have problems I m a t5 complete but can tell when I have to cath with like 2 minutes before I leak  but I m a guy  You ladies always have it rougher it seems no matter what it is  T6 I m on it I spoke to my urologist about the cognitive effects and she reassured me very clearly that it s not a risk for young people without other factors for dementia Those studies showed it worsening existing dementia symptoms while using it not creating a long term risk   What about poise pads instead of diapers Oxybutinine helps but doesn t prevent leaks entirely  Def talk to a urologist WHat heavy side effects do you have   I take oxybutine for 4 years now and 3 times a day   What long term effect do occur   I m curious now my urologist didn t tell me anything about this Fellow botox user here it s awesome Though I didn t leak it was done for pressure and UTI reduction Uncomfortable incident while flying  pee related Can always try an adult diaper for longer flights   I got food poisoning and a really bad case of the runs on a 6 hour flight  all started during boarding  With 1 glove and no lube I spent almost four hours in the toilet I can comfortably say that after that experience nothing much can phase me Take it in stride You flew cross country during a pandemic for a job interview That s major props  Lol it s better than the other type of waste I had a little accident one time while flying and felt really bad for the guy sitting next to me who had to catch that whiff every time I shifted my weight   I might look into absorbent pads for incontinence I use them every day and they make a huge difference Also limiting your liquid intake before hand to dehydrate yourself might help but it s a little bit of a dangerous game to play  If a flight is 2 hours or more I try to make certain that I have a seat as close to the restroom as possible so that I can forego the aisle chair completely   Here s what it goes like typically   https   youtu be bbfWIZm P1c  I have seen wheelchair accessible bathrooms on planes but they are super rare in my experience   There really isn t an easy way to do the bathroom thing on a plane unfortunately    I hadn t thought at all about the attendants helping with the aisle chair in such close proximity during the pandemic but that is a great point  Scary times      I m a guy but in that situation I ll either try and evacuate my bowels as much as possible the night before and if I m still feeling unsure I ll take an immodium before the flight For pee I use a a condom catheter connected to a bag strapped to my leg You can find that That s what I hear truckers do too  I agree As a C2 flying is horrible for people on wheelchair particularly quadriplegics and paraplegics You can also try different diapers because I have found that significantly impacts the comfort you have during the flight   Also I always use a suppository at least 12 hours before the flight to minimize an even worse situation It helps a lot  Do you normally self cath For a flight that long I ll stick in an indwelling cath with a leg bag Not ideal but better than nothing  This is the way  Even with Botox and going right before  it isn t worth the stress That looks like a brave way to get to the bathroom but I m not sure I would want to be on the floor rn and I don t think I have the ab  chest strength to do that Still a viable option in an emergency though I wish there was a good way to use plane bathrooms Especially on long flights As a girl unfortunately I don t really have that option for cathing But it s definitely a useful tool for those who can use it Yeah I do intermittent cathing and went to the bathroom right before the flight I haven t used an indwelling cath out of the hospital T9 T12Complete finding advice on shower and toiletingHi there I m 29yo T8 T9 complete SCI I m totally new to this as I ve just been home for  4months since hospital discharge   For number 1 I was previously doing intermittent cath in rehab hospital But I found it way too troublesome to keep transferring plus I kept leaking so I switched to indwelling cath So much easier to just empty my urine bag   For number 2 I ll go every other day and before my shower I can only go with the help of laxatives so I ll make sure the timing is right Lax takes 9 12h to work for me and I only shower at night So usually I ll take lax at 10am when I first wake up   transfer from my wheelchair to commode at around 830pm   head to bathroom   transfer from commode to toilet bowl   start digital stimulation   clean up   transfer back from toilet bowl to commode   shower This whole process takes  45m now as compared to 1 5 2h during my first month at home   I m also wearing diapers to prevent accidents There were a few instances where my number 2 came a few hours earlier than expected   came a second time after shower   came on the days where I did not take my lax Really to be safe than sorry I can t imagine having to clean the mess up on my bed or on my wheelchair cushion My diaper is usually quite clean so to be more economical I change it every other day too   Anyways I just wanna say it ll take time to find what works best for you You ll just have to adapt and adjust from your hospital routine to your home environment I hope my comment will help you in some way All the best  Your experience helps a lot  Thank you so much  Any video game or entertainment

development Santorini   this game feels like checkers and connect four had a baby with zeus Lots of fun variations as you move your pieces around the board and knock your opponents down   Splendor   use tokens to buy favor with masters and nobles  yes this game has cards but you don t have to hold them in your hands   Quirkle   scrabble with sets of shapes The blocks are large and easy to handle   Carcassonne   this game feels similar to Settlers of Catan but instead of playing your pieces on an existing landscape to gather resources you re building the landscape Block off your opponents and build roads and cities to conquer the most land  Rummikub My husband was introduced to that game when he was in rehab for sci It s a tile game that very easy to learn and also great for the mind  This is not a board game but hear me out  Kinetic sand  It is like a small sandbox for the hands and the sand can be molded sculpted you can also hide things in it  I regained a lot of dexterity using it It s very portable easily stored in a ziplock and pretty inexpensive   I second rummikub and qwirkle  We also played dominos and something called blokus which I don t even know how to explain desktop bowling  yeah really  and made elaborate contraptions out of pop beads  Also talk to the therapeutic recreation people   they might have birdhouses to assemble or paint or mini basketball or something he might really enjoy  When OT and TRec get together it is really something  If he can t hold cards but you wanna play card games cut a pool noodle into a  6 inch section Then cut a slit lengthwise You can then insert the cards upright into the slit and hold the pool noodle to see your hand Much easier to hold with a weak grip They also make adaptive card holders but pool noodles are more fun and less money Maybe puzzles Not the 1 000 piece ones with the tiny pieces but something with larger easier to grab pieces crokinole  Trouble mancala bananagrams scrabble risk and battleship could all be good depending on how much control he has over his pinch  You could try chess with chunkier pieces Maybe kerplunk  If he like jigsaws you can try putting something slightly sticky like blue tack on the end of a pencil to move the pieces  Not a game but you could also try painting You can get brushes with loads of different sized handles  Guys like these makes my blood boil As a power chair user

you get some relief soon  Have you tried cannabis It really has helped with my nerve pain  Ask for a referral to a pain management doctor or specialist in palliative care You would be surprised what

than gabapentin which is another option   Be strong  I have just accepted to live with it Have had bouts of pain through the night or stretched for 2 days over the last 11 yrs and pressure relieving tactics like push ups on wheelchair making sure I do my CIC   ICC immediately if the pain comes and drinking enough water Sometimes I think it is cuz of the dip in temperature and I try to keep my body warm  I have observed increased pain also follow increased leaks during the night but no UTI I have option to take pain killers but I don t want to do that So I just opt for pressure relief options  aka push ups on wheelchair for 30 seconds or more  or massage around the area where my brain tells the pain is  Ann right on  A pain specialist can really help  The treatment plans and

the lives of people with spinal cord injuries through sports and recreation Join a nationwide community helping make active lifestyles possible for people with spinal cord injuries 2020 Kelly Brush Ride is Saturday Sept 12C6 c7 injury incompleteT7 complete SCI self cath in bed Trunk control or at least psuedo control will take time to develop and strengthen However this should be possible I strongly recommend if you have already not done so to get a hospital bed that is electrically controlled That way your sister can control her inclination and attempt cath at her comfort   I know two months seems like a long time but SCIs take a very long time At T7 this is definitely something that is doable Practice and may be you can consider closed cath kits  they have all of the equipment prepackaged  to simplify the process I personally use Cure Cath after trying a few vendors and they are in my opinion the best   She would need to practice turning so that this becomes easier during the night   I hope this is helpful Not a medical professional so not medical advice Just personal experience Also everyone is a little different so this may work out differently than you expect but I feel it will be something that will happen in the next few months One month at the rehab seems short I m not sure what country you are in but one month wasn t enough to learn my new body and even enough to have some sort of confidence after my sci Your sister will have to learn how to take care of herself and be independent as much as possible for a better quality of life   There are also different catheters that can be explored  See if you can find the country you re in and get a sample or a local dealer   https   www coloplast ca speedicath compact set en ca aspx   It isn t easy She should expect it to take a while to figure out Frustration will be likely But it should be doable   Maybe break the task down into steps This week work on positioning herself next week work on being able to see herself Little victories will be key  Get a smaller mirror The mirror was a game changer for me  Totally do able About one month out is when many people start self cathing because they are a little more stable I really like the speedicath compact set with a bag I definitely use a mirror and prop myself up on two pillows I don t use gloves or iodine I use clean technique rather than sterile technique and that is much more manageable Using a foam wedge or an adjustable bed might be easier than pillows at this stage I hope your sister is going to outpatient therapy at a major rehab hospital The occupational therapist and a nurse can help with this Getting as much independence back as possible is important Your sister should be able to live independently and drive and work but might need a little tough love and the correct home and work adaptations I know I did  You might want to consider getting a hospital bed that can go up down until she gets more trunk control   There s a bunch of different types of catheters She should schedule an appointment with a urologist and they should provide her with a variety to try out   Self cathing in bed is absolutely vital for SCI Once you can do it you can get much more sleep  although it probably won t ever feel like enough  One thing I would recommend is looking for a water proof pad for her to sleep on This will prevent the need for changing the sheets anytime urine leaks Saves a boat load of time and washes   It s a long journey figuring out SCI at the start You re doing the right thing by reaching out and doing research but ultimately a lot of this will be trial and error until she figures out which suggestions work for her  Jeeze out after one month is FAST   Couple things    1 She will absolutely be able to cath herself in bed  and 2 She will absolutely be able to cath on the toilet from her chair eventually   However both these things take practice Don t bother with a hospital bed They re huge and expensive and in a couple of months she won t need one   Start with male catheters  longer and give you more control  and urinal bottle  curved up at the end to prevent spillage  and mirror She should be able to easily cath herself with those tools  after propping herself up on some pillows      When she gets stronger and her pain levels allow she can start practicing cathing from her chair sitting up with male catheters and or eventually on the toilet with female catheters This process is frustrating AF and will take a long time but she ll get there     Feel free to DM me I m T7 8 complete 15 years post I ve got two little kids am a full time lawyer and life is awesome My injury was a nightmare and it took me 8 months to get out of hospital rehab   I ve also got some excellent FB community recommendations for her but I won t share them publicly here  I m protective of them and don t want weirdos who might be lurking in the sub to know where they are   Until she can manage to get it done from her chair on or at the toilet this can definitely work  Without some sitting uprightness though its tough not to leave residuals cathing when lying down  Doing that for too long is a recipe for UTI often recurring  Be careful about that and be sure to get some way of emptying the bladder entirely  Lying down makes this very hard  I know it comes with risk but using a foley at night time is a lot easier and you can actually get a full nights sleep And I personally have to urinate a lot more frequently when laying down vs sitting up  Male   T12 complete July 2019  It s very possible for her to be able to do it herself The both of you will just need to be patient with the learning process   As far as supplies go    look into hydrophilic catheters This ll help eliminate some steps you ll need to do each time and make things faster for both of you   If you don t have some already look into 2 000ml urinary bags for her This ll help reduce the number of times you ll need to drain the bags for her I use one from Medline and I only need to drain it in the morning    For the first few tires look into getting a incontinence pad from Amazon that you can have on the bed so if she makes a mistake it ll be easier to clean up spills or messes  Tip I got from the nurse  if the one meant for humans are too expensive for you the doggy training pads work too   I just bought a reusable one and just wash it   For positioning since my bed is along the wall I put some pillows along the wall for cushioning and get into a somewhat leaned back position  nurse said it should be anywhere between 30 to 60 degree angle  There are beds that will recline for you but that s expensive  avg  800   Once I get a feeling that I m ok I go ahead and start the process   Sadly I am saying this in a male perspective but I hope that ll give you some direction to go with If you have Facebook there are many Spinal cord injury groups that can help too It s absolutely possible and she need not worry But rehab for at least 3 months is important and necessary for her to learn everything Even after 11 yrs I think I should visit rehab once more just to hone my skills and learn something new better But I will advise against any reclining bed special mattress of any form to avoid pressure sores It is important that she is aware of the seriousness of pressures sores and ensures she doesn t get any And special mattress and reclining beds are more likely to give that And so is prolonged wetness in private areas at night   I although do not do self cath in bed The last call is always in the restroom and then I hit the bed Depending on the weather I assess if I will need diapers or not And on days when my calculations go wrong I learn Now on the wrong side of 30 so I have to change this habit Trying to figure alternate and avoid having leaks since it is time to take better care of myself   But as fat as your sis goes you must urge to go for a longer rehab stint Life will drastically improve and the trunk balance short cuts also she will learn There is no way around it Until then follow some of those female wheelchair users in instagram so she sees that she can lead a better life and also probably do some of the easier exercises at the comfort of home  T2 t3 I have a power bed and sit up I also have a rolling hospital table I set everything up on  I placed a light on the under side of the table so as not to wake my partner  T8 9 SCI this Jan and was discharged around Apr I used to do intermittent cath in rehab hospital but when I got home it was just too troublesome and I kept leaking so I switched to indwelling cath Best decision ever it s so convenient and clean   One month at the rehab seems short  Agreed it seems insanely short tbh   Also OP look into a bed that can recline the top part of the bed since you said that she barely has any trunk control can be a bit costly though   I spent 2 weeks in the ICU and 3 weeks in rehab lol Medicare told me to gtfoWhat was life like for SCI people before the invention of wheelchair to post World War 2 Let spasmsThat s called  spasticity  and it is super common with SCI  Oral Baclofen is the most common medication to address it  Some have it so bad they have a Baclofen pump installed to constantly meter out doses  Knockout You are doing the right thing to do all you can to stretch and stay limber  The human body was built to move not to sit  Unfortunately SCI puts most of us in a very sedentary situation   Often times muscle relaxers are prescribed to help prevent spasms the tight muscles and pain  But like all drugs side effects come along with the benefits  Tell your doctor about your symptoms just like you wrote in your post  Your doc may give you a muscle relaxer to try  See if they help especially at night so you can get better sleep  Welcome to the fun world of leg spasms I m pretty sure mine start the moment I launch Apex Legends and jump everytime I need to aim  I have a standing frame and I use it daily but what has solved leg spasms for me  I am completely off all meds   no baclofen tizanidine or benzodiazepines  has been an estim bike  I have a myolyn bike and the support is amazing  and a vibration plate    I used to have a really amazing vibration plate that fit under my standing frame but it broke  was used when I got it  and I can t find another one that s thin enough  I stole the idea from someone on carecure  Do you use your standing frame  Because my equipment rep told me that the usage for SCI is under 50    I have terrible leg spasms and even my abs will get tight  I use my standing frame every day for for 45   90 min It does wonders for helping control spasms  I also stretch when I m not being lazy  I actually get on the floor and stretch like they made ya in gym class lol I know that s not an option for all SCI tho   You could also talk to your rehab doc about Botox injections You have to go get them every 3 months tho but they def seem to help me   I still have to take baclifen but doing all this helps you keep the dosage down Because IDK about everyone else but the shit makes me tired  I have this same issue and I have to take baclofen 3 times daily for it I also just had a knee surgery because I tore my ACL and my leg spasms are causing me a LOT of problems as a result  I m t4 t6 incomplete walker I get leg spasms all the time I stopped baclofen a few months ago because I read it could make my progress harder to achieve so I just deal with the spasms I was only on it for a few months anyway I ve noticed that my level of exhaustion affects the severity of my spasms If I get little to no sleep the night before my spasms are crazy jerky and violent and I could injure someone if they re near my legs at that time I ll also be barely able to shuffle the next day because my legs will want to constantly give out  Like they said it s spasticity It s your body trying to protect your bones better because most paraplegics and quadriplegics have osteopenia or osteoporosis from the hip on down Stretching and baclofen are key to helping discomfort My spasms will twist me up so bad I need to have my PT manipulate my hip It s probably better to see a chiropractor I m a T12 L1 incomplete for about 3 5 years and recently my pain has been through the roof I need to stretch a lot just to function It s basically a full time job Meds and stretch Meds and stretch  I want to add that for me personally I put an ice pack on my tailbone and it usually stops the spasms That might just be me though And if you have no sensation you need to be careful because ice burns are not fun I ve gotten one because I can t feel the skin that well around my tailbone  Without a doubt marijuana has been the most effective at stopping my spasms  I m in 20mg baclofen 3x a day and tizanidine added to it I really don t want a pump though haha yeah it s the worst when trying to game and your legs cause your hand to move your mouse or controller accidentally   No I used one in rehab but there is no where near me that has one and they are to expensive to buy my own Short term caregiver Yeah sounds a little crazy but a few weeks before I go somewhere I ll

sleeping If there are contractures then you need surgery and possibly the same splints afterwards  Quad here My right hand was closed almost like a fist post injury Docs recommended a tendon transfer I can t remember if they took my tendons from my fingers or tendons from my palm but it was pretty successful compared to how it was   Theirs still a slight curl but I can stretch the out straight and able to pick things up and hold things in my hand Not my fingers but my foot spasms up and stays there I force stretch it as far as I can a couple of times a day  Your SCI doctor can also do Botox injections to relax the muscles and help stretch them out  Having my fingers completely straight would decrease my independence  That curl can be really useful  Hello  There are splints one can get  I am not sure if you get them from the doctor or can get online  Probably have to go to a prostetic place due to needing correct size  Toes of 1 of my feet are bent Cuz of which i am unable to wear shoes Sometime back my ex suggested I should wear bigger size shoes Since I am tall I don t get bigger shoes that I can purchase Normally wear UK 11 now have to look for 12 or 13 which aren t easily available But for your fingers bent are a boon My closest bud is a quad and cuz his fingers aren t bent he says it s much easier to hold spoons drive and hold things  As an incomplete para I have that issue with some of my toes  As far as I know there is no way to permanently fix it but I ve found that toe socks help  while they are one anyway    Perhaps some type of glove  I agree with this my therapists in rehab actually taped my hands to get them to curl a bit and now I can grip things quite well between my thumb and forefinger joints I also get a therapist twice a week to stretch them out and keep them loose they remain relatively curled thoughI figured it s time for a poll on mobility aids What do you use most of the time Firefly for zipping about town  A tribute to all the SCI

that are large and have texture Or try quad push gloves that have texture on them   consider having your axle adjusted rearward Keep in mind if you do this it will affect how the chair pushes on flat ground It will also require re calibrating the caster square and the wheel locks   they make winches for vans to help pull a chair up a ramp I don t know how much they cost but you hook the chair to it and it pulls you up a ramp   Good luck  an electric winch  Something that my husband is considering mostly because we have a wheelchair bound acquaintance who uses this is a SmartDrive attachment This guy mostly relies on his own arm power to get around but his impairments extend to his upper body as well so he has a SmartDrive to help give him a boost on steep inclines This extends to his van which he rolls into then transfers into the driver s seat which swivels  If you re in a manual chair and like it I d suggest an E fix It makes your manual power  Go backwards  I am  not  strong and

years ago when I went to the bathroom I noticed my left testicle was swollen quiet large I went to the ER where they did a sonogram on my nut My Dr said I had gotten an infecrion and explained to me

com products dolphin fis     On the Dolphin bed there is a setting used when moving a patient which firms up the entire bed to make it easier Before turning or moving a patient the nurse would press the button wait a few seconds then perform the necessary movement The bed would automatically return to its previous setting in a few minutes   See if you can find and download the owner s manual for your bed I did this and was more knowledgeable than my nurses on operating the bed  It does take a little while for air mattresses to firm up  Also consider pulling him over towards you so that he will be not centered but have more space on the side he s going to be facing  Then you can put some pillows or quad pads between him and the bed rail side of the bed  I did try this but had the same issue Perhaps I didn t wait long enough though I ll try it again tonight  waiting a few minutes before trying the turn Thank you for your input It s really appreciated Thank you   My SCI StoryI m T 6 also with horrible Clonus Try CBD but tell your doc who is Rx ing the Baclofen  Take it all day by day don t look ahead Like the advice to marathon runners look at your feet and keep running Don t look ahead to the horizon and become discouraged by how far you have left to travel  That is actually great progress in that span of time That level of improvement in 6 weeks is very promising I was a C2 incomplete back in 2010 and initially couldn t move a thing 6 7 weeks later I could walk with a cane like 90 year old man  very weak and poor balance   Today I am a physical therapist and have some residual weakness and clonus I cannot run and walking can be somewhat challenging on certain terrain  downhill is the worst  but you would never be able to tell unless you were specifically looking for something I live a fairly normal life   If I can give you one piece of advice it would be to treat your rehab exercises like it is your job and you are a pro athlete You need frequency and

was in shock or denial for so long that I didn t even know that I was paralyzed until about three weeks later while in inpatient That s right you better not give up It s so unfair and almost unethical that they d tell us something like that because ultimately  every spinal cord injury is different   Keep going friendWhats the best kind of MattressThat depends on how tolerable your skin is and if you get bed sores easily In rehab they told me that I d have to sleep in a specialized bed For SCI memory foam mattress would be the best But tbh I sleep on a Tempurpedic like mattress and have no issues with bed sores or back pain But I sleep on my side or stomach and never on my back to take off the pressure of siting during the day I then bought a bed frame off overstock they let s me tilt the head up and legs up when I play games and watch tv and stuff  T 1 Para 40 yrs on Latex mattress s NO springs never had a sore  Natural 100  Latex is also dust mite proof   comfortable  It s prob overkill but I m low air loss every day Had a stage 4 sacrum wound right outta the hospital If you guys have ever gone to a wound clinic for 6 months I m sure you understand the paranoia Never going through that again if I can help it  I like firm spring mattresses I ve tried the memory foam ones and since they conform to pressure there s no  surface  to push against so it makes it so much harder to function like turning transferring and getting dressed I had a spring one for years and when I needed to replace it I bought a firm tempurepedic I didn t go a month and I exchanged it for a firm spring   I ve never had a bed sore I get dysreflexic so I sweat as a warning when I m on my side too long  I have a soft mattress with a pillow top Works well for me   Best thing to do is go with a friend to a bed shop Lie on a mattress for 20 mins then get the friend to check for red marks  The best mattress is one that s the most comfortable for you while not leaving bed sores If you re prone to sores or already have them you should be on a good alternating pressure low air loss mattress The cheaper you go the louder they will be and pop more often   Before my injury I loved my memory foam but especially after my injury it felt too soft and I would wake up sore After sleeping on a hotel sping I discovered they were my new favorite Just got to find what works for you    Also keep in mind height compared to your chair I actually spent extra for low profile box springs to drop my bed to the same height as my chair highly reccomend I ll second this Memory foam with an adjustable frame works well for me but lately I ve needed to add a 3 inch foam topper because of autonomic dysreflexia problems I made a sub for people with mobility aids to meet talk and make memes My parapalegic gf shot herself sitting next to me Im crushed First I am incredibly sorry for your loss Secondly it is NOT your fault You did everything you could and there is no guilt that belongs to you AT ALL Depression like that is horrible and there s a lot of imbalance going on chemically that has not a thing to do with you You did everything right by loving her and inviting her into your next home I cannot imagine the shock you were and likely are still in Please seek counseling You must talk to a professional That s not negotiable friend Please make that happen I was apprehensive about therapy at first and now I really embrace it  Best of luck going forward I know it s got to be so difficult right now but again remember you gave love to her and that s the best thing anyone can do  I m sorry she did this and did it in front of you Talk to someone ASAP Please come back here anytime you want to talk or vent  I m so sorry for your loss  What you have been through is absolutely devastating Please reach out to friends and family and get some professional help and support There is help available and you absolutely qualify for it  I am getting psych help and therapy  It is way harder to get in to see someone than it should be  She was a punker and we both hated the way US healthcare worked and the stigma behind getting mental help  She loved nature and the bit of independence she had  Ever since her surgery being in a car hurt her bad  With everything closed she couldnt see her friends  I think it was all too much  The last thing she wrote in her journal was the full  Fear is the mindkiller  quote Ive got to put it here so maybe it will help someone else struggling  I love you all  I cant read it without crying    I must not fear Fear is the mind killer Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration I will face my fear I will permit it to pass over me and through me And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path Where the fear has gone there will be nothing Only I will remain   I m so sorry for your loss But you re not guilty I can t imagine what you re going through right now I m so sorry  I am so sorry for your loss  That s so awful I m so sorry You are not in any way guilty  This is not your fault When someone is suicidal it s a whole different state of mind  It s possible she didn t realize how hurtful that act would be to you  She just wasn t thinking straight I do hope you take everyone s advice and talk to someone not just reddit Any human would need help processing something like this I wish you the best  I m very sorry for your loss I don t know all the details but I m sure she s in a better place now and has found mercy from her pain There hopefully can be some solace in that at least She also was probably done with being a dependent It s a scary way to live   be in pain have to depend on others especially in America where our healthcare system is set up against us   Maybe look into talking to some people who are close to you to try and navigate through your grief   Peace Oh my gosh I m so sorry for your loss This is not your fault and there was nothing that you  should  have done You loved her and provided a safe trusted space to the extent that you knew she needed one   Some demons seem too much to overcome when you re mired in depression and people with depression are really good at hiding it   Much love to you Feel free to reach out if you want to talk  I am so very sorry for your loss My heart goes out to you Please do not hesitate to reach out if you d like someone to talk to  She was suffering I believe now she is at peace I m so sorry for your loss Please seek support The grief subreddits are great  3C2 fracture at 18 years old can someone experienced walk me through a this Where are you located let s see if we can find some local voices Man I had my injury at 31 but I was definitely still peaking It was awful to feel like I lost my whole life and things were very dark for awhile Once I hit rock bottom things got a lot better and I haven t looked back How s your mobility and everything  probably not i live in turkey I just wanted to talk to someone about this whole thing that s allThere s no loss in movement But there s a numb area on my left chest and there are these pins and needles feeling in my left arm sometimesBladderDid they have you on a catheter that sayed in you and was attached to a urin bag  Because what happens is because u used to hold it and go every 4 hour ur body was used to it and had some muscles due to use of it  But when u have the other one whenever u have liquid in ur blatter then it goes out right away your no longer holding it so ur body go used to just letting it out  Try to hold it in for 4 hours if possible but if needed do it 3 hrs so ur body gets used to being on a schedule again   Common after having an indwelling catheter for a while Give it time and it should get better  Thanks for the answers   I went to the doctor and he thinks its something in between   The catheter and maybe a virus in my urine   He gave me some medication hope it works  How s your fluid intake Any change in pattern Did you change the tube you are using Measure within how many hours you are leaking and share Could probably give some pointers This is too narrow an input to share any feedback  Got invited to a new accessible hiking path that was not very  accessibleHad the same experience   Accessible  trails with loose dirt steep  for us  slopes or are not maintained and get covered with beach sand or they re too narrow and barely fit a chair or    my favorite    they ve got those zig zag entrance paths that are supposed to block bikes or horses or whatever but of course they block us too   I don t even know if I d say it s great they they re simply trying because it sucks to go online and see a trail listed as accessible then pack up and drive to it only to discover it s really not  I don t recommend visiting any of the  accessible  fishing spots scattered around Montana  If anyone is in Utah the folks at Neuroworx are 100  reliable on what s truly accessible and they are really big supporters advocates of accessible outdoor activities and sports  Yeah you are right It s super frustrating I think if this was a trail that was listed online as accessible and I took the time to go there only to find the things you listed I d be ripped I guess I cut them some slack because they asked me to come test it and give feedback on what worked and what didn t and how they can improve it I wanted to say want to make it accessible Build wood paths haha those are the best kinds of trails I ve been on in my injury experience Oh man I m in Massachusetts I went to a local accessible fishing spot that had an  accessible dock  this thing was on a cliff haha accessible for a bird maybe Numbness on a part of my shoulder chest area after c2 fracture Pls helpAll injuries are different My thumb is numb since my accident No reason why  Have you been evaluated for a brachial plexus injury  The testing is a lot of zapping with various levels of discomfort but it s worth exploring because then you can plan around recovery  Have you used massage as a tool in your recovery I am 2 years post incomplete spinal cord injury and massage and chiro is a massive part of my pain treatment The only thing I worry about in your dad s case is how fresh the injury is I would 100  check with the dr to make sure it s ok to be massaged so soon I waited at least 9 or 10 months before I would have been able to handle lying on a massage bed but everyone s injury is different It depends on the levels and if there were any other injuries  Not much experience but I tried massaging partners feet and it set his phantom nerve pain off like crazy  But anything is worth a try  I have had massage both in acute rehab and afterwards and found it really helpful  The only caution I would offer is if he has nerve pain the stimulation may trigger some hypersensitivity so be aware of any wrinkles positioning issues before and after  I use a massage gun on my legs every single day and it help immensely Decreases my soreness from PT and tightness that my muscles get from tone  Look into deep tissue massage It is very helpful keeping muscles loose and keeping pain down I spent 8 years going to a regular massage therapist and I regret it although it did help I would have been able to prevent damage if I went to a deep tissue massage therapist all that time They understand anatomy and how things are connected Not sure if he had hardware but over time our bodies adapt to having hardware and can change how that area operates I would advise any newly injured person to try DTM and acupuncture  You know what else I found really helpful is dry needling  Depending on where you are it might be a PT or an acupuncturist or a massage therapist but I found 1 incredibly painful but it doesn t hurt for long and was completely worth it because 2 huge increases in range of motion  I use a theragun during PT sessions to help my scaps be less tight as being in a chair those muscles get super tight and then at night I use a head massager on my legs to try and send a signal from down to up Since signals are sent from the brain down it s also nice to try and send them the other way Massaging also helps with spasms and keeping muscles loose I wasn t able to feel vibrations two months ago and now I can feel vibrations and sometimes the massage device it self on my upper thighs I m 9 months post  Thanks I think we will check with his original surgeon on his follow up appointment in 2 weeks The massage therapist is willing to massage him while he s in the wheelchair which I thought could be a nice start I hate dry needling but it is worth it afterwords Just hate when they shake the needle a little to loosen muscle My gf used to slowly lose sensation in her fingers and dry needling periodically helped her immensely Thanks for this My chiropractor did mention acupuncture Curious do you do it in the areas where you have no feeling He has no movement from his chest down Would the needling acupuncture be done in his legs Or more in his arms shoulders etc   I tried dry needling on my neck last year after having pain for months It was terrifying to me but I would be willing to try again  Does having a spinal cord injury make you feel old Brother I m in my 40s and live in an assisted living facility  You have no idea But don t feel bad those years at the end of your life that are getting shaved off are the ones you don t want anyway      shrug   it is what it is I had an opportunity to take a well paid job in NYC but knew that during the winter I would have a lot of problems navigating the streets Plus I would either have a suck ass car commute or do the subway which is a gamble in a chair  elevators breaking all the time  Thats life in a chair  I feel old everyday now I ve only recently started to walk again but it s not walking it s toddling and only short distances Everything below injury feels stiff and wrong or it doesn t feel at all I feel like I m 80 instead of 44    I m in the same situation right now Yes 100  After my first surgery I had a lot of issues with my joints below the waist My arthritis would flare up and my knees and ankles were always stiff It hurt to stretch I walked with a cane and I had to limp everywhere Fast forward 7 years to my most recent surgery and the answer is still yes The stiffness in my joints and the pain while stretching is much better except it s taking forever to heal Also this time I could walk right afterward My first surgery left me paralyzed for a few months   Having to use a cane park in handicap spaces and use the electric carts is all embarrassing People look at me like I m faking That doesn t bother me as much as it used to but it makes me feel old  I m 30 and have hip issues that are quite painful so yeah  T5 6 complete coming up to 33 years SCI  I m 63  Yeah feeling physically older than your years seems to be part of the deal Using a manual wheelchair actually helps a lot the aches and pains subside a bit after the first mile but the downside is that arms are not legs and that shoulders wear out after 25 years or so  I had a complete rupture of both LHS rotator cuff tendons about 7 years ago beyond realistic repair    I did work full time for about 20 years up until a couple of years ago which didn t particularly help my health but took my mind off the crap mostly and kept me moving I have more issues now since I retired although they may have been coming anyway  Not until I decided to feel old that I feel old Until last year I was all for crazy parties all nighters and everything And then after realizing that I have hit 32 suddenly there was a flip switch that turn it seems like that now I think I feel old There is a mental block that a person develops psychologically which has a major role to play than just physiological reasons You are as old as you want to feel yourself to be  Are there people your age there Or is it all elderly  Oh my God I completely forgot about this I ve had so many job offers that I had to turn down because just being there in a wheelchair was not viable Did your sexual function sensation or desire return over time after your injury How long did it take and how much did it return We have a pretty similar level of injury  I m L5 S1   I had zero sexual function for about six months after my injury I couldn t feel anything at all Mine did gradually come back but it took time and I m pretty convinced that toys played a big role in that I learned how to orgasm without sensation at first and that seemed to be a trigger to having sensation come back like my body was re learning those connection I m sure some of it was also just a natural improvement over time but I still have areas elsewhere with no sensation so I don t think it s completely unfounded   There are toys designed for spinally injured men though I can t remember the name at the moment Hopefully someone will be able to help You could also have a look at the  hummingbird  attachment for the Hitachi wand designed for men I ve heard a couple of guys say that it was effective for them  My injury is T12 L5 incomplete It took me almost 2 years after injury to orgasm again I think it also had to do with my greatly lessening the amount of opiate painkillers I was prescribed at the time  which would be 2008 09  because I got a full erection I could feel  after kinda having a couple here and there  and I masturbated successfully Although I can t walk or even stand I have some movement on my left side but it s spotty and my feeling in my penis isn t 100  but it s enough and I am able to masturbate to completion  T8 complete No return of sexual function and really since I can orgasm I don t see the point in trying to hook up  Ability is really hard to judge because SCI s differ so much between complete and incomplete injuries and level of injury   I can tell ya my story tho lol I spent the first 5 years not being able to maintain an erection or orgasm ejaculate Until I started surfing forums and learned some things to try Now I use a tens unit to orgasm ejaculate pretty regularly  I also went to the urologist about ED and we found a solution that worked for me I now use a tri mix injection that s pretty much an instant 2 hr hard on lol Which some women have loved tri mix is relatively affordable 80  can last me over 6 months    Now I m a t5 complete para so no feeling at all below injury That being said I do get some weird tingly sensations with stimulation And when I do orgasm it does feel like a relief sensation  And I feel like I still get that good feeling in your head after where you get the flood of endorphins etc    I was a horny MFer before my injury and that has changed very little for me lol With the tri mix injection and the intimate rider along with the other items in my adult toy box I feel my sex life is as close to normal as it can be    Like 60  or more of SCI are able to orgasm ejaculate after injury Be it with a medical grade ferticare vibrator or other ways I posted a video earlier that kinda talked about a lot of it  Yes and no   I have erectile dysfunction now so that has never changed   As far as desire my desire is on the mental and it s not physical Sex is something that I want to do but it s not a physical urge anymore   I think the best way to describe it for me is the best analogy is the transition becoming a runner or a gym rat At first you want to go to the gym or you want to run Eventually it becomes physical and you just kind of have to do it That physical side is no longer there  Pretty much the same   took me 6 months feeling isn t as good but it works Advice for fixing wheelchair posture  T4 complete If you are T4 complete the muscles needed to maintain a fully upright position are not innervated You should see a seating specialist for a better seating setup With the right wheelchair configuration cushion and backrest you should be able to propel reach whatever you need to do with both arms while still sitting with good posture There are simple fixes  like adding dump to your wheelchair  more moderate solutions  more contoured backrest  and complex solutions  fully customized seating system like RIDE  You already got some great advice I just wanted to add that if you push a manual chair your muscles in the pec area tend to get more developed and can tighten up which actually pulls your shoulders inward and gives them that rounded shape that many manual users get  Try workouts that develop muscles around the upper back and shoulder blades basically areas that are not worked out by pushing a chair    Also try opening up the tension in your chest muscles by stretching them I do this in bed  I lay on my side  and partially toward my back pillows may be needed behind hips for support  and let one bent arm fall back behind me while squeezing my shoulder blades together 2 4 times for 10 seconds then repeat for the other side  Or any way you can find to stretch the area could help  Everyone has given solid advice the only thing I would add is that if you do not have a solid back to your chair that would be the place to start Also not sure how others feel but having armrests on a manual chair as a t4 sounds fishy That would mess up my pushing hard out I would consider how your situation would change without them Great question   After nearly 40 years in a chair I look like the letter  C   And I m 6 7  I  used  to have wonderful posture I ve been weightlifting since before my injury  my back muscles are amply strong But as others have noted there just aren t enough muscles still working in the  right  areas to help me straighten out   Best wishes on your endeavor  I don t know about workouts but a proper wheelchair setup with the right amount of dump the right cushion and a rigid backrest potentially with deep contour is where I would start  Feet leg placement in the chair can also affect the rotation of your hips which feed into your posture and lumbar lordosis as well   It is surprising a rehab PT says they can t do anything to help  That sounds weird  Are they RESNA ATP certified as a seating specialist  How high is the back on your wheelchair and is it almost straight I have a hard time maintaining a straight posture in a wheelchair that has a back that is too high that doesn t have lumbar support A wheelchair back that sits lower and contacts less of my upper back allows me to sit straighter  I m a t5 complete and I just ordered a tilite titanium ergo seating chair When I was testing them it was like night and day the difference between the ergo seating and my chair now When it finally gets done I ll post a pic on here  If you have the capability of pulling your shoulders back so that your shoulder blade pinch inward then I may be able to strengthen it a bit and improve some but I d also see if you could maybe get a small back brace because prolonged poor posture can cause serious issues later on in life  Thank you so much I didn t know there were seating specialists I ll look into that My doctor pretty much gave up on me which is strange because my case isn t as severe as others  Thanks Thank you so much I appreciate the help so so much Yep I aired out my concerns about the armrests but my parents who were paying for the wheelchair insisted on them Hoping to get a better wheelchair based on the advice here Thank you so much Thank you for the wheelchair advice I wish wheelchairs were less expensive in my country accessible devices aren t covered by any insurance Thank you Will also check out seating specialists My doctor basically gave up on me lolThank you so much It s pretty high imo and way too soft probably why my back hurts so often hahaThank you so much Is the back brace you re thinking of similar to an abdominal binder or something stiffer Yet another girl rejected meDating with SCI is tough if you are  getting function back  that probably means you are fairly recently injured I would focus on my recovery date when you are in a more stable place Hey so you ve had some good advice about dating with an SCI already so I just wanted to add that Match com has been sued by the FTC for false advertising and fake profiles If you want to keep online dating maybe try other sites like Hinge or Bumble  Tinder is owned by the same people as Match  I ve found Tinder to be good overall because it has the most people of any dating app in most areas but there s also a high proportion of crap to be honest     I agree that taking a bit of time to focus on yourself and your recovery is a good idea as well You could even put some of the money you would be spending on dating towards therapy   it may not be your bag but honestly I didn t realise how badly I needed therapy after my injury It was more traumatic and had a bigger impact on my mental health than I expected So if you think it might be helpful maybe try it out   dating takes a lot of resilience so I think therapy can only help with that  I m sorry you are going through this I can assure you speaking as a T12   L1 incomplete   that there are many women out there that wouldn t see your disability as a deal breaker or even an issue at all   I ve had many flings one night stands and a few committed relationships since my accident In fact I m currently in one that is rapidly approaching the one year mark   I also have many friends who are in wheelchairs who live fulfilling romantic lives   It s definitely possible     You have to first have confidence in yourself love you for who  you  are  Don t give up and don t settle brother You are worth it and you deserve happiness don t ever stop searching until you find someone who lights your soul on fire  You will find somebody one day who can look beyond your disability and appreciate you for what you are Sure there are things you ll never be able to do but look on the positive side My injury is worse than yours  C5  and I m happily married to an able bodied person I have limited mobility in my arms and am a full time user    There s still many things I can t do And maybe won t be able to do ever   Speaking as someone who is not physically disabled but has chronic illnesses I have thought similarly I can see why you would think of those  particularly now  but focus on what you  can  do and any alternative ways to do what you can t On the subject of dating you can still go out for dinner bring a girl flowers and talk with her for hours     What do I have to give   More than you can possibly imagine at the moment You can still give her your heart and a lifetime of happiness that she would not be able to get from anyone else I agree with the others that you should focus on you right now You will discover a lot more about yourself to love be proud of and better   Good luck out there  It s been two years so yeah fairly recent I ve thought about only waiting to begin dating again after I m more independent and can walk on my own but I m not sure how long that ll take Two years is already a long time without any kind of physical or emotional satisfaction I m not sure how much longer I can take  I wanted to second the therapy idea I know it is super intimidating to make the first step to  go see someone   But it is really helpful after such a major physical life change The way I thought about myself pre therapy compared to after therapy was very different   I think that getting to know yourself and making personal goals for yourself with the help of a therapist will put you in a better space in life to meet your person   I know it helped me find the potential I couldn t see in myself I was already with someone at the time But our relationship was pretty rocky at times After I started working on myself we got a lot better together We are happily married now   There are some online options for reaching a therapist and I m sure lots locally to you betterhelp com and talkspace com are a couple that I know of that have good reviews   I wish you the very best Neuralink livestream from last night  seriously talking about a cure for sci Thoughts the first thing I will do is to go and have a nice pee in the bush Hope  It s so often that we see articles where scientists have made some kind of breakthrough and there s some sort of glimmer of hope in our world but this is different I think this is real I ve been following NeuraLink For a long time now A few years ago I read a huge essay on the company It s really exciting to actually see something that one day might be implanted in humans   I had a really down day yesterday and it s really nice seeing this today  I don t see any reason why the signals can t be transferred between two of this devices located opposite sides of scar tissue on spinal cord It s been proven that below the site of injury signals can be transmitted since surgery is so precise that it goes between the blood vessels hence not causing bleeding and damage to tissue i don t see why they shouldn t be able to install lets say 3 or 4 of this babies below the injury I d volunteer early but unfortunately there s not enough urgency to help paralyzed people Nobody understands the daily physical and emotional pain we have to endure That said this is exciting news can t wait for first human trials Mark my words whoever gets this install will regain some movement on day 1 of the trials Hope FDA doesn t slow them down  Eventually sure Probably sooner than economical fusion power plants but it ll be a fairly close race  There have been other non corporate agencies working on similar technologies What Musk seemed to show didn t seem to be an estimated reality more advanced than what already exists it looked like a way to prepare the public to want and buy his products  he even is interested in having you buy upgrades before they even exist      These devices should be advertised in a medical setting not a corproate one Not saying not to have hope but be weary of CEO promises Can t wait to see what they have once they have a full team Right now they have 100 Imagine 10 000 employees That s the target Not expecting it to be a cure but I told myself if anyone o wanted to work on a solution for sci it would be Elon musk  I think it s a very promising therapy and unlike the go2 system also has the potential to treat complete injuries Very exciting stuff I d like to feel the sand between my toes or my feet on grass again Those days are inevitable unfortunately Even when we re handling business exercising daily eating right  you ll get that feeling like you re on a high roller coaster You look down like  what in the actual fk happened to me   Keep swinging brother    a little hope always helpsIn other words not very soonI am medically considered the highest level quadriplegic possible at   C0   no one is higher than me I can not feel or move anything from the chin down I basically only have face movement I was paralyzed three years ago in a car accident But I am so happy to be alive  What a beautiful picture I love the flowers you have growing on your front porch So vibrantly red     Well damn  I smoked not too long ago and got pretty high but you take the cake  Well look at you up on your HIGH horse  P I m happy you re alive too Keep rocking it  Congratulations   but seriously you look fantastic Love that smile  Decided to play life on hardcore mode I see Respect  Youre awesome  Hats off to you  C4  Beautiful smile and beautiful spirit  Hello Pink I envy your positive attitude  How do you do it  My situation pales in comparison to you   I have a chronic pain condition caused by rheumatoid arthritis of the spine  Ankylosing Spondylitis  and a back surgery gone wrong resulting in a debilitating disease named Acute Adhesive Arachnoiditis  It causes scar tissue and globular like cysts to form within the spine and around spinal nerves  Above the waist I am OK except for pain  Below the waist my legs don t function so well lost a lot of feeling in lower legs and feet  I have a lot of intense pain in my legs which seems strange since I can t feel much anymore  It is a struggle to balance myself I really have to be careful of falling  I can barely walk using canes or a walker  My situation is progressive meaning as time passes my situation is getting worse   Enough about me  I hope your situation is stable pain free  and that you have a good support system  Most of all I hope you are able to find ways to make you happy  Winner     You Are Awesome Good vibes coming your way You have an amazing attitude and I m grateful that I saw your post We often take things for granted in our day to day lives including just being alive itself   My journey was inspired by phenomenal people with the same positive outlook at you and my journey continues because of reminders like the one you shared today   I wish you both happiness and love and thank you again for making a difference in my day Elon Mask is doing neuralink presentation on YouTube literally while I m typing this Try to get in touch with them Those are my Mom s flowers She loves gardening I have no neuropathic pain so I live pain free I am sorry about your situation In terms of me staying positive well some days I am not so positive But I do try to keep my spirits up by looking forward to the future How are you managing your arachnoiditis I have it too from a stupid spinal tap I got my first vehicle after having my accident Congratulations on your ride I had a 1998 dodge caravan with no modification just the middle seat was taken away so i can pull my wheelchair up without having to fold or break it down  it worked fine for me until my transmission busted I now use readiwheels for when i want to go somewhere i just call a day ahead  if i need to feel the road agien i rent a car from Getaround and use my portable handcontrols  I recently switched from driving a car for 35 yrs to a van because my shoulders can t make the transfer anymore I ve owned just about every 2 door model out there to put the folding chair behind the seat No doubt the van has advantages for wheelchair drivers BUT I really miss the early pick up speed gas mileage with a car   the biggest factor PARKING is absolutely horrible with the van  With a side ramp it s really tough to use a regular handicapped spot because people park over the lines   your unable to get your ramp out   Good Luck ANY vehicle is our freedom out into the world so enjoy  Congratulations  Thats a good news story   ALRIGHT Congrats   So true And the reason I went with the van is partly because of your issue  the shoulders I ve heard too many horror stories of people needing rotator cuff surgery while in wheelchairs It s a beast and I m used to cars as well It s definitely a learning curve Does anyone else enjoy bladder spasms That s cool man I m still trying to figure out how to ejaculate I m 2 years post c5 complete I ve tried just about everything including a  800 ferticare Funny thing is I get the most pleasure and feel I get the closest by just rubbing on it through a pair of thin gym shorts lol Sounds weird but it helps with the friction kinda hard to explain but I m hoping one day I finally get to the  end  Either way it feels pretty damn good   That s really interesting and like you said I d take it Isn t crazy how  weird  our bodies can be Can t say I ve heard anyone else feel the same thing as you But hey you never know could be the next post  Hi I m pretty new to the subreddit and I m interested in learning more about SCI especially as it relates to the bladder    what s your opinion been of suprapubic catheters Do you still use a bag to collect urine similar to Foley intermittent catheters  Yes I use a medium leg bag during the day and a night bag overnight Catheters generally suck but I have no other options I suppose Sorry for taking so long to get back to you Quadriplegic Vlog   Can you exercise from a wheelchair Agreed I m up at 5 pushing around my neighborhood  and I m the only one out there Keep crushing it     Thank you you too man Quads what do you drive Not a Quad but I did just get a Subaru Crosstrek and I absolutely love it Can t wait for the snow  Love my Subaru Outback Not sure what to doNew netflix disabled sports documentaryI watched this just a couple of hours ago and it was pretty interesting Not entirely based with SCI more varying impairments and some history of the paralympics but pretty good overall  I am a paraplegic T 7 sex positive woman After years of being embarrassed by my body I have finally grown confidence and I am now a sex worker I work mostly with devotees I try to educate people about sexuality n disablities so that we can be seen as sexual beings and not just a disablity PM meRad shirt  May I ask what is a  devotee   The shirt and pants are rad and all but why is no one addressing the awesome hamburger socks Even more so I m in love with your tattoos   Thank you for being open for the rest of us  representation in all dynamics really is important I hope you don t mind I ve DMed you  I am sorry about your paraplegia but ever happy for your new found pride and confidence  That s cool you have turned your situation into a revenue generator  As the saying goes when life hands you lemons make lemonade   Are your clients mostly other paras and quads  Or persons who have a wheelchair fetish   I m sure you are careful but please protect yourself from STD s and especially all the creeps out there  Everyone is commenting on the shirt and I am too I fucking love NOFX since like  95 when I was 15 Now I m 41 and paraplegic since 2006 and loving that you also love NOFX Yeah for being a sex worker Under appreciated for sure  Who the hell are you to tell me how to live my life   You think I sell my body  I merely sell my time  I ain t no Cinderella I ain t waiting for no prince  To save me in fact until just now I was doin  just fine  And on and on         Liiiissaaaa had put down a few when she met this girl name Lou  who convinced her to come home with her   she said  my name s Louise and will u take your clothes off please I wanna take you to the moon and back so get on your back   Sry I LOVED that song in high school One of the only few songs I have fully memorized and sing when I m alone   I m not disabled really I m more  I guess you could say  severely impaired  but it s complicated as I m sure you re situation is too   I m happy you found your way to get by I know first hand how difficult it can be trying to get a decent groove going with life when you have this mental and physical obstacle to overcome like disability or chronic pain   Also with being a sex worker imo that will be something that will become more and more legit and valid like it should be in due time It will hopefully stop being a grey market sort of job and more of a regulated  freelance contractor  type of job with some more oversight for safety   I know someone very close to me who works in the sex industry and it s just not what most people assume It s done with respect and dignity and it s done very safe   If she doesn t get treated like a princess she quickly will move onto the other 100 000 guys who gladly will     x200B   What do you mean by  I work mostly with devotees  I don t really understand what you mean with that statement   If you don t mind this question   do you have any feeling lower than T 7 Do you suffer any pain I ask because I had a major surgery to my low back when I was young and it has caused constant problems in my life It s a special kind of pain imo at least sciatic pain nerve pain is    Glad to hear you re doing well     peace Nice Live your life how you want  You are beautiful Nice tattoos as well   removed  Sex is like my number one interest after SCI now lol And I m glad you embraced yours  A lot of people think that people with disabilities are not interested in sex or desirable anymore and that s bullshit I m still the same horny fucker I was b4 my injury   Guess it s time to start my male wheelchair escort service       Thanks so much   It is somebody with a wheelchair fetish or a kink

once you realize what works well for you and your partner the sex can be quite amazing I wish you two the best of luck   Hahha escort on wheels    What a convenient service My husband got shot and has damage to his l1l2 vertebra and is having neuropathic pain Does anyone have advice on long term nerve pain care Does he have a physiatrist  He should  They should be creating a pain management plan for him  I ve been an L1 T12 para for 15 years and still have chronic neuropathic pain  There are meds that help  Some of it is also tone spasticity  Meds can take the edge off but it is rare that it ever fully goes away  Often it gets worse over time unfortunately  Neurontin Gabapentin are common places to start  Elavil is another   For lots of people anti depressants like that help too  Sometimes the depressive effects of chronic pain make it far harder to cope with over time    A muscle relaxer like baclofen is another common helper for tone related pain  often mistaken for  neuro  pain by newer injuries   A physiatrist is the doctor best equipped to help with this IMO  My non medical professional advice would be to have him start taking a magnesium supplement Also get a magnesium oil spray if he has any  surface level  pain   twitches or spasms along the skin hypersensitivity and or cramps It s not a miracle but it s the closest I ve found and magnesium has made a bigger difference to my life than any other drug or supplement since my injury   This should definitely be combined with any pain control that is prescribed by a doctor  it doesn t replace gabapentin etc But everyone in my SCI group takes some form of magnesium and we all agree that it s a life changer post injury  I literally have the same injury but t12 vertebrae  I take gabapentin and Lyrica but use cbd cream as well on my back which helps immensely  As a person who has suffered with nerve pain for 25 years I would say the two critical factors are getting a solid neurologist and a pain management doctor  The neuro can run a EMG  NCV to validate and  map  out the nerves that are causing you issues Depending where the damage is they can look at shots and things like radio frequency lesioning You are limited on shots   they are steroids and cause long term issues to the surrounding tissue Gabapentin   Elavil and a few other drugs can help The neuro try to go to a teaching hospital You need a top notch one the test needs to be performed by someone who really is good cause it can affect the outcome of the test After the baseline consulting   a few round of shots you can look into spinal cord stimulators Do your own research I had the trial of one and chose against it but they have helped many people   He can also benefit from a psychiatrist Hear me out I am not calling him nuts Fighting pain 24x7 for the rest of your life takes something out of you it does Having someone help you to get a good  head game  to help fight the battle does help I wish your husband well I wish you well too This will be a challenge to the family Please understand when your husband lashes out Being in constant pain makes people irritable and diminishes their coping skills ask me how I know   I do not want to be the bearer of bad news just a realist Nerve pain from spinal cord injury rarely goes away You learn to adapt and overcome but it will be a companion with your husband forever Please see a good neuro and from there a good pain doctor and then a shrink  I wish him reduced pain days ahead  Update  I read further in the thread and realized that this is still very  acute  It will take a while for the trauma of the injury and subsequent surgery to calm down I still stand by the comments but I would wait until post surgery and recovery before perusing the EMG   NCV Let the body recover first to see what extent you still have the nerve pain I would also say that PT will be critical Push thru the pain and make sure he  flosses  the nerves in his spine so they do not attach to the scar tissue from surgery  The only suggestion I have is to consult a doctor about Gabapentin I had severe nerve pain in the beginning of my injury  now 8 9months post  and Gabapentin helped me out tremendously but I no longer take it as I ve weened off the med Long term nerve pain may come and go and that really depends on the extent of the injury Right now your husband is in spinal shock and once the swelling goes down then the nerve pain may subside  Thanks so much for your reply This is all so new for us  The shooting only happened Wednesday afternoon and hasnt yet has a surgery to fuse his spine  they were still stabilizing him after 2 surgeries just to keep him alive  The biggest thing hes worried about right now is this pain lasting long term Also have same injury t12 due to Gsw gabapentin works real good only problem is it takes away a lot of feeling that you want I lost some feet movement and sensation when they put me on 900 of it too soon  It works thoI became quadriplegic during a blackout on LSD Here s what happened and the start of the craziest story ever one that goes back billions of years  Nice to meet you    Amazing that our health care system allows us to wallow in a mental health crisis without intervention I hope that changes for you soon That nursing facility should take action but I m guessing they only take action if you allow them to  please let them help   Whoa I have started to explain why this isn t a mental health problem and will more in the future I totally understand wanting to disregard Me but you only will if you don t do your research and ask questions as needed accordingly I m telling a story as old as time one word at a time Bladder issues   should I be concerned Sounds like neurogenic bladder You need to find a doctor who is in practice and will Listen to your concerns Understand your body will change overtime and unfortunately you ve had a sci which means a lot can change which will need to be seen by a doctor to ensure your health doesn t deteriorate   If you were able to void on your own before and now you re having troubles then this is of concern What country are you in I would find a urologist with knowledge in sci and have them do a urinalysis and a cystoscopy   I m a decade out as well and if I were you I would go see a doctor  Yeah I am still able to void but a very weak stream and it feels like I have not emptied Every night I would wake multiple times with the sensation that I needed to go That has been raised with my DR s for a couple of years but now it s different Sensation is affected I cannot tell if I am going at times I also had really bad urgency as well as other  accidents  can occur that I am in my late 50 s so I know people will bring up prostate Its been check physically and blood test and it fine   Neurogenic bladder totally matches thanks digging deeper I have had a history of kidney stones so I have chocked up a lot of this to those procedures but it s different now   Thanks for taking the time to reply appreciated 4 weeks post surgery and my dad can wiggle his toes a little bit  Baby steps  All good news Literally baby steps  That s a great sign  What kinda surgery  July 25 he suddenly lost all feeling below his chest due to compression in the spinal column from arthritis stenosis bone spurs The surgeon went in through the throat to chisel out bone growths and put in a plate to hold the column open Two days after they went in the back and chiseled out more growth in the C1 C7 vertebrae We think he has a bad bruise slightly lower in the spinal cord that will heal with time and maybe give him more movement For a guy that had no feeling or function 3 weeks ago a little toe wiggle is giving us a little hope Why am I now starting to have bladder accidents UTI is most likely Also the longer you have a neurogenic bladder the more likely you will need oxybutin to decrease your bladder pressure Sounds like a UTI or other infection Try cathing more frequently   6 hours is a pretty long time My urologist recommended every 3 4 so you could try every 4 hours for a time to see if that helps  alongside getting checked for an infection   Sounds like it s a UTI if you re a woman it could also be a yeast infection or bacterial infection  I m in exact same situation  Recently my capacity went down from 400 500ml to 300ml I also get positional leaking wheneverI vent down even with half empty bladder So annoying C6 C7 about 2 5 years post injury Im thinking it s time to see a urologist   I usually cath every six hours but lately I ve been pushing it    This is could 100  be your problem  assuming no UTI   I m realizing salt  sodium  has this effect on me Makes for a miserable day 6hrs is a long time   This after my accident I didn t have any bladder issues for months but after a while i got a series of really bad utis and now I have to do botox and oxybutanin to maintain continence Religion   DisabilityHey there   I am actually a quadriplegic and a pastor So I am a Christian but I believe religion is a personal thing and I think you need to take time and seek these things out for yourself regardless of what your parents think Unfortunately religion like politics can be super divisive but it shouldn t be we should all be able to have differing viewpoints and still respect and care for each other  I know it s easier said than done though   I know where you are coming from tho I ve had people tell me in a church once that my injury was a result of a generational curse Nonsense but people are entitled to their opinions even if they are stupid opinions lMy advice is just show respect to your parents and their differing views and continue to seek truth  I grew up in a conservative islamic family I still believe in god as a higher power I believe in an after life and I recognize the value and role of religion in society However I prefer to interpret it in my own way I smoke cannabis for medical reasons  pain  and my dad really didn t like that I didn t see him for 5 years at one point We got through it though through the power of love and acceptance and   just kidding we only got through it by pretending it never happened and never speaking of it again Still that s progress I tells ya So yah religion and disability don t always fit together so easily  I m Muslim T4 for a year Personally Islam really helped me get through this Most likely because of the basic philosophy in Islam which is that this life is considered a very quick test with several obstacles And if you pass you get to experience the afterlife where your house will be the size of planets you get anything you want and you ll live for trillions of years without dying no matter how happy we think we ll be in the after life it won t be close    If you face a large obstacle like a disability you re reward will be massively greater And if we knew how much the reward for being patient for having something like a disability we d want to go through this forever to get as much reward as possible   I don t know if this helps at all I really hope you find what works for you Feel free to contact me if you need any info or support  My mother is a wiccan she believes a lot of things about my disability that I disagree with   and I haven t found any particular way to solve it as of yet Atm I just treat her with respect and understand that we disagree  thanks this is a good solutionFour years with an L4 fractureYou don t have a spinal cord injury you have a spine injury Big difference  I had fractures in L5 and C5 But fractures heal what doesnt really heal is herniation that comes after it  try massages and therapy swimming but no running and lifting Can aggravate really bad and u will need surgery best of luck Also i would add that some chiropracters can worsen your pain  If u had compression fracture it means u fell on your butt right And u could stand up and continue playing  Wait just read your message again so u had MRI done Did it say u have herniation in L5 If yes then that s what causing your pain  If a disc herniates and leaks some of its inner material though the disc can aggravate nerve pinching it and triggering back pain and possibly pain and nerve symptoms down the leg  Yea thats huge differenceHe wouldnt be able to walkIt s been 4 years I don t think the fracture will ever heal correctlyThe spinal fracture I have never healed correctly and is rubbing against my sciatic nerve sending pain into my legs I m not sure what is causing my back pain but it definitely has something to do with inflammation and maybe even some disc issues I don t know if I have a herniated disc5 years out from injury  What have I learned The most important thing I learned is to just live your life Go volunteer go look for a job go play in the park just LIVE and you will be personally fulfilled AND as a bonus you will attract people who will share your vibe and want to share your space The best friends and experiences I ve ever had were by meeting people randomly Also That s how I met my current girlfriend I was just doing my job and participating at a convention and then I saw her and put some of my arabian stallion magic on her I also have 2 exes I met randomly  at a charity kitchen and at school So yah live your life  RT300 or other electrical stimulation bike for C5Hello First of all being a year out from such a massive life change is indescribable to someone who hasn t lived it I m sorry you and yours have been enduring this   I have an RT300 at home but only by the extreme luck of there having been one donated to a local nonprofit that helps low income people with disabilities obtain necessary medical equipment Furthermore the company  Restorative Technologies  wanted  3k to just activate it for me after I received it as a donation No matter how many times I explained that  3k is more than I live on in 3 months they didn t care So with the help of my therapists I worked out how to literally hack into the bike to use it Because RT refused to be helpful   Long story shorter   RT is currently top of the line but there are competitors now thankfully Check out https   myolyn com   same concept half the price   Also if you have private insurance talk to your husband s therapists doctors about having a  letter of medical necessity  written Private insurers do sometimes cover some or all of these devices  If he has active movement you can look into a MotoMed This does not have electrodes to provide muscle stimulation but will automatically switch into passive movement if the user isn t generating enough force for active movement It s will give you   about how much your left vs right is doing and can be used either as a leg bike or arm bike It s a good exercise device albeit different than the RT300  I ve had a similar model for 10 or so years Worked great until recently when the arm pedal colum snapped Asked for a repair but they seemed unwilling to fix an older model Can t remember the price but I think it was pretty steep so make sure he s willing to use it And one more tip if he uses it alot make sure to keep an eye on pressure areas after use    I like the Quell Unit  Yea the MyoCycle is just as good if not better and half the cost Thank you let me know MyoCycle It sounds a good choice  I see it has two types  MyoCycle and MyoCycle Pro What are the major difference For home usage is MyoCycle good enough  For C5 and sitting in a power chair is it applicable to use MyoCycle Thank you for telling MotoMed  It is good to know this product for future reference  He can move his legs little bit but has no ability to move pedal yet  pedal colum snapped     Thanks for the info and tip I will pay attention on his pressure areas if we got one at home peeing after sciIt sounds like you re pretty similar to me I m 4 years out and can walk unassisted and can feel when I need to pee but I never got the ability to just  open up the valve  like before the injury However I can pee if I m pushing like I m taking a dump It does cause more strain which leads to hemorrhoids and I m also pooping when I m doing this so no urinals for me anymore   I can mostly empty my bladder doing this but I still cath in the morning and at night to make sure I m getting a full empty to avoid a UTI But throughout the day I m able to get by without it  FWIW  I believe it was inside of 3 months post injury where I was able to both feel the sensation of needing to pee and actually being able to pee without a cath I was pumped full of flomax and that seemed to do the trick Now nearly 5 years post injury I still pee unassisted  I m a similar injury and I can only get out between 50 200 ml but it s a strain so I also cath to clear the bladder I m not walking on my own yet  3 5 years  but can use a walker Like you I m glad for my progress on sometimes miss the old days Good luck  I m C 7 Walking Quad I walk unassisted but still deal with the issues that come along with SCI like bladder I feel the normal sensation of having to go and if I have to piss like a Race Horse I can go on my own but still need to cath to fully empty   I know for me a doc told me while I may see some improvement on being able to hold the urge and not leak but the percentage being able to go like I did prior is small 9 years later I don t even think about it I pretty much muscle memory to me at this point   Also to when you say you miss what you don t have sometimes I ve been there and for me it didn t do much good mentally I ll just say look at what you don t have as  it is what it is  and focus on improving what you do  What is your current bladder capacity  Can you press your bladder with your hands instead of straining Hemorrhoids are no good Press on your bladder rather than straining did you already had some movement in your bladder when you took flomax because my doctor said that i need to have some movement in my bladder to improve it with meds before it wouldn t make sense thanks wish you good luck too and keep going that s true most of the days i can do it pretty well just some days especially when i m in the city every place remembers me about something i did there before my accident but the feeling doesn t stay for long i always find motivation too and am grateful for what i have and can also enjoy the things i do i feel the need to cath between 350 500 ml i always thought that my bladder capacity is smaller than when i walked but the urologist told me 2 days go that it s still normal like my by bladder before i never lost water even when i had 1l in my bladder it stayed shut hope this helps youTwo years ago today I broke my neck leaving me a C6 quadriplegic Since then I m back on my feet opened my own restaurant and try to live the best life to my ability My wife made this video showing year two post accident Hope this inspires someone to never give up Note from my wife   I decided to go on a run that Sunday We had just gotten new shoes for me the day before I went with the doggies and remember stopping and taking a picture of the  Anita street  sign because it reminded me of a dear friend in New York so it made me smile It was sunny not too hot or cold  just  the perfect day   I had taken your keys which annoyed you so much because you needed them to unlock the bike and go on your daily ride You rode the bike came home and we packed the car for our usual weekend beach day  Do we get food for the dogs now or after    Just got a text from Rachel to go to her pool Should we go there instead    We need to go grocery shopping for the week We will do that after the beach but we need to make sure we get there by 4 The store closes then on Sundays   can you take a pic of me    Fine I ll go in the water with you this time  All those decisions we made on Stupid Sunday are saved in my  won t be able to forget file   That s often what one remembers during what you deem as a pivotal moment in your life In that split second neither of us will forget  your life my life our bond and our already immense love for one another changed and grew I remember in the midst of all the chaos telling myself  oh wow  I really love him I knew this but the universe just confirmed it with this invisible pull towards saving him at all costs Now and always I can t lose him    Year 2 brought us less tears more walking more cooking less hospital visits a lot of hard work driving independence more laying out solo farmer market trips and  a new restaurant  You can do it all mon cherie I hope and pray to the stars that all our dreams in this life come true Nothing makes me happier than your kind and sweet smile  Man I remember your first video must ve watched it 10 times Just hit the 1 year mark for my own injury and can somewhat walk again Gotta make my video now   Thank you for this  Really appreciate this  Thx for the inspiration This is awesome So inspirational     x200B   I m 5 days away from my 5 year injury date Posts like this are what really make me smile  Love seeing this C7 Walking Quad took me 9 years but it was worth the wait     Keep it up  I m seven years post and most people can t even tell I was ever hurt  You ARE an inspiration   So glad you re doing well  C4 5 Walking Incomplete Quad 13 years post Loved the vid Life and love doesn t stop no matter where you are on your journey or recovery   I m currently pursuing my dream of living out of a suitcase for 2 years and my post injury journey started with my restaurant 13 years ago You ve just brought back so many good memories I hate being in front of the camera but you ve inspired me to give it a shot at the very least Keep living hard and I m looking forward to future vids       so good to see this  i have a dog as well and can t walk good enough at the moment to walk with him so this inspires me a lot and i will keep going until i can walk as well hopefully like you with your dog soon 9 months past injury  L1 T12 incomplete  can walk with crutches small distances so i will keep it up  Congratulations on your successful recovery   My son has a complete T12 SCI from a fall Was your SCI complete or incomplete Looking for some hope and encouragement that walking is possible after a complete SCI  Would love to see it Thanks Amazing That s amazing It for sure looks better than it feels every step I take is terrifying but trying my best to make it work Good luck Good luck would love to read your progress Found this newer video about Sex after SCI Awesome thanks for the info Thanks Great holistic approach  this was a great video I wish it was presented better though with succicnt info and graphics I d like to see this kind of thing that s easily digestable for people with SCI s and EVERYONE ELSE too That s how we educate the public   as for criticism  there was a lot of filler in that video   why talk about religion and culture and other shit when it comes to sex after SCI Sure all that is important but I imagine when someone is post SCI and curious how to have sex again they re not concerned about learning about the cultural norms first lol I also feel personally attacked that she said we ought to refrain from illicit substances What if I m tryna get laid while in a k hole  I think the only reason she said that is it can have an affect on your ability to achieve orgasm ejaculation She talks about meds doing that as well   People s religion can have a profound impact on how comfortable they are with sex to start with Like she s telling you to masturbate but some people s religion tells them that s wrong  Which is fucking stupid IMO Maybe that s why I m a freak lol   But yeah I ve yet to see the perfect video regarding SCI But most I ve seen have been more towards the mindfulness side And you don t have to orgasm to enjoy sex etc   at least she s trying to help you find a way to do that I need help organizing  beautify my room Do you guys keep your gaming  work computers near your hospital bed like me At night i need everything near me including my cloths need advice on dealing with 6ft ruleI m t 5 6 At our level  lung capacity is significantly compromised Covid 19 targets lung function I highly recommend you find a way to keep socially isolating and distancing unless you want to risk potentially a severe adverse reaction to the virus and possible death  I m early 30s T6 para I have my chair balanced so I can easily do a wheelie I would be concerned though if I was tipping over just from interacting with people That sounds stressful and unsafe  My back comes up to just below my shoulder blades and I feel steady but still dynamic when I want to be   Depending on what country you are in  not USA  I could see letting people in a bit closer outdoors with masks on but honestly its best to follow protocols for safety until a vaccine comes out When I get a cold I m not very good at coughing so I worry about getting COVID when many other people my age are not  Hey T6 T7 33 y o here   Balance has always been tough so I like the higher backed chairs I rent from my mom so I m not always alone but have hated being cloistered away from people   Do people around you not wear masks  Hi there OT here You mentioned you work Do you talk or hang out with any of your coworkers Also if you want to just talk just to chat with somome feel free to message me  35y old M T5 complete para  Covid Sucks I feel ya balance wise But next time you get a new wheelchair talk to them about ergo seating and other options to maybe help with some of that    But as a upper thoracic para we gotta be careful I honestly was a social butterfly before this going to bars concerts etc   and now I pretty much go to the grocery store and that s it till this Covid shit gets better I feel ya tho it s killing me too  But there are plenty of people like  gets_bored_easily out there that offer to talk  There are plenty of places like this too I recommend checking this out https   www carecure net has all kinds of forums to browse and talk  And if your single create a tinder account or something you would be surprised How many people will reach out on stuff such as that    I Just noticed like 4 of us really close in age with about the same injury we should start a group chat lol PT here I was gonna say your chair sounds a little too tippy Where the wheel meets the chair might be a little too far forward Could be worth looking into getting an adjustment I noticed the same  I new I wasn t the only one like this  I would like to talk to you guys  not loose contact       I live in the US where are ya ll at SCI due to arthritis stenosis bone spurs   any help I m not a doctor but I have been living with a SCI for the past 14 years My injury T12 incomplete  All I can tell you is everyone is different and heals differently Even from the same exact injury and same exact level etc it can effect people completely different   It takes a long time to know what ability you will have afterwards up to a couple years even  Is it a good sign he is starting to feel things below his level of injury It could be But it also could just be that limited feeling he felt at that point   Obviously it s important  especially right after injury  to work on trying to strengthen and get things as good as possible like his grip It sounds like he has an incomplete injury do you know what he has Complete meaning total severing of the spinal cord and incomplete meaning the cord is intact but damaged to whatever degree   Incomplete injuries can sometimes heal to the point of some messages still reaching below the level of injury like what you mentioned about slight feeling in his legs   I wish I could tell you more like I said I m only telling you what I know from my own personal experience I can also tell you that I live a fell life despite being in a wheelchair I m fully independent and happy which with hard work is totally a possible outcome for your father Who knows how much he will heal Time will tell Good luck to your father and to you He s a lucky man to have such a good support system and family around him  It is impossible to predict the course of recovery for anyone   all injuries bodies healing processes etc are different and so really this will all be anecdotal    And here s the anecdote I know  I was in rehab with an older gentleman who stepped out of his truck twisted his ankle fell and lost all sensation below his collarbone  He had cervical and thoracic incomplete injuries caused by stenosis and bone spurs  When I left rehab he was working on learning to feed himself   he had arm movement but no finger grip  Two years later we were at the outpatient center at the same time  While he never regained fine motor in his hands and his  previously dominant  right arm was much weaker he was walking and had what he described as  near enough normal  bowel and bladder function  He was living independently and working for his previous employer    I don t know where you are or what rehab he is in but I can tell you that the expertise and intensity of care you receive in a good vs adequate acute rehab makes a pretty substantial difference in long term outcomes  This sounds a lot like what I went through although I m about 15 years younger Instead of being in my neck my issues were in my lower back and they came on over time I d push through most days until one day I couldn t It hurt so bad I was in tears and I could barely walk I was diagnosed with congenital spinal stenosis and arthritis that was causing a disc to press on my spinal cord   I had surgery to clean up the calcium buildup and I ended up with nerve damage Either from waiting so long or from the procedure I was paralyzed from the waist down It took a good couple months before I got any movement back and nearly six before I could walk again My legs are still numb and I have issues with sensations I ve had all sorts of crazy experiences Touch one leg and feel it in the other Muscle twitches Most of this has sorted itself out luckily Now it s weakness and numbness That first surgery was seven years ago and they told me the window for nerves repairing themselves is about two years   I ve learned that I m an exception and not the rule by the way I just underwent my second surgery this past June Kyphosis My spine above where I had my original surgery started collapsing in on itself Luckily this time things went much smoother I had a much better doctor too The best advice I can pass along is to be patient and do as much as they ask in rehab but don t be afraid to let them know if something hurts Even when I couldn t do what was asked of me I tried As long as it didn t hurt I d go until my therapist told me to stop Even if that meant just laying on the table trying to move my legs when they wouldn t   Lastly I ve learned that if I can get through all this anyone can I tell people I needed a lesson on humility and patients Don t rush things and they ll without Maybe not the way you d like them to but life finds a way  Both Craig and Shepherd hospitals have significant online resources in terms of information handouts etc  The nurse advice line at Craig can be very helpful    It often takes a highly variable period of time based on the person to figure out if an injury is complete or not   you ll hear people talk about motor complete sensory incomplete or different levels on different sides   and many people  including me  make gains and experience changes for much longer than the six months window they give you in acute rehab    Get as much acute rehab time for him as you can   It s probably worth asking an OT or PT about starting estim now to prevent disuse atrophy  It s much easier to restart using muscle that hasn t wasted completely away  Thanks for your comment We haven t actually been told if the injury is complete vs incomplete When the doctors did an exam test in his rectum they said they could feel my dad bearing down The fact that he also has some feelings of touch in his legs makes me believe it s an incomplete injury He had no sensation to touch 2 weeks ago but then he started feeling a little bit I don t think the spinal cord was severed More compressed pinched and potentially bruised My mom or I haven t seen any MRIs or scans personally   Your last comment is really hopeful to me It doesn t pain me to think about him being in a wheelchair in the future I am just more concerned about him accepting the situation and being happy and finding joy It will probably take some time but I just can t wait to see him laughing and smiling like he once did Thanks for your reply Stories like this give me hope but as you mentioned I fully know each situation is extremely unique And like the gentleman you mentioned my dad s usually dominate right hand is not doing as well as his left Go figure   He is at a Spinal Cord Injury rehab part of the hospital in Milwaukee Shirley Ryan in Chicago is within 90 minutes of us and I wanted to request additional consultations of therapy there depending on how things continue to progress Thanks for sharing your story I was warned against seeking stories like this that would give me false hope I do understand that every SCI is unique and no two individuals heal the same It s amazing that you add able to walk again   We are keep him at therapy for longer than suggested because he is making good progress Insurance will cover 60 days but they basically said he should be home after 3 weeks We are going to keep pushing   Your last paragraph stuck with me I do truly believe that this challenge was given to my dad and our family for a reason We don t know that reason right now but all we can do is trust the process and stay hopeful Do you label yourself  Disabled I am factually physically disabled I don t like the label Nor do I like  handicapped  or  person with a disability  When people ask me what they should call me I say  I prefer  handsome     To me disabled and personal with a disability are synonyms I consider myself disabled Calling myself disabled doesn t bother me the slightest To me it s like just another label or description like race or religion  I consider myself disabled due mostly to  the social model of disablity  https   www scope org uk about us social model of disability   which posits I m a person with an impairment who is then   disabled   by society  expectations archetypes physical barriers etc  To quote some disability studies scholar I can t remember Simi Linton   to be disabled is an active process   I wouldn t say I  label myself  as disabled its more that no matter what I call myself society will still see me as different othered etc so all the negative aspects of the word  disabled  apply regardless However using the word  disabled  to bring attention to actual barriers   like stairs or lack of ramps   is useful to me as it reminds that me and my impairment aren t the issue the factors that make me disabled are the structures around me   I don t carry my disability  person with a disability  and I m not inherently incapable  handicapped    I m a disabled person disabled in the same way that I would be a wet person due to dealing with the effect of rain i e due to the barriers put in place by society   The social model isn t all that it doesn t explain disabling symptoms of impairment like chronic pain but my current understanding has led me to describe myself as a disabled person  I am whatever you say I am Disabled would be one of them Husband father son brother friend boss coworker asshole artist punk human amongst others Depends on the day and person I m cool with any of them  Yes I am disabled I d love to be healthy but I m not I have zero problems being called one it s a word that describes my condition and my daily struggles  I use disabled and I use it as an act of resistance The dream is for  disabled  to be a neutral term You mentioned in another comment that you don t like disabled because it makes you feel  less than  I understand that but I d put this back on you  why do you feel that way Because society has told you that disabled   less than   I call myself disabled because people are desperate to tell me that I have  overcome  my disability with my accomplishments post Injury That s a crock Half my body doesn t work I still use a wheelchair I can be young healthy successful contributing and STILL be disabled   Have a google of  internalized ableism  and look up  whenIcallmyselfdisabled on Instagram You may find it interesting  I would hope that if a friend relative colleague was asked to describe me  disabled  wasn t among the first 10 terms   I certainly don t label myself as disabled If I really had to describe it I say  I use a wheelchair   The last thing I care about is  labeling  Definitely consider myself disabled because I am no longer able to do 80  of the things that I use to do The things that I would say defined me  I call myself a cripp  Webster s dictionary says   Disabled   put out of action Handicap   a circumstance making  progress difficult   Who exactly decided that  handicap  was politically incorrect and  disabled  was ok  I have never understood that  23 years disabled  yes I am disabled 13 years post unassisted walking C4 5 Incomplete Quad I m perfectly fine wth the term Being labeled or calling myself disabled is just an identifier but not an identity Because I m upright I have to often explain that I m disabled to get assistance but I ve never looked at it as a negative connotation  T2 T3 I m a gimp  I consider my self a care bear in a cool chair  I don t use disabled because it could be many things On my tinder profile and other social media I ll say I m in use a wheelchair Because I feel really that s my only obstacle  But I feel that some of society puts a negative tone on  disabled  in many aspects  I do and don t I m still me internally I just am slightly different now physically Literally I m disabled but I don t try to wear that label on myself because my spirit is still  me  If that makes sense One observation I ve noticed is people often conflate being disabled with being ill I d like to say  tooting my own horn  that I m a healthy para  7 months post  and don t want people to view my as sick ill because I use a chair now  I do come under the definition but I never use the word Always say wheelchair user It s far more clear that way  I am disabled and I was born that way The nature and degree of my physical impairment won t change if I call it by another name If I would insist on being called something else that would 100  further alienate people from me who can t relate to my situation by giving them further instructions how to conduct themselves around me I m all for mitigating existing barriers not erecting new ones   I never use the term disabled to describe myself I just say I m a wheelchair user or I have a spinal cord injury The D word just makes me feel quite uncomfy tbh and I certainly do not wear it as a badge of honour like some seem to  If I had to choose though I d take it over the H word any day  Initially I did not as I was still able to work Over time scar tissue in my spinal cord filled with fluid and formed a type of cyst called a syrinx It is painful AF and causes additional limitations I had to stop working when I had to start using morphine 24 7 I was a pharmacist and voluntarily gave up my license at that point Coming to terms with being disabled was hard and took a long time but I m now comfortable with that I do still have episodes where I m not happy with not being able to contribute to society Especially recently with the Covid 19 pandemic as I can t be at a hospital helping out  My man   Gotcha And why Gotcha Thank you for your view   I guess I m speaking more for the psychological aspect of the term and how it could hinder ones outlook on life because labeling your self as such could mentally make you view your self in the same negative light society labels the term   To me being viewed as  Disabled  create a sense of being less than I m a person first who happens to suffer from a disability So I view myself as a  person with a disability   For example when I started being involved in adaptive sports I would constantly hear   How can you play this or that Aren t you disabled  and while I was never offended think about the discouraging mental toll it can have on a person who will possibly view themselves in the same light society does because of the misinformed use of the term Gotcha I can completely understand When I said  less than  I was speaking of my point of view on the term Not how I personally feel about myself The confidence i have in myself is why I have the current perspective of the term  disabled  Im no different post injury than  me  pre injury so why label myself with that term Yes physically I m disabled but the label aspect of the term plays a important role mentally   I can only speak for myself and personal experiences that plays into my way of thinkingTo me the psychological part of being labeled as  disabled  creates more harm than good Understandable   This is to create conversation on the termWould you be able do 80  of the things you used to do adaptive I took a Developmental Disability Course while in college for Human Services and it takes a deep dive on how persons with disabilities where and are viewed and it s definitely a eye opener to how negatively viewed   Look at the simple fact that ADA had to be created just so we can get a tiny bit of equality I sometimes use handicapped when disabled might lead to confusion like when talking about my van I dont want people to think there s something wrong with my van    I ve heard the origin of the word handicapped comes from beggars though like cap in hand asking for change Some bristle at that association You don t think your identity is what you define yourself as Yes by definition we all physically are Mentally the term can be harmful in how one views themselves I understand your perspective Thanks for sharing   In my opinion how we identify ourselves can be different than how we physically are by definition   Two things can be true   My disability doesn t create barriers in life it s a moment in my life that changed me physically but I m still who I am pre and post   The moment in life where I did identify as  disabled  it sub consciously created barriers   It wasn t until I looked deeper into the psychological aspect of the term and my own self acceptance and awareness of myself that I changed my perspective on the term when it comes to my identity   I can only speak for myself and my own perspective and how I came to my own way of thinkingDo you think you coming to terms with your injury is the same as accepting yourself as you are Ripple mattress Bubble or tubular DnD making some wheeled minis These are great That Barbarian Dwarf is definitely getting a new home Appreciate the link    These are great  I ordered them and the detail is fantastic  Yay  I m glad to hear and happy you enjoyed them as much as I did   Side note your flair made me laugh I feel ya Complete af here too How the hell do people afford outpatient rehab There are lots of grants available that help cover the costs Lots of us also start Go Fund Me campaigns etc  It s a lot of work but there s nothing else The medical system is a complete failure for us  My insurance covers 20 yr and last year I had over 90 visits  Depending on your hospital network they can offer financial assistance I was able to get an  under insured  discount which cut costs of PT in half I also applied for financial assistance which cut that cost in half again So I ended up being charge a little over  100 per visit instead of  450 per visit Still a crap ton of money but I m on a payment plan for it I m going to be paying it for years after I stop therapy but at least it s manageable   If your outpatient clinic has a social worker try talking to them That s how I figured out the discounts I ended up with I wish you and your brother the best of luck  Hey there Curious on the timeline of your brother s injury My dad had a SCI 3 weeks ago and will likely be home in 2 weeks We live between Milwaukee and Chicago and Shirley Ryan looked really appealing for additional therapy down the road  Take a look at Neuroworx in SLC  They are excellent  Also a nonprofit founded by a fellow with an SCI and his PT  They have a truly phenomenal group of therapists and are really excellent at working with insurance companies to get things taken care of  They are very engaged in the adaptive sports community as well  That s what we re working on right now He had a gofundme when he first got injured a year ago so he doesn t want to go that route if he can avoid it It blows my mind that this is so inaccessible Thanks so much I m definitely going to have him look into this His injury was a year ago last week He has already done inpatient in Schenectady a couple months after his accident and has been doing PT at home as much as he can since then He got accepted to Shirley Ryan on Friday Any good exercises for stronger hips  glutes Monster walks and laying clamshells  Get a stretch band That depends so much on your degree of injury and possible range of motion I can kneel on all fours so I can perform knee pushups and can use an ab wheel the latter does train those two areas  I m using this website Even though it has exercises for the knees it also has things for the glutes as well as quads and hamstrings I don t know what your level of injury is but you may be able to do some depending on your level of control  strengthening exercises   https   www knee pain explained com knee strengthening exercises html  Bridges   be sure you re tucking your pelvis in  How many of you use a wheelchair at home but walk while outside the house What impact does this have on travel plans And if you travel how many assistive walking rolling devices do you pack I do the opposite Wheelchair for longer errands like grocery trips and other things where I anticipate I ll need to be standing as well as full days out If I don t know if everything will be wheelchair friendly I bring my mobility assistance dog who helps me navigate that terrain Crutches at home for short errands and for visiting friend s houses  I know I ll have a place to sit I won t have to move around too much  When I fly I bring my chair my crutches and usually my dog  Sometimes he gets a vacation if it s international travel or if I ll be going places that aren t super compatible with handling him   even though he s allowed public access everywhere sometimes the tradeoff isn t worth it  I break down my crutches and bring them with my carryon  My Sidestix can break down in the middle and fit in a backpack or duffel   I also have the opposite situation  I can use crutches and AFOs in the house for short periods of walking standing but I use my manual chair for out in the wild  I always travel with my chair but bring my foldable forearm crutches which fit nicely on the back of my chair  If I travel for a sporting event I also am pushing my sport chair as well   I would say travel with whatever you will feel comfortable using  Botox Injections for Urinary RetentionI ve had it twice now and it works very well for me I ve now had the procedure done twice The first time it helped but not a whole lot   A week after my second procedure It worked very well No leaks whatsoever It s been about 4 months since the second one and it is starting to wear off a bit but still working very well   Right now I m having them spaced out 6 months apart The first time I got 100cc injection second was 200cc My urologist says the dose can go up to 300cc and be spaced out a lot shorter due how long it lasts in the individual   If you are someone who can cath themselves and have leaks I highly recommend it  I started using a newish drug that is working well for me Myrbetriq no leaks in 4 months  Botox is the best thing I ve ever done I get 200 units every 6 months I used to struggle bad with not being able to go more than a few hours without cathing Now I can go 12 18 Absolutely changed my life  I ve had it done twice now and it works very well for me I didn t know there was such a thing as a  low dose   Had it done two months ago for the first time Started losing it s potency last week Going to get a bigger dose done around October  A urologist can inject  Botox  https   skinworksmed com face botox cosmetic treatments   into your bladder to treat urge incontinence or overactive bladder This helps the muscles relax which will give you more time to get to the bathroom when you feel the need to urinate The injections are done in the clinic and most patients tolerate the injections well What exactly does it accomplish Fantastic answer cheers Yeah I ve been taking that since my injury That along with bladder injections works extremely well myrebetriq worked way better for me than ditropan although i still prefer the botox cheers for the info Up to 18 hours without cathing I m so confused  bruh i don t thnk you re supposed to go 12 18 hours without urinating You either don t drink enough water or I don t know wtf else what if you got too much botox and now your bladder likes to hold the pee and won t let it go MY PRECIOUSAcute Rehab Experience1 What were the questions going through your mind when finding out about your injury    Something like  Fuck fuck fuck fuck  So I ll never walk again Maybe this is all a bad dream  Shit       2 What were the initial challenges  physical emotional functional etc  going through rehab and what did your therapist do to help you stay motivated Or what did you wish they could have done to better help you    Initial challenges included coming to grips with my injury  That lasted for the entire time I was in therapy I was able to push it aside some days but I was a dick to some of my family and friends because of it  sitting upright wiping my ass dealing with my sex drive  28 y o male  and finding relief from the nerve pain associated with being in a bed or chair all day  Therapy staff was AWESOME Super encouraging gave me space when I needed space talked to me like a person and not anything else They laughed with me and cried with me We would wheel down to the hospital coffee shop for coffee and to get some fresh air Again my therapy staff was awesome     3 For individuals with injuries above T6 what were your initial thoughts about AD and how could we better explain AD in the beginning of rehab    Don t believe I had any issues here    4 What were resources that helped you And what were resources of information that could have helped you sooner    The SCI support team at the hospital was great Unfortunately I was too mad at myself in denial to malke the best use of them Now any time I am back at the hospital for a check up I make sure to stop up and say hi and offer to talk to any of the patients      5 What helped build better rapport with your therapist    My therapists all seemed to know how to push me and just how hard to push and when to let me relax a bit They all talked to me like a person and not with all the big medical terms They seemed less like a  therapist  and more like a friend that knew a lot of very specific shit relating to my current condition     6 What was the most important thing you learned from rehab    That you ll never improve if you don t believe in yourself and that every small step is one closer to the finish line     7 Other than your therapist did you have a mentor    What did you learn from them The nurses and other staff on the floor were the absolute best I still keep in touch with a few of them to this day  nearly 5 years later           Other Q s     How has COVID affected your daily routine     I just wear a mask when meeting with customers at work        Any advice for me as a student on communication and overall patient care       Don t be too rigid and up tight in your professionalism You ll be dealing with people many of who are coming to the realization that they ll never climb a mountain or go skiing or take their dog for a run again I m not saying to be unprofessional but more so to be vulnerable and speak candidly It can really make all the difference         x200B     x200B   Good luck in your career and if you ever have any questions you feel I might be able to answer please pm me  I ll preface by clarifying that I don t have an SCI I do though have experience of being along with my OH the sounding board and advocate for my adolescent daughter who is a complete T9  injured at 10yo now nearly 14  As a result of that journey my OH has been invited as a guest speaker a couple of times for a seminar symposium for PT and OT students at our local university primarily on the subject of using para sport in rehab  so hopefully our combined thoughts may resonate a bit especially for any pediatric rehab you may be involved in  1 What were the questions going through your mind when finding out about your injury    initially she was too much scared confused to think much beyond  what happened Why don t my legs work   and so on There was a lot of the classic grief progression  why can t it just all go back to normal Why me us   and then for us as parents a lot of practical questions   dealing with insurance companies lawyers home renovation specialists etc By the time daughter got out of ICU and moving towards rehab some of those early questions were a bit more settled With encouragement from her superb medical and therapy team most of rehab was focused on  how can I do this  rather than  why can t I do that   Make that your focus as far as you can  2 What were the initial challenges  physical emotional functional etc  going through rehab and what did your therapist do to help you stay motivated Or what did you wish they could have done to better help you    Early physical challenges were the basics  sitting up maintaining seated balance transferring bed to chair chair to floor into and out of a vehicle etc Bowel and bladder function and learning to self cath  as a pubescent girl  my OH was completely brilliant about that as I wasn t much help as a dad     bowel stuff was a different story though as abdominal trauma had led to bowel resection and an ileostomy so stoma management was rolled into everything else  PT OT and SLP all worked really well together with surgican and medical teams to coordinate all this From a PT perspective again the focus on  how to do X  and keeping everything mostly positive  plenty of cheesy humour plenty of empathy and emotional support  was a big help Tracking achievable milestones such as being passed  safe  to hold a wheelie and get rid of the anti tippers or beating last week s time on a stationary handbike or whatever all helped to keep motivation high But the flipside was also important  acknowledging that everything was really a bit shit and not even slightly fair but you can still do this even when you don t feel like it   3 For individuals with injuries above T6 what were your initial thoughts about AD and how could we better explain AD in the beginning of rehab  4 What were resources that helped you And what were resources of information that could have helped you sooner    We re in Ontario the SCI Association of Ontario sent in a peer mentor  in her mid 30s had been injured as a teenager went on to play para sport at a national level get married have kids    who was completely awesome The inpatient rehab centre  Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital  has a whole library on site full of both consumer appropriate and more academically focused literature and a full staff of psychological and social worker support for patients  and importantly for their families  All of that was invaluable Access to adaptive sports ADL resources and play equipment was key too   it was helpful for our daughter to be reminded that despite all the hospital crap she s still a kid and can still play basketball or bake a cake or tear around a playground with her friends  5 What helped build better rapport with your therapist    Again from the perspective of a parent we were most impressed that our daughter s PT was easily able to switch gears from explaining things in kid friendly terms then addressing us  but never ever talking across our daughter or speaking about her in the third person while she was listening  as parents to go into a little more depth She realized early on that our needs were best met by understanding the  why  as well as the  what  and was happy to take the time to explain her process Her ability to find motivation to work hard even when our daughter just wanted to curl up in a ball played an enormous part in a successful inpatient rehab stay  6 What was the most important thing you learned from rehab    Another one where I probably have a different perspective as a parent of a child with an SCI For me the one key learning is to know how and when to offer help and when to acknowledge that although daughter might take longer to do something it s really really important for her that she does it herself until she decides to ask for assistance That might be something as mundane as putting a sock on an uncooperative foot or getting the jug of OJ from the back of the fridge   or it might be helping her into her hockey sledge or basketball chair or talking to the transportation agents about her need for an aisle chair to get on and off a plane  7 Other than your therapist did you have a mentor What did you learn from them    OMG yes So many different people It  helped   I suppose that daughter s accident made the local news so people were like  oh you re   that   kid    but from the first visit from our SCIAO mentor while still in ICU to the sledge hockey club to a local resident who has lived with an acquired SCI for 40  years and invited us to check out the modifications to his house everybody we have met along the way has added to our store of knowledge and resources If you get the opportunity to encourage your patients to seek advice from those who ve been in their situation before do so Even if the conversation is as mundane as  where do you keep your catheters when you re out with friends    people who ve faced the situation in person may have a different perspective to the  official  answers from medical folks      Other Q s     How has COVID affected your daily routine    Any advice for me as a student on communication and overall patient care    One more personal plea from me as a parent caregiver  involve the family or the home care team in your conversations whenever possible They re the ones who will be doing  often quite literally   the heavy lifting once the pt is discharged from inpatient rehab so they need to know the what how why where and be prepared for their journey     Good luck with your acute rehab rotation  Following as I am an OT who just started on the SCI team I really benefited from the peer mentors at the hospital If your rehab program doesn t have a peer mentoring group it should get one Many of them would stop by after work every so often with a variety of ages genders races and educational backgrounds so that many patients found someone they could relate to in one way or another  Hi u PabroPicasso   Wow Thank you so so much for your responses I m glad to hear your experience through your rehab has been positive and so supportive I love the fact you offer help in seeing the patients whenever you re at the hospital You re practically a mentor in that regard   Your quote    That you ll never improve if you don t believe in yourself and that every small step is one closer to the finish line     resonates to me I ll keep your words in mind during times I am faced with an unknown or novel situations and during my reflections with my instructor Thank you also for your advice as well about professionalism and opening up vulnerability and honesty with patients     I ll definitely reach out to you when I have more questions Hi u oakvillein   Oh wow Thank you so much for answering my questions She sounds amazing You must be very proud of your daughter overcoming many obstacles and accomplishing so much from then to now Like her mentor she can be an inspiration to others as well  D  The  mundane  things though are thoughts that would solely come to mind when you encounter that particular situation I didn t even think about home modifications or even the catheters I am really glad you gave me the perspective of pediatrics with SCI because that didn t even come to mind until you responded so thank you so much   Also great advice about family and home care team involvement That is definitely an area we did not get to practice in school as much and I know during my rotations I will be have many opportunities to work on my communication and teaching skills with my patients and their family Congratulations I hope we both learn from our responders on this thread   Hi u WildNW0nderful   Thank you for the tip I m sure my rotation has one because the whole facility specializes in rehab and I will check in with them     If you don t mind me asking what were things you benefited or learned from your peer mentors Did you get to choose who you wanted to be mentored by Sex Life Post Injury   Where to begin Hey man I just want to say that in my personal experience there are A LOT of women out there who won t care about you being in a wheelchair I met my now ex wife after my injury and have found a lot of success dating since the divorce a few years ago using a combo of dating apps and going to bars clubs to meet new people As for the other stuff you may want to look into a viagra prescription Not being able to orgasm sucks but over time you may find that the ability comes back   hard to say Hope this helps  I have some anecdotes some advice and whatnot My advanced apologies for the length   I m a 35 F T12 complete Married prior to SCI accident divorced 4 years after it Am now in a LTR with my  abled bodied  boyfriend and we re just shy of 2 years  we met on Match com    To answer your first question I find honesty is the best policy  After my very bitter divorce and the obligatory healing period afterwards I was ready to date but had grown to detest drama and the usual bullshit that typically comes with dating  So on my profiles I made sure there were pictures of me in the chair I talked about it but I also tried to make sure that people knew it didn t define me  Not unlike able bodied dating women love confidence And I found out men do too When you re not in your 20s you just don t have the desire to fake it anymore So people love you for who you are or they can gtfo  I know it s corny but the chair is kind of an asshole filter  You are correct in that there are very few dating apps targeted for disabled dating And those that supposedly are tend to bring on the devotee crowd Which after dating a few self proclaimed devs it was rather fun But not fulfilling Anyway in general I would recommend using the more well known sites and paying for a subscription Usually people that pay are more serious about finding a partner As mentioned I met my boyfriend on match com But eHarmony was also a pretty good success for me If money is a factor I also had success on plenty of fish but a lot more weeds to deal with on that one   Anyway to answer your second question I feel it s important to tell you that one of the men I dated prior to my current guy was actually a C6 C7 complete quad  Sure I suppose I was a little more open minded being in a chair myself But he was definitely far less independent than I  Penetrative sex for us was super rare  I would climb on top and motion my body with my arms It was exhausting lol  There was a lot of foreplay a lot of touching and I could have kissed him forever We both just had to alter our expectations Sex wasn t going to be what it used to be for either of us So we found other ways to feel sexy feel good and just have fun Ultimately especially with a spinal cord injury the best sex organ is between your ears  brain   Use that to your full advantage I can imagine a relationship without penetration because that one mostly was  And in case you re wondering it ended because he ultimately couldn t allow himself to be loved and sabotaged our relationship  And honestly he was one of my favorite lovers I ve ever had We just had such great emotional connection that I felt satisfied and fulfilled every time    All of that to say is it easy to find someone willing to see you and not your chair No It absolutely isn t But let s be fair dating even able bodied sucks It s just a process that you have to go through and initiation before you can find that special someone My boyfriend isn t a saint for dating me because I m awesome   But he is an honest to goodness good person because he took the time to get to know me  You will find a lady that isn t shallow that trips your trigger that makes you happy Treat her with equality and fairness Manage your expectations of able bodied life and your current one Be open and honest Have confidence in yourself and it can happen   Hit me up if you have more questions If you want to talk Any of it I m super open and happy to share knowledge  C7 incomplete here most definitely understand what you going through mentally right now I ve been through those motions others in this forum probably has as well at some point in their journey What changed for me and I can only speak for myself is accepting who I am and loving ME first and understanding I am still ME The process of getting to that level of clarity of self acceptance and love is painful emotional and long  took me 9 years  but in the end it s worth it You end of finding your self and becoming self aware learning new things about yourself and regaining that same pre injury confidence of not more along the way   Most importantly you have to remove expectations and just live your best life Be present and enjoy time It brings a level of freedom and gratitude thats hard to explain until you experience it Like I said previously it s a process a truly painful emotional one but worth it in the end if you can overcome it   This all comes full circle to relationships and dating No human being can fill the void of love that your missing within yourself A person can provide a level of love you ve never experienced but until you love you first you will always battle with  am I good enough  which is unhealthy to any relationship because you can t hide it It will show  Once you reach the level of  I am more than good enough  the universe will take care of the rest   Last thing it s not about someone accepting your new body When a human truly loves you for who you are this  new body  is invisible When someone loves you for you they don t care about size shape or package It s about sharing moments and enjoying life alongside this person  Yeah man I was 28 when I had my injury too I was very fortunate in a lot of aspects and what you ve written sounds a lot like my thoughts at the time Since my injury I have found the most wonderful woman who loves me for me and not who I once was She is the greatest There were some hurdles initially but we managed to get over them I first had to level with myself and then from day 1 was very open and up front with her about everything   Feel free to pm me and we can talk in more depth   https   www hotoctopuss com diverse accessible sex additional needs   https   www hotoctopuss com diverse accessible sex additional needs   A lot of people have covered the relationship parts so I m just gonna focus on the physical Between ED meds which range from viagra to tri mix just talk to your urologist personally I use a low dose tri mix injection and BAM At least a 2 hour hard on lol   Ejaculation gets tricky on the other hand I m a t5 para complete so no feeling   I use a tens unit to ejaculate But there are many options It seems like from what I ve read vibrators tend to work easier on incomplete injuries than complete But they to have an extensive range From a hitachi wand and the hot octopuss vibrator to medical grade ones like the vibrect and ferticare   But somewhere in there you should find a way to ejaculate Personally I ve tried every vibrator except the ferticare and none worked If you try the hot octopuss personally I d just put the money towards a ferticare cuz I have one and it s just a 170  paper weight lol  At least the ladies like my hitachi lol  So it just takes time trying things out Carecure forums has a whole thread about it https   www carecure net forum sci community forums relationships sexuality 128849 electro nut busting page38 post2899516 you do need to make a profile to view the relationship sexuality part My boyfriend is 32 years post injury c5 6 complete We met as friends two years ago as my friend started working for him   she ended up being shitty which brought us closer together but that s another story  and we ve been together a year and a half  I fancied the pants off him from the first time I met him and after a few drinks would get a bit flirty One night there was a few of us out in a club we were talking but it was quite loud he leaned over to say something and put his hand in the middle of my back for balance I told him it was nice then went to tell my friend that I d help him to bed and it went from there   Mostly the only time we can have proper penetrative sex is in the morning while he s on the bed straight after his catheter unfortunately at that point I m usually too tired or in pain if I ve not taken painkillers yet Later on in the day sometimes we have the opportunity for it in his chair  with difficulty as I m not flexible  or we just do other things  We have plenty of toys and are often trying out new things or different ways While penetrative sex would be a nice thing to have with him it s not something I miss and that side of our relationship is very fulfilling   He has no sensation at all but takes Viagra he has some herbal ones and he also uses a penis pump and has a ferticare vibrator Using all of these helps him he able to apply remove his conveen himself and helps with his spasms aside from sex stuff He has not been able to achieve proper ejaculation   If there was anything at all that I could change it would be that he gets something out of sex It does upset me that he can t but not a pity or sad kind of way   As for dating if I was to use an app or website now I wouldn t care of someone used a wheelchair or walking aid or anything If they had no pictures showing it I would hope they would mention it before meeting up so we can decide if a place is suitable to go to or not  Sorry for being late but your post intrigued me   1  There are women out there who would want to date and have sex with you even with your injury I wouldn t mind dating someone with a SCI for example Sorry I can t give you any resources to help find any girls but I wanted to let you know it s not a lost cause   2  This is something I only learned about more recently and am still completely new to it but have you heard of tantric sex From my limited understanding it is a slow form of sex with the aim of building a deeper emotional and spiritual connection with your partner that is supposed to lead to longer and more pleasurable orgasms even if intercourse doesn t happen The good people at r tantricsex can help you if you re interested   About telling a woman about your issues do you mean in general as a quadriplegic or specifically sex related You should hold off on the sex stuff unless it is understood at the beginning that you two just want to bang If you want a long term relationship talk about yourself like hobbies interests etc before diving into sex Unless you are planning to date online for a while instead of meeting online then in person within a week you d be jumping the gun to talk about sex before a physical date If you mean general issues too much info at once may overwhelm her Take it slow get to know each other as people and answer any questions she has when she asks or you need to explain something   Good luck out there  Hey thanks for the reply   Honestly just hearing that makes me feel a little more optimistic I appreciate the words I did see a urologist who recommended waiting until my first sexual experience post injury to see if things change in the heat of the moment Then follow up things up with medication  So we ll see Hey there No need to apologize for length i appreciate the thoroughness of your reply  Honesty does sound like the best policy That s funny you call it the  asshole filter    I like that It s very true though you want someone who can see past the chair and past your deficiencies However i feel like a lot of the dating apps encourage that 2 millisecond decision making which usually relies on the more shallow pretentious thought processes That further tightens the pool of potentials But  I guess that further reinforces your point to invest in a monetary based platform where people are more committed to finding a lasting relationship Interesting   Its very interesting to get your perspective as a SCI ind who has had relationships from both sides of the ability spectrum It s certainly inspiring to hear you have had success in both I look forward to using more of my brain    All in all you are right You just have to manage your expectations and thought processes I caught myself recently thinking how im so paranoid about my disability that im walking on eggshells and not being myself Hopefully by just being honest from the get go and being up front  via wheelchair in picture or description  will remove some of the pressure of relaying that information in the first place so i can focus on being me and having fun Hey thank for reaching out I know myself and anyone reading this who is in a similar situation appreciates it Nice to know you ve been in a similar frame of mind at one point in your life and have succeeded in transitioning into a happy relationship post injury or try a hitachi magic wand Support and general questionsYou re right I hate those questions about walking again It makes the conversation so awkward For me The most depressing time was after rehab at home when people stop coming around Luckily I had two good friends  I was hurt in high school C6  that would take me out   deleted  I m a C4 C5 myself and can t use my hands I had my accident as a teen in high school For me the hardest part about being a quadriplegic is being left out There s so much I don t get to do that I once did but there s still a lot I can do I graduated college twice got married traveled all over and taught wild 6th graders so almost anything is possible Relationships are important as well I have no friends right now  hang out and chill with friends  but that s mostly on me My wife is my best friend Psychology it s with you in some form or fashion forever but it doesn t stop you from living life  Understood I can definitely see the loneliness when time marches on and life just has to continue This guy has kids though and they will of course want to see him every day Has to be a great source of comfort I m suspecting family will be a life saver Divorce I worry about  Understood about the calories Hadn t thought about the decrease in caloric need but it makes total sense of course  Thanks Looking for ways to improve spO2Spinergy wheels What axles do I need I have just ordered myself a TiLite chair fairly sure they use the standard axle pins at 110mm What exactly makes you think they are too long Most axle pins have a little nut that shortens or extends a small amount as required  There was a bit of play with the lx wheel on the axle I have I m estimating it was a quarter inch which is the interval the axle sizes come in but I don t have a great way of measuring that   I d like both wheel sets to be usable and I don t think I ll be able to make that adjustment myself so I want to get a second set of axles anyway How Have Drs Not Found An SCI In My Spine Pain alone is not an indicator of an SCI Loss of neurological function  both motor and sensor function  would be   Not a doctor   maybe the problem is in the nerve roots  nerves leaving the spinal cord but they are not considered part of it  or farther down in the peripheral nervous system   https   en wikipedia org wiki Radiculopathy  Oh if you have this pain in your face it is most likely not related to anything in your spinal cord as the face is innervated by the trigeminal nerve a cranial nerve   https   en wikipedia org wiki Trigeminal_nerve   Just for the sake of completeness  Did they take an MRI of your brain Did they check for demyelination i e sensory evoked potentials examination       If I have Lyme then why does my pain only get worse positionally   Not a doctor   maybe because in certain positions the body exerts pressure on the Lyme damaged nerves   I ve personally seen two people get crippled by Lyme s disease  both very active outdoors and caught it from tick bites  It s nasty stuff      I ve seen over 40 drs including 5 neurosurgeons in the last 6 years but they won t operate They don t think anything they do will ease the pain   Poking around people s central nervous systems with surgical tools without a plan or at least a reason is not good medicine I agree  Hey man Thanks for sharing I too have asked that for as long as I ve been injured What keeps me going is that the next big breakthrough in painmanagement or even a better SCI treatment could show up just like penicillin in the petridishes in the window  Nothing is granted and even though I m not where d like to be I try to make where I am the next stepping stone  Feel free to write me anytime Hey man I havea C5 spinalcord injury happened while I was skiing in 2018  I have some degree of neuropain but mainly it s the paralysis for me Although we have different complications I still think the whole SCI community can relate to each other    You story sounds exactly like chronic Lyme My mom has very similar symptoms What treatment did you get and how soon did you get it after you were bitten by a tick  Hey Tonic Water what kind of injury do you have Do you experience similar feelings in your body as I do I would like to pick your brain as this can feel like one of the loneliest disorders Sorry to bitch just venting   Sorry to hear brother  or sister     What is your paralyzation and pain like Is it all over body pain Do you feel pain in parts that are paralyzed I have so much to learn   Thanks for writing me Sending positive vibrations your way   I bet if you got a nerve biopsy it would be clean My mom has horrible burning pain all over her skin She had a nerve biopsy done and it was normal no damage just horrible peripheral neuropathy This is kinda my own theory but I m sticking to it adaptation over time Crazy part about Lyme disease is it likes to hide in places with low blood flow it s a microaerophile Part of my thoughts is that old remnants of parasite  dirversity of parasites that come with ticks microbiome  get lodged into capillaries and can t get broken down Borellia takes advantage of the dead parasite and survives insides it  Kinda a fringe theory but google it  I only truly believe this because I have taken a drop of my mothers peripheral blood finger tip  and stuck it under a microscope slide I saw dead chucks of what looked to be microfilarie Low blood flow means limited access to oxygen antibiotics etc over time these bacteria grow and form biofilms Where do you have capillaries in the body Everywhere Thousands and thousands of miles of capillaries in our bodies but some are better oxygenated than others Suggestions like aerobic exercise or sweating heat may help to increase blood flow which drives the O2 content up in the capillaries I e helps create an environment in which Lyme cannot survive Japanese knotweed  resveratrol   other natural compounds  is believed to help Lyme by increasing and enhancing blood flow Johns Hopkins has done a lot of studies in mice and culture looking at the presence of different varients of borellia Some bacteria grow fast  log phase  and are treated by conventional antibiotics Unfortunately some grow slow  persisters  and are not killed by the standard of care  and then we develop chronic Lyme   My mom has had problems with increasing severity over the past 4 or so years I ve been googling ever since she got sick As for a little bit of my background I m a 4th year phd student at UF studying medical sciences My research is in neuroscience not Lyme but my mother Illness has pushed me to spend hours and hours and hours thinking and researching about it  Also look into otezla my mom said it helped  some  of her pain  Also with opioids and anti anxiety meds on board your body could be slightly hypoxic Opioids plus other drugs equals respiratory depression maybe not when your awake but likely during sleep I urge you to try to remain active By laying in bed your muscles begin to waste away One of my friends has mentioned that bed ridden patients can use electrical stimulators to  exercise  If you have no tolerance to exercise maybe you could get one of those Sorry I am replying so late You go to UF I am a UF engineering alumn Such a small world   I like your theory of how Lyme is in our capillaries Let me ask do you know if Lyme can cause CSF leaks My neurologist thinks I have one due to my positional headaches and various symptoms and it matches my symptoms perfectly But it doesn t explain the pain I have in every single joint Lyme does however   I ve tried so many treatments for Lyme We tried IV rocephin for 6 months Minocycline doxycycline and about 4 other antibiotics Also have tried a concoction of the best Lyme herbs in high doses   every day for a year None of these treatments did anything and I ve just progressed   Do you reside in Gainesville FL Colonoscopy Yeah I had one Everyone is different it wasn t pleasant but it wasn t that difficult I can t walk but I can feel when I have to have a bowel movement Not that it matters too much because you have to drink that colon blow stuff so a bowel movement is imminent 20 30 minutes after drinking it It sucks for everyone SCI or not You literally spend all day on the toilet By the time you re done shitting your brains out it s almost time to go drink another glass of that stuff and do it all over again I had no accidents no mess Just a sore asshole and an automatic aversion whenever I reached for my next glass of that terrible drink  I ve had one they admitted me to the hospital for the previous 2 days and made me regularly drink some liquid that  uh  cleansed my bowels if you know what I mean while I only had liquid nutrition it was a pink something that tasted awful and didn t satiate When they put the probe up they ve still seen a lot of residual  stuff so it wasn t quite working but they could perform the colonoscopy Will depend on your country of residence if this is a viable option at all though  Pro tip when drinking satan s ball sweat  the drink they prescribe to you    refrigerate it and have a second drink near you Take a sip then then take a sip of a soda or juice to help you from gagging The colon juice is god awful tasting and can make you gag and vomit  Are there not alternative tests to the colonoscopy maybe not quite as effective but no cleansing required  Yup I ve had 2 colonoscopys Prep day is rough Extra soft toilet paper   butt wipes help I get nausea from drinking the solution   not being able to eat so lots of jello   chicken broth saved me I drank pedialight the second time   that helped so much  I did   T 12 L 1  stayed naked at home and did the dash  Dr told me I had a clean colon for whatever that is worth I had one but I am still able to walk It is a huge mess I also felt intense anxiety   I think because my blood sugar was so low I was begging my sister to take me home just before the colonoscopy while still running to the bathroom Take two Dulcolax the night before drinking the nasty stuff   I think it s called Go lightly   and have someone there with you to help you clean up If that isn t possible can you ask your doctor to stay in the hospital the night before or if there are some easier ways to do the prep The test is easy compared to the preparation  My husband had one done and it was an ordeal but do able  He can t walk so he definitely needed my help  We just had to be vigilant and stay on top of emptying the bag out so sleep the night before was non existent  It was actually easier on him in a way  before the skin on his butt would be horrible after all night on the toliet  Yep Has one Was a bit messy but that wasn t the worst of it 2 days after my stomach got real gassy and it turns out I got colonists with streams of bloody mess bursting out A quick trip to the ER and some antibiotics took care of it Scary  Not sure ER doc said they usually do a colonoscopy to find out but since I just had one they just pumped me full of antibiotics  Colonitis Bahaha I get it Oops  I just had to laugh at the  sore asshole  comment  I have to get these done every year so I totally get it  I call the prep  the night of a thousand waterfalls   You can t tell if you are pooping or peeing  I just give up and sit on the toilet with a book Yeah the DNA test As long as it s negative you can avoid having a colonoscopy They re pretty effective I think that depends on what you are having the colonoscopy for If it s for routine colon cancer screening the tens no easy way around it Bowel prep is so they can see every square inch of your colon with no poop interference in the way What do you mean by emptying the bag Does he have a stoma haha what kind of  colonists  did you get Fractured L1 Causing Cauda EquinaHad an l1 burst fracture last april i had no sensation in my feet and calf for months and slowly started coming back like everything else It is a waiting game you have to be very patient and also work as hard as you can 6 weeks is very early new studies shows that the spinal cord can regenerate for up to 6 years    Also it s different for everyone   I m walking kinda okay can run for a fee minutes have problems with my balance and in the last month just started to urinate without pushing my abs Was using catheter till january since then i have to push a bit or sometimes a lot  to be able to urinate  Meditation helps a lot i m practiseing qigong mostly  Hope it helped you could dm me if you want to   Good luck I had a t12 injury that at first left we fully paralyzed from the waist down I gained quad movement first and now a year in the only movement I dont have is my left ankle and calf Bowel movements stabilized as well It takes a long time to heal and you have to try and work the muscles Great therapy helped me and also AFOs to be able to walk with crutches  I have a t5 9 fusion  At time of injury I tripped and fell forward to palms and knees I lost feeling below the right knee Over the next 4 weeks slowly everything below my waist became numb and I struggled to move my legs  Surgery and 10 months of therapy later I can walk  I walk with a cane can t feel the soles of my feet take drugs to control the clonus in my legs oh yeah don t have sensation when I urinate or during sex Some days are better than others  BUT I m alive and so are you and this is not a death sentence  Yes nerves do what they want and hard work helps  Feel free to pm me  L1 incomplete burst fracture 3 5 years ago Took a few months to be able to move anything below the waist Quads came back quickest and sensation in the right leg got down to the ankle so muscles rejuvenated well in that leg Less feeling in the left leg not really anything below the knee However sometimes I can feel my feet or ties but it intermittent and doesn t stay long Still cathing but can push some urine out Bowel program has gotten better but still can t void completely I m using  toe offs  and can walk with a walker a bit Crutches are harder cause of balancing issues Using my wheelchair for long periods out still and until stamina increases It s a hard new normal and requires a lot of PT but it really is up to you  I have the same fracture My injury was 2 years ago I can walk but I have no sensation in my butt my left foot I can t move my left ankle and I have no bladder or bowel function Unfortunately it s just a waiting game I hope you heal and get better as your recovery goes on  HELP  PREGNANCY AMONG SUPER

had children so I can t give my own experience But you might find some of the groups on Facebook to be helpful   they re definitely more active than this sub The two I know of are more UK centric  I believe there are US equivalents but I m not familiar with them   If you think it might be helpful the two I m thinking of are SCI Owners  Group and SCI Powder Room  the latter is for women only    Good luck and sorry I can t be more help I m sure it s a lot to process so I hope your appointment goes well tomorrow  Sorry I have no experience with any of this but here is a link to the shepherd center in Atlanta  excellent sci place I can not recommend them enough  This is a specific section for women with sci and if has an area for pregnancy The people at shepherd really care and want to help so if you have questions they would be more than willing to help you   https   www myshepherdconnection org sci women I m c5 incomplete and use a wheelchair for long distances I am not petite  5 9  but am very thin due to my injury  I ve had 2 kids both at 38 weeks via c section My daughter was 7 lbs and 10oz and my son was 7lbs 12oz  My advice to you is find a high risk OBGYN that actually has experience with SCI  I was watched very closely by my doctor  that sounds like an old wives  tale my OB told us with newborns they tend to have a similar birth weight as their mother did though exceptions happen obviously for many reasons Thank you so much your reply gives me some confidence   I may take you up on your offer as I think of questions Some might be pretty personal may I have your permission to privately MSG you This is a good start thank you Thank you all for the references you all are amazing   The titles of these groups though    HA I ve actually stumbled on this website prior and it was indeed rather insightful Your input will have me contact further this is excellent    thank you I hope they can provide resources in my Southern California area 7 lbs is 3 18 kgMucus accidents after colostomyI ve had a colostomy for about five years For most of that time I didn t have any issues with mucus from the stump bowel However I have started to have increased spasms that seem to be caused by mucus plug buildup there which is cleared out by a fleet enema every few weeks still experimenting with the frequency I ve never had any discharge though if I don t have an enema it just stays there and must make my body uncomfortable   I suspect I have some internal haemorrhoids that are irritating things and causing the buildup considering how long I went without any problems Going to have some more investigation is done   I still think the colostomy was one of the best things I ve had done I don t miss bowel days at all  Having to change several times a day is a bummer I ve recently started to leak when I bend down to grab stuff from the floor Being c6 c7 it s a whole workout to transfer to bed change and transfer back on the wheelchair I m paranoid now checking if I ve been leaking all the time I know this is not helpful just wanted to share    This was helpful to me I may be facing some decisions about my GI function and management in the near future You ve alleviated some concerns If I need to ask more when the time comes I d post my own thread but thanks for your reply That s interesting  and unfortunate  that you only started to have some issues now Thanks for the help best of luck to you in figuring it out Any information is definitely helpful both good or bad Thanks for the information T3 ASIA A  Experience using electric wheelchair with stand up functionAnybody ever had stem cell ThanksI ve had a Schwann cell transplant They re very similar to stem cells If that s what you re asking   What did it achieve CheersDid it improve anything Keep leaking when bending down to grab stuff I have a high T injury but my experience is that I didn t leak positionally gained a bunch of weight started leaking positionally lost  not enough  weight and positional leaking stopped    I asked Urology about it when the leaking began and they said that often over time with complete injuries muscles weaken and positional leaking becomes more common so that s another consideration    Depending on where you are and what your sensation is like bladder Botox may be inpatient which can take a while to get authorized so you may want to open the conversation sooner than later  ThanksDropping weight with an SCI is so frustrating I ve dropped 20 in the last 4 months but hit a plateau I literally have 2 protein shakes  450cal  and one decent meal  700 1000cal  per day and it s barely coming off anymore Hitting weights and pushing a hard mile 5 days a week I fully regret my first miserable 3 years All I did was eat      How do you explain your injury to kids I always wanted to fuck with them and say  the monster under my bed got me  My dad convinced me not to though   I had an accident that broke my back Now my brain can t talk to my legs because there s a break in between  My niece 6 always asks why I can t walk I always tell her the truth about tree falling on my car because of the storm and breaking my back Best way to tell it as it is I think  My legs don t work properly like yours so sometimes I need to use a wheelchair crutches  I ve been teaching kindergarten through 2nd grade for 12 years Kids can handle it First day of school I tell the story of how I fell off a cliff Then when they ask about it later we go a little deeper I do tell them when what they are asking is private I won t explain catheters to a 6 year old so I ll just tell them it s too personal a question I like to keep bathroom stuff private No kid has been offended by that one yet  I just straight up tell them what happened using simple terms that are age appropriate Children are people too and I always try to treat them with dignity and respect as fellow humans on this planet What I would tell a 6 year old is different than what I would tell a 10 year old or a 15 year old or a 3 year old so it s hard to say specifically   I might tell a 3 year old that I got a boo boo on my back and it made my legs tired I d tell a 6 year old that I hurt my back and now my legs don t work right anymore I d tell a 10 year old that I have a spinal cord injury that affected my ability to move my legs I d tell a 15 year old the basics  that I would tell an adult  but I would keep it PG 13 and leave out any drama and keep it dispassionate  because airing out dirty laundry to a teen is inappropriate   Everyone else is giving good advice so I just wanted to share a funny story Neighborhood kids came up to my house while I was outside with my dog and were playing A young girl asked me why I was in a wheelchair and I said I broke my neck and can t walk She responded and said shouldn t you break your foot and not be able to walk It made me laugh and thought well yea a kid would be confused by my statement  thats an interesting question I don t know but  I ve replied to kids ranging from  I was born like this  to  I didn t listen to my mommy  lol     x200B   I always find it amusing how unfiltered kids are    OH MY GOD YOURE IN A WHEELCHAIR YOU CANT WALK   YOU CANT WALK   YOU CANT WALK UP STAIRS HOW DOES IT FEEL  It depends on how old they are really  Small kids I tell I got hurt and now my brain can t talk to my feet and then kind of work up add specifics from there    I am careful to always answer further questions  how do you pee if you can t walk to the potty   as clearly as possible   I don t want kids to be ashamed of having questions so as long as they re polite and I can figure out how to relay information in a way that seems age appropriate and also respectful then I do  That s a good one I tell them that I didn t eat my fruits and vegetables  Mine is very close to that Ask if they have heard of nerves or a spinal cord If not explain nerves re kind of like a wire that carries messages from my brain to my feet and my feet to my brain Then demonstrate moving my arms  or working body part  and say my brain can send the messages to my arms but the message can t get to my feet I used to compare it to cutting a phone cord but that doesn t work anymore   She responded and said shouldn t you break your foot and not be able to walk   Both would do it but the foot heals eventually the neck does not L4 S5 here Female obviously Originally posted to dying sub Question is below   Usually lower level injuries lead to a flaccid  or atonic sometimes called non reflex  bladder That means you re unlikely to leak unless your bladder is literally overfilling  unlike a reflex bladder where involuntary spasms can cause leakage  So you could try increasing the frequency of your cathing  every 3 4 hours for example  for a period of time and if you re still getting discharge on your underwear that would suggest it s vaginal discharge rather than urine If it s whitish and thicker than water that s another good indication that it s vaginal discharge and not urine  The sniff test should help Urine is pretty distinct  Every Single Time that I see my urologist I get this same lecture about kidney damage being the leading cause of death for people with spinal cord injuries and that I   HAVE   to protect my kidneys Any time that you suspect that there is a problem go see your Doctor GP or Urologist  I m told to just show up at my Urologist office but YMMV  Kidney damage is cumulative and you may not qualify for a transplant due to pre existing conditions  So I am not sure if this will help or just confuse things further but I had a thoracic giant pseudomeningocele develop after a surgery and as it changed  grew and shrank  it had a lot of weird and mostly unpredicted effects including interfering pretty dramatically with bowel and bladder function which was something neurosurgery asked a kit very specifically  I have had surgery for syrinxes and the outcomes were far better than I had dared to hope  That s the thing I don t cath I m getting a new mri in 2 weeks but my condition is degenerative similar to Spina Bifida in a way I use the valsalva maneuver to urinate which was recommended to me by a urologist about 6 months ago now My sensation to urinate isn t always there so I do leak a little bit  a drop or two  when it overflows But my sensation is changing my symptoms are changing and now it s getting harder to urinate with the valsalva maneuver and I m just getting overwhelmed to be honest I was equally hoping someone would and would not reply with this comment I have done this one a couple of occasions but thought it was weird lolI m told I was probably born with this growing in me I had surgery last summer and my cyst came back to half it s pre surgery size in 5 months I m getting my year post op mri in 2 weeks I have a feeling it s at least back to full pre surgery size  if not bigger  by the time I get the new mri It was 12cm before surgery last summer Quads wearing a wedding band I m a C6 C7 quadriplegic that has been wearing one for 15 years of my married life Weight loss made me need to downsize so I went to silicone rings I might wear the titanium one for pictures but it falls off now so I m happy with the repeater silicone   In all that time including wearing it during Woodworking and other significantly risky activities I ve never had a threat or concern over wearing a ring You should be fine   The one thing I did consider when we were shopping for mine was whether a comfort fit might make a difference for reducing the risk of pressure areas I don t think it was a bad idea to choose that feature of the ring and I don t know if it cost a penny more just a matter of which one we chose   You should be good I hope the proposal goes fantastically and let us know how it went  You could look into a silicone ring if you really want to wear one My husband doesn t wear a ring  never has even before SCI except for some pictures    I personally like wearing a qalo brand silicone ring  We aren t married but been together 19 years We just got matching tattoos on our ring finger if that s something you re into  I guess I m confused as to why it would be unsafe I m a para not a quad so it might be something I m unfamiliar with  C5 C6 incomplete the small hand tingling I experience becomes an insatiable itch with a ring on decided to go the tattoo route  Thanks for your input Really appreciate it  I ll check those out  Thank you I have sleeves so that s definitely something I ve considered I m a quad and have worn one for 5 years I am also confused how it would be dangerous if its just a band   Can anyone enlighten us Nice I m fairly heavily tattooed so I ll consider that route 3  years post bowel situation has started changing  Have you started eating any thing you normally don t Are you consuming dairy I randomly became lactose intolerant after 4 years post injury You also could try not using suppositories digital stimulation works fine by itself for me Hay there 10years t10 complete on this corner of the world I am hoping this is useful for you Especially when we both are same level    From what you shared I seem to figure you are a person of regime I like it for I believe I am a man of regime  Not as strong or systematic as my friends or peers but regime nonetheless Morning first thing after brushing is the morning chores  adult suppository   digital stimulation Do it for at least 50 minutes or an hr and then be done with it I often try to do within the same time bracket in the morning Rarely I do cut myself some slack a skip a bowel day but those days I eat very less and mainly green veggies Do note I am a vegetarian  yeah by choice don t like eating animals  And I probably would have had bowel accidents 12 14 times mostly at home and at work 3 4 times After 9yrs of my injury in my 30s it took a while for me to realize if I have milk based items empty stomach after my morning chores as first meal I ll have a bowel accident This wasn t the case before like 2 3 yrs ago I figured body has changed aged and now I have to maintain it Which is why i started having milk based items after my first meal No problem after that   I also observed my bowel program is affected a lot by the weather also During winter it takes longer this again is my theory Might not apply to you at all   I personally haven t experienced this because I have stuck to a system  almost at the same time every day for at least an hour And with suppository Many people don t use it but I use it everyday cuz it gives the confidence I will not shit my pants unless I eat something that doesn t goes well with my stomach And till now it has only been the milk scenario in recent time that I know doesn t go well   I do keep transferring a lot and do push ups on my wheelchair  lift myself up pressing against the wheels  in the name of body movements Do household chores like doing the dishes sometimes cook sweep the house  I don t vacuum use a broom to sweep if that s what the say    If you want you could try a suppository   10mg a day and figure if it works better   Also if you crossed your 30s body is aging we need to account for somethings which we used to ignore before  Oh so it s not just me alone who became lactose intolerant randomly Nice to read But digi stimulation alone doesn t work for me I have to use suppository I can t say that I have started eating anything new we  partner and I  generally have stuck to the same diet for years And only a bit of dairy  a slice of cheese or yogurt on occasion  but it s generally never been an issue for me   that s wild lactose intolerance just cropped up for you like that I wonder if maybe I m seeing some similar kind of change too with that or something else    Interesting thought re  suppositories I ve had a tough time getting things going without them generally but  maybe it s time to try switching up the program Thanks for the feedback your experience   def can feel lonely dealing dealing with it   This is all incredibly useful Thank you for sharing all this dude   Degenerative Disk   SCI related I have a C5 injury with just rods in my neck for 11 years I ve been contorting the same way you describe along with forming a calcium mass near S1 due to long periods sitting and my S vertebrae fusing together and breaking My surgeon is willing to do screws and rods but like you ve already figured it ll just continue So we ve decided on steroid injections to help with pain until surgery is necessary  Feeling terrible after appointment with andrologistThe doctor should not have said that  I was injured at 18 I have zero sensation in my dick viagra doesn t do anything but make my face red I have no reflex erections and for years no psychogenic erections  But now I do have psychogenic erections  It changed  My partner and I figured it out together over the past twenty years  Sex is more pleasurable and I have more sexual function now than I did at 20 A big part of that is how much love and trust I have with my guy  He makes me feel way better than I can make myself feel and it wasn t always like that For years I thought I could only contribute with oral not so   I know how cheesy this sounds but your brain is the biggest sex organ and you might just be amazed like I was at how very very good sex can be with the right person doing the right things with to you If you believe you can t get anything out of sex it will be harder to find ways to make it work  Doctors can not tell you exactly how your body will function after injury especially in regard to sex They don t know everything   Your body and its  responses can change   Try other things and stay open to possibilities  Cialis tadalafil works for many who viagra doesn t  Explore realize it may just feel pointless sometimes but STAY OPEN to pleasure  The not feeling sex part sucks There s usually tons of options to sustain an erection from shots to wearables to different surgeries Try the different drugs before the surgeries   If you can t orgasm and ejaculate then ask your doctor about  electroejaculation   I have not done this but was told that it is an option when   if I meet someone and want kids That s odd an andrologist didn t explain this to you  Not injured but do SCI research in bladder bowel and sexual function   I would point you toward The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis for fertility information link at bottom Electroejaculation is a procedure that uses electrical prostate stimulation to cause an ejaculation typically for in vitro fertilization and not during intercourse   There are some high frequency high intensity vibrators that can help achieve ejaculation without the need for electroejaculation but again is usually for fertility and conception rather than during sex   As far as having children this group is having quite a bit of success but I am sure it is all very expensive  in vitro fertilization or artificial insemination can be quite pricey    In terms of the actual sexual component you are talking about there is some fMRI data showing that prostate stimulation in males can cause brain activity changes that resemble pleasurable sensations but I didn t see the published paper yet  grain of salt  Maybe that won t work for you because of your bowel issues not sure   As for just being a guy there are lots of ways to pleasure a partner besides penetrative sex An open and understanding conversation could lead to positive relationships that could be fulfilling   I wish you well   https   www themiamiproject org home research resources areas of research fertility  dude all I can say is you ll never know unless you try Also   since you had an injury prenatal your brain at that age is super plastic so sexual pleasure etc may have simply been rerouted from your penis to elsewhere Some people with SCI post injury report having orgasm like sensations from being touched in places other than their dick  you are going to need to explore a bit   I would also suggest going here as it is one of the most populated SCI forums on the net with nurses and people with tons of experience  https   www carecure net forum  Every injury is different and doctors always give worst case news Doctors don t know everything You re going to have to try and see what happens for you  That doctor is so way wrong and narrow minded There are plenty of ways tok pleasure yourself and your partner despite disability You just have find what works for each other and experimenting is the fun part any way  I think that s what the doctor mentioned to me as a test in a hospital but I really wouldn t want to use it in my daily life    Thanks thoughFirst time having sex after SCISounds like you are handling the issue in a thoughtful mature way I cannot speak so much to female orgasm but I do know there is a correlation in men between injury level and the ability to orgasm without electro therapy etc My understanding is that men T 6 and above can ejaculate I am T 5 6 and managed to father five children the old fashioned way although orgasm can be painful at times due to dysreflexia However there are therapies that can trigger ejaculation in men with lower injuries but they generally involve clinical application by fertility specialists But I have heard of men ejaculating  triggering orgasm simply from vibrator stimulation So you might try clitoral stimulation using a vibrator and see if that could work I wish you the best of luck with everything I have been injured for 30 years and can say there is life after SCI so hang in there  I was injured when I was 22 and I am 27 now and only recently with my current partner been able to cum It s obviously not even close to what it was before but it still feels good   I ve had partners before him but none of them turned me on like he did so I think that is a factor Maybe trying porn too you just have to be super horny I ve also had success with  squirting  which you may see it how you see it but turns out it is super hot to my partner so rub your gspot a lot or have him do it til you re gushing   I ve also found if I m really turned on I ll rub my clit like I used to and I can feel a build up and my heart racing like when I used to cum It s gonna take a lot of focus and practice also I feel like I regained more feeling over the years I m a t12 incomplete btw   Anyways I d love to talk more anytime and if you want you can message me here or on Instagram  lilboofs_tv First time after injury I ve  c6 c7 male  had sex I think it was2 months after my injury while in rehab at Sheppard center a day after switching to intermittent catheters  My sex drive was still really high with time it went down significantly Me and gf didnt have sex in maybe a year but that has nothing to do with injury it s probably time to break up Before they took the tube out at the hospital there was a chance I wouldnt have sexual function I kinda miss masturbation more than sex but that s just me crying about not having my right hand function   I do not have a complete injury and mine is at a lower level but my injury has really impacted my ability to feel much of anything below my hips My sexual function has taken a big hit from it although I am not completely unable to feel anything so ymmv   The neat thing is most folks born with  female  anatomy like us seem to unlike folks born with  male  anatomy have some nerve endings that run though the vagus nerve and bypass the spinal cord Nipple stimulation also seems to be wired up to the same portion of the brain that feels your regular type of sexual pleasure   I used to be one of those people that could orgasm quickly and even just from penetration and was very sensitive below the belt  and losing that was hard  But Pulling out all the stops so to speak  simultaneous nipple clitoral and internal stimulation   fingers will become much more integral than dick for your sex life  and really getting into things mentally means I can orgasm again  nowhere near as strongly or for as long as I used to but it s definitely an orgasm  if my partner takes their time and there s lots of foreplay and chemistry You might find that you can too  Not injured but do research on SCI There have been a number of studies on sexual stimulation and orgasm in women after injury   Komisaruk and his group at Rutgers have done a number of studies that may be of interest to you I am not sure of your comfort reading technical papers but they are mostly available for free online You can probably just read the introduction and discussion of the papers if you don t have expertise reading science papers Keep a dictionary page open and look up the words you don t know It gets easier once you lean the lingo Start with review papers as they usually give a pretty good overview that is less technical   These may not have an answer for you as every injury is different but it may help give you more understanding of what we know on the topic The scholar search below should help get you started Shoot me a message if you want   https   scholar google com scholar hl en as_sdt 0 2C5 q female spinal cord injury sex btnG  It took me a coupe of years and overcoming some mental road blocks of my own but I got back to having regular orgasms I  F  think it s mostly in your mind You have to find that new sensation that s associated with intimacy and then learn how to cultivate it Which actions increase it and re learn how to build arousal with your partner You still have all the connections  vagus nerve  that you need I wish they had told me that out of the hospital Good luck and have fun  I was injured 23 years ago in 1997 when I was 14 I was also born visually impaired on top of that fun stuff right My first time having sex post injury was my first time having sex at all I mean at the time I had a hand job and one time a girl licked it in the game of truth or dare    It was interesting to me how my brain adapted to the lack of sensation Even though the sensation wasn t really there my brain kind of filled in the gaps It s still like that to this day as long as I can see what s being done If it s in an area where my sensation is Limited or completely gone It s similar to the sensations I get when I try to move my hands I can attempt to give someone the middle finger I feel it move but it doesn t Unfortunately the girl who I lost my virginity to ended up being kinda crazy I that s the completely other story  My body is also adapted by being Ultra sensitive in certain areas where I can feel I most Like my neck and my ears can be super sensitive at times They definitely were not like that before I ve also found that things that vibrate are also fun I don t stick them in anywhere but topically there very nice Also do something guys can trying to get a chance Have your partner hum or moan with you in there mouth For me at least it gives a nice body sensation Especially if you know they re having fun I ve always been a giver personally Getting the person I with to orgasm definitely get me there   I ve seen quite a few injured newbies on the sub who are understandably depressed post injury I understand I was there for a bit But you need to try to look at what you can do now and move forward I m done kinds of things and met people I don t think I would have ever had the opportunities to do if I hadn t been injured I wouldn t want trade any of these experiences or people for much of anything   My regrets at the age I am now is mostly not doing more that I could have done Now that I m starting to have issues with atrophy back issues and the aches and pains of just getting older   Try to look past what you lost I m trying to see what you have gained or what you could gain Find something you love doing and find a way to do it  It s mostly all about perspective I m open for messages if anybody wants to chat   Forgive any typos I m trying to use voice recognition on my phone  As an C6 7  M  can only have orgasm by ear licking Some partners can t take it there but when it happens is really great  It s a tough thing   some women can some can t orgasm after injury but most I know are able with practice and exploration to find a different sort of climax A key for many women is exploring sensations around other areas   mouth nipples fingers etc Your partner sounds like a good person to try some experimenting with   what if you both try sex without penetration Once he realizes you are enjoying yourself too he could unlearn that expectation about needing to be able to give you an orgasm in the traditional way For what it s worth I helped create this sexual health resource for people with SCI maybe you ll find it helpful Www scisexualhealth ca There s also a good group on fb called women with SCI D you could join to ask other women   M  You can definitely Cum after SCI I ve have my problems and doubts about sexuality after SCI until finally had sex and don t feel the penetration made Cum my partner several times giving her orals When everything ended I decided to masturbate myself while she touches me kisses etc well I ended up cumming all over my sheets Had to wash it next day But yeah you can defenitly Cum just in the same way you do it before SCI it would take you some practice because the loss of sense but definitely you can cum  I can t say specifically what could help but my bf  c6 c7 incomplete  hasn t been able to orgasm in the 3 years we ve been together Today for the second time this week we ve had success and we realized all it boiled down to  so far  has been positioning We tried doggy style using a triangle pillow where he sits on his knees with the triangle pillow supporting his butt and it worked when we tried again it wasn t working till he spread his legs a little more and success We re thinking that spreading his legs even helped him keep it up   The first time his AD gave him a  wake up in the middle of night bc you had to pee for over 30 minutes  type of pounding headache for the hours following but this time he got AD for like half a second and then he came   Use your imagination fantasize and experiment  had we tried new things more often it probably would ve happened sooner  Im a 35y old male T5 going on 16 years post injury Spent the first 8 not knowing how to orgasm or ejaculate Researching and asking questions on forums like this is how I finally figured it out so your on the right track   I did come across this article recently https   medium com  enagoski how to orgasm with spinal cord injury d8a3ddcac3e0   As sex after SCI and sex with disability in general has become a fascination of mine lol The other thing is they make a female version of the ferticare vibrator now It s a super strong medical grade vibrator that you need a prescription for    https   medicalvibrator com product ferticare 2 0 female   No idea how well it works may be worth doing research first Me myself I use I Tens unit to orgasm ejaculate No idea if this works for women or not  I was injured at 21  female T11 complete  and am so amazed at how well you ve handled this first time back in the sack   In my experience my sensation down there can vary quite a bit day to day So maybe next time y all try you ll have more sensation or maybe even less I also describe my injury as it s like my lower half used to speak at full volume and since injury it can only whisper to my brain It s not totally mute but it did take me a while to learn how to listen to it better And if I am busy stressed distracted it s easy for me to miss the subtle cues my body gives me   With that in mind here are some things that have helped me and my now husband get across the finish line  1 Vibrator is good to kind of help you get that proprioception of where your vag is  2 Playing with his member in my hands or mouth gets me going while he simultaneously is doing the same for me  3 Weed increases my sensation alcohol decreases it 4 My pelvis likes to be fickle and what feels  amazing  one second suddenly feels like nothing the next so I communicate that and we change angle speed position etc  5 I help him help me Don t be afraid to use your hands and stimulate yourself It s also hot for him to see you enjoying yourself   Happy humping   M20  I ve been struggling with Suicide after my SCI at age of 17 the phrase that you said give me hope there s life after SCI so I just have to keep on the struggle until everything gets better Thanks manHey fellow Sheppard alum I don t have anything useful to add just wanted to say hi  You have to find that new sensation that s associated with intimacy and then learn how to cultivate it    that s a really amazing way to put it and something I m going to discuss with future patients Hahaha Excellent   I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked

you experience spasms when trying dmt I tried shrooms for the first time a couple weeks ago since my injury last year I only took half an eighth and I didn t experience an increase in spasms  Shrooms I sometimes get a bit more Acid I definitely do its like waves of every muscle firing I ve done DMT 50  times and never had any spasm issues  Yes LSD Shrooms DMT Ketamine MDMA gives me spasms every time hard fucking spasms it s kinda nice though in the beginning though I always know that when the spasms arrives the drugs effect is soon kicking in like within 5 minutes  p Shrooms lit my muscles up in my legs and abdomen like a Christmas tree and I didn t even take that much It was alarming so I stopped where I was at All I took was three capsules worth  nowadays I stick to weed which calms my spasms   did you try it report back Each injury is different the spasms take some time to appear and I have been 3 years since my accident and the spasms have evolved over time  look for spinal shock I think that s what it s called And whit Dmt the spasms last longer Or just at the time while tripping It depends on each injury it happens to me just like you my legs do not stop moving but at comedown they calm down and return to normal in a few hours  sadly I can t trip while in my chair I can only do it lying down due to spasms still fun though I F ckin trip balls last time on 200ug Haven t tried but I think it would provoke me spams just like any other psychedelics I ve tried Game ideas to play with a quadriplegic personCodenames is simple enough yet really fun Many board games use cards  properties in monopoly territory cards in Risk etc   which can be difficult for a quad to hold see or memorize I highly recommend purchasing something similar to  this Playing Card Holder  https   www amazon com gp product B000TYO1XO  It is large enough to accommodate an entire handful of cards and it s transparency allows for viewing even the lower part of the cards  I  C4 incomplete  love exploding kittens euchre chess She loves this game Great idea Thank you Relationships C3 completeI m c6 c7 and I know every injury is different Never though I m gonna look at someone s finger s pinch strrgnth and think man I wish I had that With c3 I can imagine what a warrior you should be to handle all challenges That s kinda how I look at my situation 2 and a half years in We wake up and go to war every day battling pain mental illness and list of 10000 other things we have to deal with I ve started relationships with my gf right after my accident and to be honest right now looking to break up I never though that people should begin relationships to be happy First we have to try to find things we enjoy by ourselves new hobbys like with c3 I d say audio books learning new topics that can sparkle your imagination cosmology neuroscience if you breath independently I highly recommend you learning more about breathing techniques Once you do all that and keep yourself on scedule and busy it might get a bit easier to deal with the situation Very important for us to look forward to doing things on scedule every day and I know being 3 levels lower injury I can t imagine how hard it is for you I ve seen people on YouTube with high level of injuries in relationships so that s possible but personally I think if it happens it happens if not you should sit down and think what can you do to have some enjoyment in life by yourself Remember with injury or not life is very short and as visitors on this planet we should try to expirience what we can what our physical body and mental state allows us Sometimes k listen to music and think to myself man it sgood I can still hear Btw 1 hour music session when you do nothing else but enjoy it is another thing you can still enjoy in sessions every evening  I don t wanna sound too optimistic or positive because I feel miserable several times a day and that s also ok it s just normal in our situation  I hate this guys who say oh my injury opened up this whole new things I can do now What a bunch of sick people who act like injury added something to their lifestyle I saw a guy on youtube who could literally get up walk around lift his own wheelchair talking about how he does wheelchair transfer in the bathroom Please don t watch all this maniacs and think they are happy with sci and I m miserable must be something is wrong with me So I guess just go with the flow try to keep yourself busy and don t wait for somebody to appear and love you you know you can love yourself and do things that are enjoyable by yourself If you meet someone who d choose to be with you that s great I know it s shitty cards we ve been delt with but what can we do that s part of the game I hope there s at least something positive in this rambling   I am a t10 complete and what I do know definitely will in no way correlate for you But I hope you get some takeaways from this   I too used to run behind relationship and hoped against hopes that someone would love me Someone did but I got horribly cheated upon and she made me penniless I barely got out of it and I got another wonderful woman in my life but I messed it up cuz I wasn t ready to accommodate time for her We broke up This period of lockdown taught me a lot how wrong I am that I only grew old but did not grow up And that I need to find happiness within to attract anyone with same thoughts process Where I am getting to is find happiness It s really a tough ask And it cannot be done day in and day out But that s why routine comes in and helps us Cuz with routines  schedule we can attach small wins which gives us small happiness And when we are happy from within we will also attract a partner for the person we are   The ex yes she troubles my thoughts at times I feel helpless too But it s something that I have recognized and now she gets lesser and lesser Mindspace Cuz I have a schedule where I don t have time to think astray thoughts And music is my go to therapy so I can relax   It s a thought that my ex fed into my head that I will not get anyone But I did and somehow I ended up sabotaging it So don t you worry you will get into a relationship and you will find someone Just make sure when you do you are happy from within And content with yourself  I am a T 6 incomplete here and while very different from your injury I believe the perspective is the same   The first step to having a relationship with someone else is having a healthy relationship with yourself Learn to be happy with how and who you are be thankful for being alive and focus on your recovery One day at a time life gets better and brighter   Once you have your happiness in order and you can socialize and make relationships with others a relationship will happen Again focus on hobbies things to keep your mind busy and topics and ideas that could help you relate to others and form those relationships   To try and force a relationship is dangerous as you can become too reliant on them for your happiness and you can lose focus in taking care of yourself   A quote that has helped me significantly in this very difficult time  about 1 5years since injury for me  is  if you live in the past you re depressed if you live in the future you re anxious learn to live in the moment we are in right now     I have a relationship myself and I know plenty others with SCI that have healthy relationships as well You are not worthless and there is a match out there for you   Best of luck in the future I ll be keeping you in my prayers Stay strong and keep fighting    I know it s very different but I am T12 complete and very happy in a relationship despite all the challenges that come with wheelchair life I have a friend who is also C3 and he is married and very happy  I think the most important thing is to accept yourself and surround yourself with positive people and try to do as much as you can if you are happy in yourself you will attract the right person  There is someone for everyone You may not be the fully functioning person you used to be but maybe now you re an excellent listener or sounding board for someone who just wants to be with a kind person who s supportive I agree with the above statements to be yourself be confident Roll into the room with BDE You will meet the right person for you It usually happens when you re not looking  C2 C5 6 incomplete I have limited upper body mobility but not to the extent of zero arm function as a lot of people have said down below   every injury is individual   But that being said the self esteem thing is pretty common and it might be worth trying to work to get that up   personally I found engaging in things I liked helped out massively with that When your self esteem is higher the injury becomes less of a barrier   like I needed to  and need to ongoing work  to learn to value myself regardless of physical function and the more progress I make on this the better things become  I m a C4 complete I met my wife 9 years after my accident I had a few girlfriends after my accident too but none of them worked out thankfully My best advice is that you can t depend on others for happiness I promise that no relationship can work if you are unable to be happy with yourself Accepting your situation is important and living life to your fullest is a great quality Don t settle and don t feel sorry for yourself Things will work out Having the right attitude goes a long way  Okay so looks like I m the first to write who is able bodied but I m going to write something here from a reverse perspective   I am 31 and a year ago I was at a conference I met a wholesome amazing guy with a beautiful smile He was at a table to promote the spinal cord injury of Ontario I couldn t stop thinking about him do the next day I found him exchanged Facebook and a month later we where dating      I m a PSW so somethings I knew but there was A LOT I didn t And I ll be blunt to by saying as a psw I didn t think I would date anyone in a wheelchair because I wanted work and social to be separate   my boyfriend of almost a year C6  T1 complete   he makes his disability fun I mean there of course is the chronic pain which is stressful and seeing him in pain kills me But he lets me sit on him in his chair   and makes hilarious jokes about his disability Flops his feet over mine when we are in bed   I think his confidence and his way of not being offended by disability and humour helped ease me into this new way of life Of course my life changed   and sometimes it s stressful but him always staying positive helps I know that can be hard sometimes but it s nice when it s a horrible situation and you can both laugh   Like this past New Years we where late for a magic show   we got off the subway and it wasn t accessible  0 rather than wait for another subway I stood behind him  beer was involved in this decision  and we went up the escalator Only to find a staircase  Omg so we laughed and I finally got us through the gate  I wasn t wide enough for a chair so I had to really push  and then a random couple helped us carry him up the staircase while my boyfriend pulled on railing to help   It could have been stressful but we laughed the whole time   Your disability is definitely a new life it doesn t have to define who you are   it is apart of you but not who you are So make that life still fun and adventurous And when something gets you down just laugh about it turn it into a joke and make life just fun   Hope this helps and it has helped my relationship 100  I just posted a very long comment trying to get to the same point and I think I ve horribly failed You did it in two sentences  Is anyone else getting pissed of at all these people misusing the ADA so they don t have to wear a mask It makes me absolutely livid My husband is C5 C6 incomplete so his SCI affects his lung function and makes him susceptible to respiratory infections These people don t give one single fuck if their actions kill people They re just being completely selfish and have no clue what the ADA says or who it s supposed to protect   I m sorry you had to deal with that asshole What was the conclusion of that encounter  Agree I m so disgusted by people who are saying   I can t use a mask I have a medical condition  now I don t know if that s true or not I m leaning toward it s not However I too have a medical condition  T 4 incomplete  and if my van is broken down then I m not going to the store I m not going anywhere  driving distance  and unfortunately someone else has to help me Why can t these people with this medical condition that stops them from wearing a mask get someone else to do their shopping  It s not that serious to them   Im sure that they can wear a mask they just don t want to And it is because they are selfish and don t care about anyone else Kudos to you for still working Sorry about the ADA asshole some people are just assholes  Given the extreme rarity of disability that prevents people from wearing a mask it s not unreasonable for people to carry a doctors note  It s angering yes   I think it s kind of funny that they argue the ADA   HIPAA with a person who clearly knows what it s about  Yes  According to the CDC there are 3 cases that prevent people from wearing masks    1   Children under 2  2   Difficulty breathing  3   Basically be unconscious  All 3 of these do not require an MD to diagnose   2 could be argued but it s pretty damn obvious when a person has trouble breathing  I ve heard so many excuses for the  medical  reasons for people not wearing a mask I m not buying their shit and I d thank them to not bastardize the ADA to fit your selfish oft politically driven narrative Wear a damn mask  The ADA was written with infectious disease  HIV  in mind which was one of its most controversial parts It offered protections against discrimination for HIV people working in food service because you can t get HIV like that But it does not obligate businesses to make exceptions for either customers or employees who are actually potentially infectious  pretty much all of us at the moment   I pointed out that the ADA calls for reasonable accommodations and that we met those standards He got mad and told me he wasn t going to argue with me and stormed off inside the store SCI Women Research StudyDr Al Emondi from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  discussing Non Surgical Brain Computer InterfacesI guess you need a very very good EEG for that to begin with  My amazing boyfriend is raising money for the Spinal Cord Injury of Ontario He found an innovative way to raise donations by doing Ubereats in his wheelchair Love this man Stay cool and hydrated  I have two questions about complete SCI Injuries I feel you mann  In the same boat I am a t10 complete for 10yrs and over the years there have been many claims from the so called stem cell treatment but it doesn t work and sensation aren t regained Still a lot of research is happening on this But none that worked As for the penis size I would say try viagra or tadalaphil based tablet Used for erectile dysfunction Consult a physician before or pharmacist I personally feel after accident I don t get full erection as I used to before the accident Tablets did well But something felt empty deep inside I have the same self conscious Also in my head orgasm is being able to ejaculate And I am unable to so   When you get into a relationship you will have to find your erogenous areas There s more to coitus than penetration they say Non penetrative did help me to its max but not the climax feel  Weird got injured younger than you and my penis grew normally have you consulted a doctor I also have a complete injury   Nope there are no cures for SCI There are various efforts to cure SCI but most funding goes to care   You dick is like any part of your body if you don t use it it atrophies I was injured when I was 40 and mine is noticably smaller 11 years later It doesn t work so I don t care but if you do get a penis pump It possible insurance will even pay for it   If you get lucky enough to get laid get the injection don t waste money on pills  I have not consulted a doctor yet  Thank you for all the tips you gave and replying so fast Thank you for the fast response and the tips New Carer looking to hear your story Hi   My boyfriend is an incomplete C6  motorcycle accident  and was actually at shepherd until early June In fact he was first diagnosed as complete but later determined incomplete He first arrived in early March barely able to move his arms Some great things that have happened is that the drs there were very helpful in finding the right pain   spams meds In fact he was able to stop using the Percocet completely by the time he left Also definitely take advantage of the assistive technology resources they have There are a bunch of mobile apps they have than can help replace remotes   In terms of improvements in early March he was bedridden by late March he was transitioning into an electric wheelchair and by mid May he is in a manual wheelchair He has gained a lot of core strength and can transfer using a board w  some assistance His hands have opened up and he is able to grasp somewhat and use his thumb decently It s almost 6 months post injury and progress can seem slow but slow progress is still progress He sometimes has some feeling in his toes and left leg so we are hoping for even more of a recovery   Shepherd is a great place to be at for SCI and wish you all the best  Hi I m 25 and a T7 I was injured in an automobile accident last year My recovery has had ups and downs especially due to quarantine but overall I ve made significant improvements   While in rehab from November to January I went from being unable to sit up to being able to transfer without assistance and able to do other small things like turn myself in bed  When I returned home I began strengthening those things and can now crawl and balance pretty when reaching although there s still a long way to go   I definitely still struggle with pain and weakness but I ve been using different methods to help with those kind of things   It s a long journey and everybody is different I find the most difficult thing to deal with is even while I make improvements it feels so slow and minor sometimes so I have to remind myself where I started I m currently unable to work and school was too difficult for me in regards to stamina but I m improving myself and caring for my daughter and just going day by day   I wish both of you luck on this journey and feel free to continue reaching out    Hi T10 complete Became a para 10 yrs ago in a road traffic accident Went to rehab 1 month after the surgery My mum came along with me during the 3 month rehab stint What I would definitely say is develop a schedule in rehab Work with therapists and understand the schedule that works best And see how it can be integrated into your husband s work schedule The 3 months I spent in rehab I learnt to make sure the first thing I do every day without fail is my morning chores aka DE bathing I do it everyday and I use suppository daily for it keeps me free from any worry of a bad stomach at any point during later part of the day I developed a schedule to pee this now has helped me realize how much fluid I can take until I will not have a leak I do forget sometimes but majority times I can be worry free These 2 aspects are critical for me to keep a proper outdoor lifestyle balance too Go to pubs disc s concerts shows I also learnt not to hesitate when I need help And be ready with spare set of diapers if traveling anywhere   Where I am getting to is in my opinion developing a schedule has helped me a lot I also made sure I develop enough upper body strength in rehab cuz when I get to my daily life I will not be able to devote time for that I work full time clocking upwards of 9hrs every day as an IT consultant I also take off from work for any peer mentoring sessions or helps   testing out new beta versions of custom wheelchairs being developed in my country It doesn t have insurance through which we can buy good wheelchair It s an out of pocket expense and the best ones are available abroad and cost a bomb I also did some fashion shows in between   I am gifted to have a huge and strong support system in my friends family and work Work cuz i had my position available when I joined back at work Friends cuz one or the other made sure to drop a call every weekend during my stint at rehab Family and extended family for the kept pushing me to do better In rehab fortunately I also had my mentor  T5 complete for 30yrs now  admitted around the same time next room for a different issue I would speak to him almost every other day to understand how life will be when I get back to work And I had decided then itself I will not waste my energy trying to walk Spending time and energy on something that will not come will exhaust me from spending that time and energy elsewhere This was in my opinion choice which helped me grow in my career relatively fast and also live a fuller life I had my goal for rehab clear be an efficient chair user   Post my surgery when I reached rehab and got to know I will never walk I didn t exactly process it properly Or I processed it and didn t affect me much Emotionally I was ok Mentally I accepted and just lived on It took 10 yrs for me to realize that I have only grown old not grown up And that s why it didn t affect me   My proposal to the love of my life fixing the date of marriage and then getting cheated upon and dumped shattered me and made me penniless 2years ago Another broken relationship 4 months back taught me I was not ready yet for a new one Cuz I still had not grown up And this lockdown has just taught me these things Now I have realized that I am really short tempered I scream at my folks if things are not done as I want and sort of have OCD  I think  I have started to meditate now hopefully I resolve my anger issues What I am getting to is with life altering event like Spinal cord injury something changes at the core of a person And until the person realizes it he or she would run in auto pilot mode Some will be visible some invisible And no one can find it unless the person makes an effort   PS  doctor who the new series which started in 2005 changed and taught me life lessons that I should have learnt or known in my younger days And talks by Jordan Peterson have helped me learn that life is full of suffering It is how I find happiness in those suffering and rise above it to lead a balanced life that is important  https   www facebook

negatives If you don t then it will grind you both down     Hi I m a personal assistant and have been working for people with SCI for a year One resource that I found helpful was the Attitude YouTube channel and website It s mostly people from NZ and Australia and there is a playlist if people with various levels of spinal cord injuries talking about their experiences Maybe it might be useful for you All the best for you and your partner   Wow Thank you so much for responding  It s like reading my own story about Also with the left leg and the toes it s just crazy Question for you is he home now How do you emotionally deal with his caregiver  assuming he has one And how long  assuming he has a caregiver  are they with you each day See we have 3 kids and I m just not excited about bringing in a outsider  but this isn t about me I keep telling myself Thank you I ll definitely look into them Anyone use abdominal binders For maybe six months in the beginning when I first got home from rehab The fianc  liked that it kept my belly from bulging out It feels kind of comforting but I also used to think Kevlar bodyarmor felt comforting all day It doesn t feel that bad and it does also help support your internal organs  and your weak ass diaphragm  Mainly we got tired of the daily ritual of putting it on and occasionally it would slip out of place causing a pinched piece of skin that I wasn t aware of until there was a sore at the end of the day Now I don t use them at all but I can see a place for them again for special occasions such as a wedding reception or something but not just for daily use  Hey sorry I m a little late to the party on this but I actually use this back brace and its worked great   https   www healthproductsforyou com p hely weber lei back brace html gclid Cj0KCQjw4f35BRDBARIsAPePBHy7uGmKB3uAwmv7ees2CUMZUBGXPVd0AzvqBMHUhsvan8R7ZmHSZl8aAsSKEALw_wcB  I m a c6 7 quad with no movement below the chest but even with only one pec muscle working about 2 3 5 tricep function and no hand function outside of tenodesis with practice I ve been able to learn to put it on by myself  Though it s definitely easier when wearing my gripping gloves  I use gloves4life   but I notice a huge difference I don t slouch near as much while wearing it   It s completely soft so no pinching and the double bind really helps to get a good fit The pad in the back also helps with spinal posture a bit too There are some spring supports on the sides which keep it from folding over on itself which have popped out before but I just had someone pop em back in and reinforce the stitching and I haven t had a problem again  otherwise going on two years strong even with the occasional wash  Cool thanks for telling me   and yeah its about support and posture for me mostly because my posture is just terrible following my injury Organ support doesn t sound bad either I hear it can improve your cough That deep pressure thing with like the Kevlar I really like that as well so cool   I ll watch out for it slipping though that could be a problem Can you provide a link to the one you used The Perfect Step Claremont CaliforniaThis is my place Everyone here are

British Columbia you should check out direct funding if you aren t already on it It s self directed attendant care you can hire whom ever you choose and spread your care throughout the day in small increments  Then your dog can be taken care of during these times You might not be able to walk your do every time but at least you can enjoy it s company  When you do have a worker get them to walk your dog while you re doing something else like eating or something you usually can do on your own or even when the laundry is being done This will optimize your time with your dog and be efficient when you have a worker  You can use the worker for this the worker can take your dog out and he can do his business  the after you can go out with your dog on your own without having to worry about picking anything up Hope this helps    May I ask where you live I m not sure why I thought Canada The Uk has direct funding too That s where self directed care started Dogs are amazing though The reason I wrote all of that is I myself am a PSW for people on direct funding and that s how they take care of their dogs  I am not in Canada I think for the trouble cats may be the best for me Which is fine Cats are hilarious and sweet too Cool I live in the USA   California area I have not done any research what government assistance is available I am not on any welfare system myself I m a regular dude with a job and bills as far as the government knows Home HealthGet in touch with Vocational Rehab or Department for Aging and Independent living They might be able to help  Private pay most likely Your primary physician should be helping you with decisions like this They re going to know of programs and who administrates them For instance my local hospital has a complex case management team which is a social worker and a nurse that helps navigates problems like this I was in a similar situation as you except that I was on SSDI which has its benefits Eventually my dad was going to die and I needed to reassure him that we had a plan in place for the moment that happened I would ve been lost without them  https   hhs texas gov services health medicaid chip programs services children adults disabilities medicaid buy adults  Consider something like a Medicaid buy in It is income limited though  Late to the party but what this guy said   The office of vocational rehab has helped me tremendously They re a state program designed to help get keep disabled individuals working Paying for home health to get ready for work is still a lot cheaper for the state than having to pay you benefits  you should be able to get help there I agree with this I came here to recommend it  In many states they are allowing you to buy into Medicaid if your salary is as high as  100k  The buy in can bridge the gap between disqualifying for Medicaid  I think it s something like  15  25k year  and being able to afford it yourself     x200B   If you are on Medicaid you can either work with an agency or get a consumer directed services account  my preferred method   It looks like Texas has this    https   hhs texas gov doing business hhs provider portals long term care

practicitioner family physician first and then ask for a referral to appropriate specialists  neurologist etc    You might also look at whatever hospital treats inpatient spinal cord injury and see if they have an outpatient program I see a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation  PM R  physician  also called physiatrist  at a big rehab hospital near me They have helped me adjust my medications and wrote the prescription for my wheelchair and anything else SCI related  Hey I m from Ireland too and weirdly a L1 incomplete but from different reasons then yours The only way you ll get to see a consultant is by referral from your GP Not sure where in the country you are but Beaumont hospital is the place to be imo specialises in all things neurological the NRH is the rehab centre and depending on your needs you might be referred there for further assistance  they are amazing   if you re a public patient you could be waiting 3 months for an appointment but if you re private you ll

backsYep there s a penisHow many of you are in chronic pain Do you still enjoy life I have a condition only doctors or people that have it would recognize mine is from an accident   Finding the right dose of neurological meds  lyrica or neurotonin  helped me a lot   I manage my pain with medical THC it works well Sometimes I reach for my pain meds but it s a huge difference I d be on them every day if not for it  I get a lot of neuropathic pain in my right leg from my injury Pain meds and other treatments have not been able to help In the next month I should be trying a spinal cord stimulator implant and I have high hopes for that The pain is often pretty unbearable and leaves me bed bound many days   I m sorry you re in so much pain I hope you can find something that helps Try to get a good pain doctor and if one isn t working for you try a different one I m on my second pain doctor now and I m really glad I switched The last one just had treatments that weren t helping my pain   Good luck Stay strong  I don t know how to enjoy life in this condition idk what fun is anymore and it s only a matter of time til I call it quits I had bad nerve pain at first for the first 2 or so years once I was otherwise ready to go back to school  I was 16  I still missed more school than I attended because of my nerve pain I found the right combo of meds to be able to function so I graduated from high school and went to college I was on lyrica 150 mg 3x day and that worked pretty well I still have pain now but i m off all the meds   even though I have pain all the time i m glad to be here as long as I keep myself busy and focus on having a good future the pain isn t as distressing I still have pain but it s not as emotionally taxing to live with  I have rather chronic pain but I m able to live with it Mine didn t really develop until after my second spinal surgery fix a syrinx I tried Lyrica and the others but it made me really spacey so I stopped so if it After a while I am just able to live with it and it only cause a problem if I try to lay on my back One thing I ve found that helps is a heating pad i use one at night to sooth nerve pain while i sleep  I have a C level SCI 2 lesions and it causes chronic pain  mixture of nerve pain and muscular pain from spasticty  I ve been on really intense pain meds before including most variants of nerve pain meds but am now getting by on the highest dose of cocodamol I can get in my country It s an opioid sure but its not morphine or fentanyl   I do enjoy life when I can access things I function very well and engage in sports as well as various other hobby acivties and am a very busy arts freelancer access auditor I don t find my pain majorly impacts my well being most days its just something I had to get used to  It s tough to manage For me it s seems the harder I push in PT the worse the pain is the next couple of days but mentally the gains outweigh the pain Antispasm meds seem to have either reached the tolerance level or the negative side effects keep me from using some of them Plenty of rest hydration and BCAA or other muscle soothing protein help  I have bad neuropathy from an incomplete L1 injury 13 years ago I have good days and bad I take gabapentin which helps but I get nothing for the extreme breakthrough pain I often get I honestly feel abandoned by my pain doctor  C4 complete with chronic pain here Some days are better than others but overall if I could use one of my arms to take something or I could find someone to help me without them risking going to jail I would already be gone  I take neurontin and that seems to be the only thing that helps I was on methadone but decided to ween off of it  it took a year  Methadone made me too foggy and forgetful I decided being a lot more lucid and in pain was better than being drugged up or passed out   I ve tried tons of different opioids and even had a spinal cord pain stimulator implanted then later removed because it didn t work   The pain gets to me emotionally from time to time and slows down my life even more than the wheelchair does I enjoy life as best I can   Does the pain depress me Of course but I just try to pick up and move forward  It s amino acid to help muscle recovery All the nutrition shops sell them Good luck I have been living with the pain for 10 yrs now T10 complete here And I opted to not take any medications Decided to live with it I do some push ups on my wheelchair to relieve the pain if the pain comes while sitting lift myself up pressing against the wheels  Nowadays I found a new trick which seems to work If I get pain on the right side I move my right abdomen muscles giving the false impression about body movements Which reduces the pain much sooner While earlier I just used stop breathing for 30 seconds or sitting push ups to divert the attention from neuro pain  when I had my wreck I landed on my left arm and bc of it I have constant needle like nerve pain on top of hot cold sensations in it all day I take gabapentin and oxycodone but it never goes away it impacts me so much and I d be so much further in my recovery if it wasn t a constant problem I am thinking about medical THC I just don t like the feeling of being high  it makes me anxious Maybe with the right strain Good luck with the stimulator It s definitely an odd feeling Hey thanks  I hope the stimulator works I know many have had good success How long have you had a SCI Thanks that has helped me as well in the past but I quit using it I found magnesium Theronate helps me to sleep I guess it can be something you just eventually get used to in a way Thanks for the motivation  I hope you continue to enjoy your life Worried about doing PT because I have nerve damage Glad to hear it helps mentally for you I ll look into the bcaasIt s crazy that pain doctors can t won t properly treat pain I have cymbalta but don t want to deal with the side effects Have you tried LDN Sorry  it s really rough I am only 3 4 months into this and I ve already had a enough Hang in there though probably doesn t mean much but message me whenever Have you tried low dose naltrexone I have had some success with it Always a beast  but not always success initially but never stopping Happy Sunday to everyone Motivation to get up and do something today Myself included I m so sore and spasms are ripping on me hard the last 2 days Thursday and Friday PT was a killer I participated in a disability film challenge and made a short documentary about the history of spinal cord injuries in filmNice job  Good job  Searching for a new backup catheterI m a para but have you looked at the hollister VaPro plus pocket Foil packet with a loop to tear open then simply remove the red cap and go ahead All enclosed as close to sterile as possible Yep Not a man but for some reason I know that many male tetra friends of mine like the VaPro Plus ones as well After a disabled Tesla user reached out to Elon Musk Tesla will now install powered trunks for wheelchairusers at no cost I love Tesla s features hate that I d have to live in it to be able to afford one  Now put a ramp in a Model X and I ll buy one  I reached out a few times about a Model X  Wanting to know if the rear back seat on the drivers could be removed and my wheelchair placed there  It would be close to perfect for me  but I never heard back  What s a powers trunk  Trunk that uses power to open and close  standard on the S  Pretty sure it s just for that guy No one can honestly afford that Is there any wonder why the world loves Elon   37k for Model 3 SR  and the cost of operating is 5x less than a gas car It s cheaper over 10 years to drive than a Camry or Accord Anything can be removed 1 time  Whether you can put it back afterward is the question  If you have the 4 or 6 seat config it should be trivial to remove that seat A powered tail gate One that has a motor to open and close itself All Teslas but the model 3 have one They re now saying that individuals who otherwise wouldn t be able to reach the trunk door when it s opened can get one retrofitted on the model 3 free of charge it seems  37k for Model 3 SR  and the cost of operating is 5x less than a gas car It s cheaper over 10 years to drive than a Camry or Accord  Stolen from u dcdttu  uhhh there s a lot to wonder actuallyShare your recoveries Marcus C 7 Incomplete Fused from C 4 to T 3 Paralyzed chest down initially movement slowly came back 2 3 months later Went from Wheelchair to Walker Walker to Forearm Crutch Forearm Crutch to No Assistance over the course of 9 years Even though I was able to walk without assistance my walking for was very knock kneed until recently receiving very intense 2 hours a day therapy at The Perfect Step in Claremont California where they re taught me how to walk 9 years post injury Now able to walk with no brace or walking assistance  Broke C2 C5 C6 Fused C4 C7 Initially C5 Asia A my injury is incomplete Two weeks out Asia B two months out Asia C I m currently 1yr post injury and am now Asia D Couldn t move a thing from my shoulders down and now I can walk without any assistive devices I m so grateful and lucky Love you guys  I am a T8 complete injured on 2009 In 2020 I am a T8 complete  T1 T8 incomplete Asia C Currently Asia D At 3 months I could walk short distances with a walker but relied on a wheelchair mostly I had to wear a diaper for bladder control At 6 months I could walk longer distances with a walker and around the house and only used the wheelchair outside the home Still needed a diaper At 9 months I stopped using the wheelchair at all and relied on the walker alone outside the home with a cane inside I could walk a mile with the walker and needed incontinence pads for my bladder At 12 months I walked short distances outside the home with a cane and needed smaller incontinence pads At 15 months I used the cane exclusively outside the home and walked unassisted inside At 18 months I walked unassisted at all times except for very long distances I m currently using the lightest incontinence pads My bowel situation is unchanged since day one and I require a bowel program every other day The neuropathy and spasticity in my legs is unchanged from day one and I have continued stiffness and discomfort from my thighs down I can feel pressure cold and  something s wrong  in my legs but my ability to feel heat and pain is impaired  I can walk assisted with a walker for a short distance I think mostly supporting my weight while standing is the problem  Thats seriously amazing It must feel great especially after such a long effort Did your recovery slow down after a certain point What could you do at 4 months Im asking because thats where I am at now This got a laugh out of me but even some initially complete injuries have the possibility to recover That improvement is impressive These injuries cause so many problems other than what is obvious at a glance but walking is still my biggest goal and stories like these give me hope Healing With Meditation my mom s described doing something similar  not meditation but still  and credits it to fixing her scoliosis It sounds like biofeedback therapy to me So basically what happens is this  when you have a spinal cord injury the paralyzed body parts atrophy over time Sometimes the nerves might heal enough to begin moving the body part again but it s so atrophied that your brain has sort of forgotten how to do it With biofeedback and or mediation you can retrain the brain to connect to these atrophied parts and start building them up a bit But generally any gains are small Christopher Reeve famously regained the ability to wiggle his fingers after extensive therapy for example  Botox injections in bladderBotox is one of the best things for those of us with SCI It s drastically improved my quality of life  I know what that s like  I used to have to map out the bathrooms at a location before I got there no time for risks lol   Botox is amazing for me It usually lasts a long time for me around 12 14 months I do IC The worst it when I go to sporting events The bathrooms are always disgusting and I m trying to cath with a million people waiting in line   I had one bad day on Saturday I must have used a dozen catheters Kept feeling the urge all day to go every hour Ends up making me irritated I ordered hydrophilic catheters with a 12 FR size to try and help with that I think it s getting better now but I won t judge for another week or two   The best thing is being able to sleep longer Now I only wake up due to crippling anxiety How has your view of   relationship with God changed since your injury I was atheist before and was atheist after I dropped LSD 6 months ago and am now Daoist  Pretty much the same I m somewhere between agnostic and a deist I guess   I did grow a distaste towards people accrediting God to any progress I made though while in the hospital rehab system I d like to think that my efforts in conjuncture with the doctors got me to where I am I use to not mind when people said things like that but when it s directed at you it feels kind of demoralizing and takes your own will out of the equation which let s be honest is the most important part of living with this kind of injury  Not at all still an atheist  Raised catholic but was athiest After a few decades of psychedelics I very much in the Alan Watts  We are the universe experiencing itself  camp  I was an agnostic atheist before and an even stronger atheist afterwards I do like the teachings of buddhism aside from the mysticism The concept of accepting that life is suffering seems extraordinarily relevant to me Especially as a methodology to reduce that by accepting the impermanence of life   I found the patients who kept telling me to pray on the whole struggled to accept their own situation Although that could ve been down to the individuals of course It was by learning and listening to Western Buddhism that really helped me through some of the worst Just my opinion  Pretty much the same depth and breadth as my relationship with Zeus or Thanos   I m grateful that I don t have some omnipotent father figure that chose not to intervene in my injury and recovery I feel sorry for people who do  I used to believe il n god never liked churches but used to pray every night before sleep After the injury I no longer believe in god I do believe there is more to this universe and reality but god from traditional religion is not a thing  I was Christian before and Christian after I feel that my faith strengthened significantly though after I find solace and peace in my faith and truly believe God has a plan for my life and everything has a purpose Yeah I agree it might sound cult ish But that s not how I meant it You re right it s dangerous in fact to think of your beliefs as absolute facts But the absolute facts I believe in are love and peace The stories surrounding that get complicated through religion and yes people fight so much via religion So while I take every religious doctrine with a grain of salt  and flat out reject many  I do not need to analyze my understanding of the innate peace and love in the Universe That s God Whether you think of it as a single creator or a benevolent energy or refuse to acknowledge it at all that s God to me and no one can change my mind on that I ve witnessed it countless times through profound spiritual experiences The thing about peace and love is that it doesn t need analyzed further The stories are complicated and have problems but peace and love is just peace and love The problems come from the interpretation of people on what peace and love should look like  I was an atheist then thought I was having a spiritual awakening  nope  psychosis first time ever  which contributed to my wreck now I m c7 incomplete and more of an atheist than I ever was which is hard bc in any support group everyone s always telling you to trust god or some shit yes tried that out and that s why I m here  I m certainly more grateful and confident of peace in the afterlife Any worries of wrath and hell have disappeared   deleted  The Tao Te Ching is so beautiful The way is the way in all its beauty and sorrow Agree you did your hard work It s ok to be grateful to God that you were able to recover but you don t deserve to be discredited for your hard work I know how insane PT and just living with this injury can be I was very annoyed after my injury I was in Dubai and whenever I would ask the doctors about my diagnosis they d say inshallah  God willing  and I was like  God wills that you as the doctor give me the statistical diagnosis for my injury not just keep telling me I d walk again inshallah When I moved my toes for the first time my aunt said thank god Not one word to me about my hard work or to my therapist It s been 11 years and I still get mad when I think about it I have been nihilistic and agnostic in my earlier life but any stop through atheism didn t last long because I think it s arrogant to be alive for a few decades and outright say there is no God A creator would have worked far longer than a few decades so to me it s ignorant to say there s definitely no God That said it doesn t matter if you believe in God or not so long as you care to be a good person to yourself and those you interact with I am heavily Buddhist in my spirituality as well I believe they have the purest form of the message and are the strongest promoters of peace Do you believe in the afterlife Has this made it harder to continue on Its better to enter the kingdom of God maimed than to spend eternity in hellI experienced ego death too It was after my injury and it was clear to me that my entire life led up to that ego death Then I regained my ego slowly and authentically and I feel so  me now What was your experience like Self Catheters and InfectionsNot a man but I just use a standard wet wipe  not antibacterial  and catheterise which is how I was taught by the hospital I have eczema so I wash my hands before catheterising with Hydramol  which is antimicrobial but not antibacterial  I only ever use antibacterial gel when travelling and only then if I can t access soap or need to wipe down surfaces in a public bathroom When we re not in Covid times I regularly use pub restaurant airport etc bathrooms without much trouble I just take regular wipes with me and a small bottle of antibacterial gel but most of the time I don t even use the gel   I m in the UK and anecdotally I d say that we re more reticent to overly sterilise with antibacterial gels etc because it can inhibit your body s inherent ability to fight off infections and antibacterial resistance is a real problem I rarely get UTIs and the only thing I take to prevent treat them is D Mannose  I get a powder that I add to my smoothie but I only use it when travelling or if I think I already have an infection  I used to buy those urine testing strips which were really useful in the early days of my injury but since UTIs aren t common for me these days I don t really keep them in stock any more  they tend to have a limited shelf life  But everyone is different Have you had a UTI or other infection since your injury   You might also find the SCI Owners  Club Facebook group helpful   it shouldn t be taken as medical advice but you ll get a LOT of real world experiences from people who ve been living with spinal cord injuries for years or decades Again anecdotally but I d say your routine is in the minority and I d agree more on the side of your urologist s office in that it s overkill But obviously I am not a doctor and not familiar with your specific case or how likely you are to get UTIs so please take everything I ve said with that in mind  The alcohol is overkill IMO Men s anatomy might be different but that is a big no no for the ladies An iodine swab should have already done the job   although nobody s told me to wait 15 seconds I imagine that s to let whatever bacteria die and then you wipe them away with the alcohol If so rinsing with clean water after the iodine should do the trick I ve always just let the iodine do its job and go in right after   Some urologists prescribe antibiotics left and right some allow bacteria to exist and prescribe only when you ve got a fever I think you re seeing a similar divide in opinion on how sterile you need to be   doctors in general haven t seemed to reach on consensus on how to view bacteria   Perhaps your hands could be cleaner though If you re washing then touching your pants and getting everything in position you re hands are no longer sterile You could use sanitizer just before you touch the catheter or put on gloves or just make sure your not touching any part of the catheter that makes it in Again with male anatomy this might be out of the question  That is about it actually Just remember to wash your hands properly and use sterilized gloves It may also take some time to get adjusted to this new routine  My husband is  C6 incomplete He uses the coloplast speedicath  first link  with baby wipes he has added rubbing alcohol to Luckily he doesn t have to touch the tube or anything to cath since the speedicath is fairly rigid   He also takes a cranberry supplement with PACs  second link  Here s had a few mild UTIs but he s never been hospitalized for one or needed antibiotics for one since about 6 months out of the hospital   https

vegetarian capsules product 100463241 html Utterly anecdotal but I wonder if the frequency is relevant    L1 incomplete 10 years    I ve never had a UTI and I don t do any prep whatsoever before using the catheter I use the same type of catheter as you    The only difference is I catheterise at least 8 times a day    I have no idea whether the frequency is significant or if I m just very lucky  I am female and use baby wipes after washing my hands and using a towel that is just for me and my hands I m methodical and clean but still get infections and sepsis three times Unfortunate side effect I did start to trial something called hyastat  sp   that they put into the bladder via the urethra and was infection free for nine months It lines the bladder to help stop bacteria settling Unfortunately with covid I ve no been able to have it done I ve had a couple of infections but not bad enough  almost  to be hospitalised Perhaps enquire UK here  I am T10 for 10 years Been on self Catheterization the whole time rarely got infections And the infections I got were quickly cleared in 3 days thanks to the meds I took I do not follow any protocol for catheterization Ultra basic system is what I have Show Catheter under tap water put few drops of lignocaine gel on the tip of the catheter and insert Empty the urine in a medium sized bowl and then into the commode Rinse both under tap water again and rinse and flush Also clean the head of my penis with wet cloth  wipes In and out max 5 minutes Did this when I traveled abroad too I have gone to clubs movies road trips concerts and quite a few places and all I needed was a restroom where my wheelchair could enter What I was taught during my rehab was what you said  clean the head of the penis with iodine wash hands with soap etc But after speaking to my mentor I found it impractical And went to simpler approach Of course cleaning the head of the penis is needed  impressions of hygiene in front of your partner if you are in a relationship  I didn t clean the head until I saw a cringe worthy reaction in my ex s face And another ex telling me I should always do it   My fluid intake varies according to the weather In summer more intake but don t go for as many restroom breaks May be 3 4 sometimes 2 But in winter I do it almost every 1 5hrs Also break frequency increases if I go drinking Like almost every hour or 1 5 hrs a restroom break I use those lofric Catheters and re use them for roughly 60 90 days or so Here in India rehab also recommend re use But that s for a rusch catheter for 20 30 days Catheters are stored in a simple cloth bag   Now I cannot say if Indian weather is conducive for such a laxed Catheterizing protocol but it works for me and many I know I would definitely say account your surroundings temperature and decide on the frequency of restroom breaks But bring a system System is important I always made sure I pee ed every 3 4hrs during the first 1 1 5 years And ensured I drank enough water  at least 2 lites  In our local forums for Sci some say cranberry juice has helped them to manage UTIs  I didn t see anywhere you mention wearing gloves so sorry if I missed it but you must wear like a latex glove Even surgeons who wash the crap outta their hands wear gloves for surgery I take Methenamine to help combat the onset of a UTI My urologist also gives me a mild antibiotic that I take a few times a week to also help I might also suggest making sure your really clean after a bowel movement which may or may not apply to you Additionally check what you re drinking Stay away from sugar drinks I know if I have a Coke or liquor I m gonna get a UTI Just my thoughts Good luck   T5 Male Incomplete  I suffered with persistent UTI s for the first few years when I was always very sterile I will try and make a long story short   I changed to using a white tip  smaller  chemically polished catheter called  Apogee  Turned out that most of my infections were from trauma   Now I use water as lube with a non scented wipe Scented and anti bacterial wipes do more harm then good I NEVER clean my catheter I reuse it for months without cleaning I only change it when it becomes too hard due to its age   Sounds crazy but I NEVER have UTI s anymore I m T12 complete male   Speedicaths 4 5 times a day Every time I ve given a urine sample there has been an infection but I m 99  of the time asymptomatic I dont have a procedure for catheterising The only thing I try to do is not touch the tube just the connection Unless Im out in a public toilet most of the time I dont bother to wash my hands   if I ve been cooking or outside at all I ll wash my hands but most of the time no   It s a shame youre having such issues but from my limited experience  living with SCI since Jan 2017  it just seems everyone is different A good friend of mine T4 complete has been hospitalised 2 3times a year since I ve known him   Hope you manage to work something out though I could imagine it d be a serious pain to deal with  I have had an infection more often than not since my injury it seems like Twice I ended up in the hospital for a few days Never had one go away without antibiotics I don t think it s a good idea at all to always be on antbiotics but idk how else to keep the infections in check yet Maybe my bladder will adapt over time Yeah the alcohol wipe is mostly for cleaning off the iodine residue although the doctors said it would add some minuscule additional protection along with the iodine I find it easier than rinsing with water after I m all done and don t want that orange stain to just be left there I have the speedicaths so the only part of the catheter I touch is at the end that doesn t come near the urethra opening when fully inserted I have sometimes pulled my pants down first but again in public how do I wash my hands with my pants already down How do I close the stall door without contaminating my hands Again though I don t ever come near my urethra opening with my hands anyway I have the same speedicaths so I don t touch the tube at all during the process Hearing how it s not as big of a deal for most people like your husband makes me think I m doing something fundamentally wrong How much liquid are you drinking everyday I would think every extra catheter is another exposure chance to bacteria and I definitely don t produce enough urine to warrant 8 times a day As mentioned in another comment though maybe I need to stay uncomfortably hydrated all the time I also catheterize a few times a day and all I do is remove the catheter from the package and insert I use the Cure Ultra pre lubricated ones They come with a little plastic sleeve that I grab the catheter with I ve been doing this a few years and have never had an UTI One step forward two steps back deleted  I had a baclofen pump put in for my muscle spasms and it s been a fantastic solution  The downside is it has to be surgically implanted and you have to have it refilled with new medication every 6 months and the pump itself has to be replaced every 5 years If you can handle that though it s a great potential option  I know every injury us different I m c6 c7 also got injured 2 and a half years ago When they transferred me to a rehab the list of medications I was taking was really scary On top of everything I ve had what s heterotopic osification on my hip it s kinda matured now So I fought a lot with doctors first to drop the nerve pain medications like gabapentin pain was horrible for almost 2 years but gabapentin slowed down my brain big time I also dropped almost all pain medications on 2and or 3rd month maybe it was dumb but sho ui kder pain went away also around 6 months in I also dropped my blood pressure meds and it took awhile for it to stabilize a little by itself It still drops once or twice a day Bowel was a nightmare in rehab for some reason my doctor who wasn t the brightest gave me bowel movement pills 4 times a day they were also feeding me 3 times a day so it was a mess I dont even wanna think about it What I do now is i eat once a day I try to always cook myself and I make sure I eat berries and some fruits to help with movement This way I kinda have my bowel under control there s never too much food in me my energy level is super high with this diet since my body doesnt have to constantly digest food and also i sleep better First month is tough because you might feel hungry all the time but afterwards you just get hungry before you first and only meal This might also help to keep your weight in check With bladder do IC usually when I leak it s because of uti so I start drinking a lot of water and see if it stops if not my doctor prescribes antibiotics that I would usually take for 3 7 days That s last resort though research on weather constant use of antibiotics can cause more complex bacteria in the future is not very clear yet Overall drinking water is very very important and if your current bladder program not accommodating maybe some other solution might work I was visited by this guy back in rehab who switch to leg bags he would just drink whatever he wanted and just empty his leg bag once it was full I wouldnt do that myself but again we all deal with this stuff differently Maybe s ok me of the things I do seem dumb or counterproductive but just wanted to share what worked for me I m still figuring stuff out  I ve had many episodes of falling back after positive gains but I m finding they are short lived in comparison to what I m gaining in the long run That being said I m constantly diagnosing what s happening with my body You mentioned coffee and I used to live it I d make fun of guys at work that had to hit the restroom right after coffee because it cleaned them out But now I m that guy so no more coffee for me I too quit most of my meds cause I wasn t seeing anything positive out of them and am hanging onto those that work So it s okay to rant and this was my little rant cause I know how frustrated I get when everything is fouled up or I m have crazy painful spasms or feel like I ve lost some strength So reach out to this sub when you re like that and or need advice Take care  It is completely normal to have these struggles SCI is a long term journey and there are going to be times where it gets complex and times when it is smooth sailing   My biggest suggestion is to seek out a rehabilitation nurse to help sort through some of these things because there is so much going on it sounds like you are trying all the major options but it is definitely a good idea to try to get off the bladder meds as they almost all cause constipation I get a ton of bladder spasms without the botox and I d suggest you talk with your physiatrist about bladder augmentation or bladder implants that sort of thing There are some really interesting new options out there right now  I m four years out from my injury incomplete L1 There are many ups and downs on this journey as you well know Something that has helped me manage my irritation and frustration with things has been seeing a rehabilitation psychologist who specializes in working with people with traumatic injuries Honestly the ups and downs are still there and it s a constant change but therapy has really helped me to manage my emotions and to not let my pain and irritation and lifestyle changes get the best of me because it is beyond frustrating at times If you re already doing that then great But if you haven t tried seeing a rehab psychologist I think it could be very beneficial to you Hope you re feeling somewhat better  With goodrx it s still  400 a month and insurance keeps saying it s completely excluded from my plan and refuses to do anything They won t even work an appeal for me because I ve used to manyI couldn t agree with you more The Baclofen pump has been life changing The newer pumps are supposed to last between 6 7 years for battery life I ve been considering a baclofen pump for awhile now but have held off bc I m concerned it ll wipe out the little strength I have  I m C5 incomplete  Thereby continuing to make things hard just due to muscle weakness instead of significant spasticity Any thoughts based on your experience That s interesting to hear I tend to eat one main meal of the day with many berries fruit and have the same experience Although I do eat snacks throughout the day My weight is very stable Could actually do with more but I find eating more stresses out my system too much and still doesn t help me put on weight The other thing that makes a world of difference is drinking frequently and a lot Oh yeah I stopped all pain meds and nerve meds for the same reason My bowel is usually good but changing meds a lot makes things difficult I m on a permanent maintenence antibiotic because after I got cdiff the utis wouldn t go away but have stopped now I think my bladder issues are more spasm related but why the spasms are getting worse i don t know Participants Needed for Adaptive Gaming Study Paid Study in Philadelphia for Individuals that Self Catheterize to Empty their BladderSkin painI have this burning and crawling pain on the side of my leg where it transitions from no feeling to normal feeling If I wear spanx the pain is gone and touching it isn t painful anymore I think it s the constant pressure that relieves it and tricks my brain into ignoring it No guarantees but maybe something similar will help you  I have a similar issue with the left quad It s sensitive and the the level of sensitivity varies I   a guy  wear runners leggings and feel like that constant contact the material helps reduce the sensitivity I also sometimes use a dry wash cloth to rub on it and it seems to help temporarily  Does this pain happen above the injury or only below   What does this pain feel like Do you have sensation below your injury   Who told you that it is nerve pain Why didn t they give you advice on what maybe taken to relieve the pain   Gabapentin was what I was given when nerve pain was a problem But talk to your doctor about it and see if it is suitable for you You can t just go cold turkey in gabapentin  One thing I find helps a little can be if you have some moisturiser rubbed into your skin One of the things we suffer from is dry skin and it s the messages going to the brain can be misinterpreted because of the SCI Other solutions can be drugs for neurological pain There are lots of them and none really good for you as they act on your nervous system basically in your brain chemistry Apologies in advance for the spelling   Amitryptaline Gabapentin pregabalin Duloxetine and many others Usually these drugs are used in larger doses to treat mental disorders like depression etc  My legs have been  numb  since my first surgery to address issues surrounding my congenital spinal stenosis I was told this was nerve damage I have what I call  patches  from my waist down that come and go Sometimes these areas of skin a super sensitive to the least little touch even if I touch myself Ticklish I think this goes along with my hypersensitive reflexes Sometimes these  patches  just turn on by themselves and it s like it s tingling with electricity Almost an itch but not quite   I ve had all sorts of weird things happen that have been written off as nerve pain Touched on one leg and felt on the other It wasn t until I found a doctor that specialized in failed back surgery that I actually got some real answers I m not sure where you re located but I d be glad to pass along the name of the doctor that finally helped me if you re interested Just PM me and I ll pass along the info  I sometimes use icy hot in the region that I get nerve pain I get stabbing near the area of my transition line at random and icy hot tends to help My psychologist also taught me about pain meditation where I distract my mind or focus on something to help alleviate the pain Hope these tips help  I took diclofenac and paracetamol daily for nerve pain and cramping seemed to be the only thing that really helped  caffeine seemed to help a little bit too oddly enough  But I was really paranoid about taking too much for too long the possible effects of an overdose or chronic overuse are quite horrific  Both magnesium and b complex have been helpful to me in overall lessening and relieving nerve pain  Hot pepper cream has been pretty amazing in terms of quick relief    I have found topical CBD  not hemp derived but from a very low THC strain  to be a great help with those sudden bad patches it s great for just prevention makes my skin feel totally normal no nerve pain at all but it s hard to find get  and legal where I live  so it s kind of a last resort  The standard first line treatments for neuropathic pain are gabapentin a tricyclic antidepressant like amitriptyline or nortriptyline TENS capsaicin cream  made from oil of hot peppers  clonidine  a blood pressure medication used off label for pain  and acupuncture with electrostimulation Hypnosis CBT and other forms of sleep and psychological therapies can also be helpful Next line treatments include opioid meds like Tramadol hydromorphone Topamax  an atypical antipsychotic  and methadone   all have side effects or addiction potential and opioid prescription is difficult pretty much everywhere now since the opioid crisis Once you ve tried pretty much everything if it hasn t helped they consider surgical options which could include rhizotomy  splitting of nerve roots that feed the areas that most contribute to pain  DREZ surgery  surgery that cuts away part of the spinal cord where the nerve tracts related to areas of pain are  or an intrathecal pump implant or neurostimulator These are implanted devices used to manage pain and have a computer and small battery pack around the size of a hockey puck and are connected by a small tube or wire lead to your spinal cord at the level where the pain is being caused by I have an intrathecal pump and it s worked really well for me because it has anesthetic in it that has managed to silence most of the pain I was experiencing in my legs butt back knee and foot Here s a great plain language summary of research evidence on pain after SCI just in case you are interested  https   scireproject com community topic pain   https   scireproject com community topic pain   It s below the injury Arms trunk and legs it just feels raw and very sensitive to anything that touches it I ve been taking gabapentin 3x day since the injury but the pain persists Thanks for reaching out  It s on my entire left arm it feels like an itchy blistering rash but nothing is there if my hair brushes against it it hurts immensely I m taking gabapentin but even maxing out my dose nothing helps painkillers also don t touch the pain for me but I ve heard some use Valium or Xanax I m not endorsing the idea just seen it mentioned for nerve pain I don t know why it works but can t ask my doctor about it for me bc I can t stop my pain medication right now and they won t let me take both  Thanks same for me with pain in my left thigh and knee I used to wear pantyhose or compression leggings and It would prevent my hair follicles from moving which was EXQUISITELY painful I do use moisturizer but find no difference But thank you for responding Will do Thanks  I thought meditation would help But I have trouble clearing my mind The pain keeps creeping in I ve had some meditation training I may have to look into it more as the drugs are scary Thank you for your reply Never had those mentioned before ThanksThank you so much Wow Thanks for all that Definitely sounds like nerve pain Have you spoken to your specialist  if you have one  or general practitioner  if not  Morphine works for it as well but can become addictive some people swear by CBD oil as well  didn t work for me  and making sure you re offloading pressure from those regions as much as practically reasonable should help Have you tried other medications for nerve pain I have similar  although less severe  allodynia as well I was also initially taking gabapentin but switched over to pregabalin and I found it helps me a lot more Power chair advice Praying for your father I hope he has a smooth recovery Now when it comes to power chairs the main thing you want is a recliner option so your dad doesn t get pressure sores Sitting high option is cool if your insurance covers it if not it s really not necessary Really hope your dad stays strong and continue to push him through physical therapy  I m C5 and the seat elevator is a necessity for me because it helps me get my seat level with my bed so I can transfer myself Without that I wouldn t even be able to help others with the transfer and I would need to use a lift There s also the benefit of being able to reach more things as a result of elevation And the fact that in crowded places like bars being that low to the ground is awful and makes it impossible to navigate   As others have mentioned make sure it can recline as pressure sores are a huge issue for SCIs and that will assists in keeping those away I personally have used permobil chairs and those have worked fine for me  Okay I ll need to talk to the pt to see if he thinks my dad would benefit I don t think his good arm is going to be able to pick up too much but you never know The crowd thing is good to know Thanks for helping  My husband has a seat elevator  he s about a C6 incomplete and in his 30s  It has been handy for him to reach some things up high or even raise his chair a little for transfers or to help him stand up with the walker   It cost about  2000 out of pocket  it s not covered by insurance  Personally my husband would probably be ok without it now that he s stronger and has remained more movement but it was very useful for the first year or two   My recommendation make sure your dad s loaner chair is configured for him to drive with his worse hand if possible It ll help him gain more movement in that hand and free up his better hand for other tasks  My husband was driving with his good hand for a while which neglected his bad hand and definitely didn t help any recovery   Good on you I am a C2   C6 level injury although much younger than your father It will give him a lot of much needed independence   I personally use Sunrise Mobility Q700 Talk to your doctor to recommend someone to customize the chair I use a Roho back and cushion which in my experience are excellent You would also want the customization for back reclining tilting leg raise It looks really nice in modern and is comfortable for many hours Absolutely love it and would chose it again in a heartbeat   I have also seen the Permobil and Quantum  I do not remember which models  although they are good not as good as the Q700   This is purely based on my personal experience I was really careful when choosing one and had been using a manual chair prior to this Confident that he will like it  Thank you  Good to know He has the best attitude and we know we are very blessed that he is still here This reminds me of another benefit of the seat elevator   Standard tables are often to short for my husband s legs to fit underneath when he s in his power chair  he s about 6 3  and 280lbs  but the seat elevator allows him to get tall enough to fit perfectly at a bar height table Maybe that seat elevator isn t a good option for him then because he won t be doing any standing or transfers without a sling That is a great idea about his bad hand Thanks for sharing Thank you so much for the specifics  Leg raising is a feature no one has mentioned I will look into that back and cushion Take care Anyone else have trouble sitting up straight Yes I struggle with it too C5 35 years post injury My physical therapist has pushed me to use a chest strap or shoulder harness I hate the idea but the more reading writing and  looking down  work I do makes the struggle worse I am a  hooker  too I hook my arm on my canes always have The more I read the more my neck aches During the quarantine I have been unable to see my physical therapist Having her work on my neck every two weeks made a huge difference I found it vital to find a PT who is knowledgeable and listens to these issues Golden  What kind of back do you have on your wheelchair A lot of quads have tension backs and they are really bad for encouraging slumping  I have this issue as well  C2 C5 6 incomplete  though I m relatively new to this so have yet to figure out some sort of hack My posture is generally pretty bad as well which screws with my shoulders neck and lower back so much  95  of my day is spent tilted back and reclined in my wheelchair Broke my neck in 1991 I have pretty bad scoliosis Sitting up in my chair causes me to lean on my left elbow  You could have scoliosis or a kyphosis  exaggerated curve of your upper back neck like a hunch  It can be caused by bad seating   seat angle and backrest setup   and also by muscle imbalances in your shoulders back and chest You should definitely see a physiotherapist about it first who knows about SCI and wheelchair users and go from there  I also suffer from this as well 10 years post injury Like another poster I used to hook my arms behind to the push handles to give me more stability but actually Lost my wrist extension on one side due to nerve damage on the inside of my bicep Fortunately this returned after about four months after doing some nerve tests at a local hospital So I wouldn t recommend that at all I would recommend a chest strap as high up as possible and try and loosen it to give yourself some flexibility and training in leaning back There are many shoulder straps you can use designed to give people better posture usually available quite cheaply on Amazon You can wear one of these for half a day and I found that helped Also if I spent three days in bed I would find my back would reset it self so this is likely from leaning forwards too often Down at a phone  Computer And the other thing that can help is pulling your knees forwards to recline yourself a little bit more but this can put dangerous amounts of pressure on the ischial areas and generate pressure sores So rest good discipline and straps can help  I use a roho agility back but the worse this gets the more I m thinking it s not angled correctlyThanks This is pretty cool I ve been using a wheelchair for 20 years and this actually doesn t look that helpful it s not that last 10 feet a hard packed sand but the first 200 yards of soft sand that s hard to get across and anybody who s using a chair every day would never dare take it in the salt water plus that metal railing itself is going to fall apart in no time what s really useful is the rollout mats that you see in places like La Jolla beach hopefully they start to show up everywhere Dude looks like he just climbed in the chair for the photo opp just saying Makes my heart smile It s very nice I have to use a beach wheelchair or get a friend to carry me  we have one of those in my city   it s a paved ramp with a hand rail on it going into the water The advantage for wheelchair users is you can wheel all the way up to the water s edge and transfer in if you want to swim There s also a beach wheelchair available that s designed to be wheeled into the water The handrail is really helpful for transferring and for ambulatory people to hang on to when getting across the beach to the water We also use the ramp as a launch spot for kayaking on the lake because you can place the kayak on the ramp and wheel alongside it so there s a level transfer and you don t have to wheel on the sand to get to it  It s hard not considering myself a husk of what I used to be before my accident You re still awesome I know what you mean   23 years post injury and the pervasive presence of disability is challenging Coming up one year for me in a few days   I know what you mean  It is a constant battle for me Reminders of what you thought your life was going to be like smack you in the face randomly and then the mind starts effing with you I hope you have someone to vent to cause it helps Stay up  You are alive period That s the first hurdle  Same for me but I can enjoy thinking about the good times And then tell myself to stop dwelling on the past and look at what s next I doubt it will ever go away well it certainly improved  my life was pretty great before now I get treated like I have the mental capabilities of a toddler while I m stuck in a body of a 90 year old  First Episode of Off The Crutch PodcastSubscribed  Thanks Boner questionAlprostadil injections 4  hour erections that led to 3am emergency rushes to the hospital because it had been 5 hours   the drive took the edge off hahahahaha  Have you tried ball loops and things mate They can help the blood stay up there   Other than that I don t know I use a cock sleeve to stay hard and at some point will be having an erectile implant put in   www SCIsexualhealth ca  https   www SCIsexualhealth ca     There s a whole section on this under male fertility  That s ridiculous lol and I m glad that you are doing well hahaDrug trialsHey there I ve had a fair amount of tethering myself drug trials and regeneration research tends to be focused on people with very new injuries as the theory goes the recently damaged nerves are more likely to be able to regrow and less scar has formed This isn t the case for people with chronic non traumatic issues like Spina Bifida and tethered cord The same principles apply to many other forms of neurological injury   the earlier you get to surgery to correct the problem the better The research on tethering is that there is negligible benefit to detethering surgeries after growth has stopped  ie after adolescence  The good news is that you re unlikely to retether more in adulthood the bad news is that there is very little research on this topic It s very likely that the frontiers of research being explored right now for spinal cord injury  electrical stimulation stem cell therapies  will one day be applied to other forms of neurological injury like tethering since they work on underlying principles of the nervous system  however that s a long way off  I have a traumatic sci  as an adult   I had tethering had surgery things went very well  I regained some function and sensation spasticity and nerve pain diminished  and I have had no recurrence  I am also not on blood thinners and have no congenital clotting disorders which are both things that  anecdotally  seem to be linked to recurrent post traumatic tethering    I have an acquaintance with chiari who has multiple clotting disorders and no one will operate on the chiari because the risk of tethering is so great and the damage would be so high  Interesting I ve never heard about the relation to clotting  Seems unacceptable to be zero treatment   How long did it take you to regain any of that I actually lost more from the surgery than I did from the tetheringCT Scan ImagesInsurance with changing jobsEach state and company are different You should probably contact the HR department of each job to see what your options are  do you still have Medicaid or Medicare I ask because I started working  No I ve been on my employer Healthcare since my injury so I m worried about gaps in coverage if I do change jobsDid you lose Medicaid after you started working The 1619b provision will allow you to keep your Medi Caid if you need it to continue working and your income is not enough to cover your medical needs and it will allow you to earn higher income than the poverty based Medi Caid that was linked to your SSI  the income limits differ state by state but the threshold is usually at least twice what the lower income category allows  provided that you are still determined medically disabled There is usually also another category of Medi Caid for people with disabilities where you will pay a small sliding scale premium based on income and also requires that you be employed and need to maintain the Medi Caid coverage to continue working  Thanks Elon Musks  NeuraLink  hopes to treat spinalcordInjuries and other disabilities August 28 they re giving an update on their tech  I hope Elon proves me completely wrong But    Bullshit He s essentially the tech version of a preacher claiming miracles at this point   There s plenty to be done for people with brain spinal injuries TODAY that are not miracle moonshots   He could use his billions to fund research for a new wheelchair as a stopgap for these people Or fund a model rehabilitation facility  or five  across the world  there are a shitload of places dedicated to advancing wheelchairs there is not that level of support for something like Tesla s described if it doesn t work out then it doesn t but some of us would like to be able to use our hands again someday if not walk again thanks for the downvote dude Fuck Elon Musk lol That s the same non solution attitude that s keeping people with SCI from getting any further treatment after they ve left rehab He could use his billions to fund research for a new wheelchair as a stopgap for these people    If I had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses    Henry Ford  Musk is an asshole but he s an asshole that has successfully privatized spaceflight as well as aggressively pushed markets forward in electric vehicles and solar power  plus personal flame throwers lol  If anybody can lead the charge on this it s him  that are not miracle moonshots   It s not that far out  https   youtu be OWNZ5axNadk  Biggest constraint right now is creating a BCI that is portable enough to be used in daily life outside the lab unlike something like the Utah array  which is exactly what they are working on fund research for a new wheelchair why would he and what kind of wheelchair are you even talking about this is a weird whataboutismOne Beast effort for the week Hope this find you all well and pushing forward with me Thank you for inspiring me Stairs sleds what next Lets see together Keep pushing brother I have a much milder spinal cord injury but it still gets me down Seeing people like you and others pushing through even worst situations then myself gives me inspiration I truly mean this  Wow  I love it  You re doing good my man   if you don t mind me asking what was the injury  L1burst incomplete Broke several other bones including leg wrist clavicle and 7 ribs Caged my spine from 2 above to 1 below the L1  Thx Appreciate it  Cool I m using a walker at times Still using a wheelchair for long days outside I also have the toe offs My quads are doing nicely but it s taking time to build hammies and glutes  I m an L1 incomplete as well and just based off of this video our presentation looks really similar What mobility devices  if any  have you been using I generally use forearm crutches but I m starting to work towards using canes for shorter distances You look like you re crushing it dude If you ever want to chat or swap tips hit me up Dog training in a wheelchair Teaching my girl to come up on my lap in a controlled manner For anyone wondering why I d bother to train this it makes it way easier to get toys out of her mouth give her pets put her harness on clip leads on etc   This is awesome I m about to get a puppy in September Can t seem to find good resources for wheelchair puppy training Any hints  Is it going to be a big dog or small dog I m not gunna lie training a large dog from a wheelchair is not for the faint hearted The most important thing to get down is lead control If your dog can t walk without pulling then you re screwed from a chair user s perspective In a chair you can t brace like a person on 2 feet can if your dog sees a squirrel and pulls you ll end up on the floor   For walking I use a halty lead I clip one end around my waist  most secure part of me  and the other end to my pup s harness I trained her to always walk on the right side of my chair so she won t get tangled in the wheels I started by having my partner push me whilst I fed her treats for walking on a nice slack lead beside me Once she got the hang of that I started going out myself but accompanied I only started walking her alone once I was 100  sure she would not pull   Oh and definitely consider getting a freewheel or rgk front wheel It s great for the dog park   Other than that I d say crack down on any behaviour you don t like quickly It s was easier to teach good behaviour than it is to unteach bad Also check out  it s me or the dog   all episodes on YouTube  it s a great show and has awesome training tips from problem behaviours Looking for some prespectiveI have the same pins and needles in the same places However I find them quite uncomfortable and I ve always been told that this is neuropathic nerve pain It gets stronger usually if there is something wrong and I take Lyrica on the highest dose to try and Control it However it doesn t seem to help much If anyone else has some solutions I d love to hear it as well  I was told that with more movement that I may get more nerve pain I mainly use desensitizing techniques to lessen it  ice heat and taking a textured clothe to the areas  I was told for fiery nerve pain specifically elavil is best I took it for while and it helped a lot even at low dosage and eventually I stopped when my nerves finally calmed down a bit   I m still pretty new in my injury as well so I m not that experienced but these are what helped me  Unfortunately it feels like a lot of medical professionals only know general information about SCI s I still get nerve pain but it s a lot more tolerable now I use to not be able to lay on my side because I felt like it was burning It s so different for everybody though so it may take a lot of experimentation to figure out what helps Good luck and I hope the best for you  I hoping I can add a little here Firstly everyone of course is different That being said we ve all had some very similar pain spasm experience I had no nerve pain or spasms until about 7 8 months Then bam Right quad with the burning muscle cramp and pain  L1 burst incomplete  They started after my PT increased and I started using 4AP  4 aminopyridine  Doc told me it was a good thing as the nerves we re trying to reconnect I was feeling like the sense of feeling was moving  albeit slowly farther down my leg but man do the contractions and pain kick my ass The more I d workout the more they would intensify which makes sense to me I sometimes think I was told it was a good thing to keep my mind off it But I m constantly diagnosing things that contribute to these events like sugary drinks spicy food UTI or intensive workouts and hydration But just when I think I got it nailed it changes The desensitizing helps at times but I m terrible at keeping it up on a regular basis Just stay with it PT is definitely our new job Use and improve or lose it  You re still very early in your injury so anything is possible Personally I recovered a lot of movement but very little sensation If at all  I m L1 incomplete  I m walking with a clever lite right now and can do longer distances  not extremely long yet  No two SCIs are the same keep working those muscles though if you see yourself recovering Even if you feel like it s moving but it s not keep trying  I declined lyrica at about a month into my injury because I felt it wasn t helping anyway and I didn t want anything to affect the communication between my upper body and lower body I figured if it was numbing pain it was also interrupting signals potentially Just my take    Thanks for sharing Very interesting indeed   Where I am located despite my asking of different professionals very little if anything has been shared about nerve pain or what to expect with it Thank you This helps more than you can know Thanks Very interesting that s what the doctor told you I also find it very interesting that your feeling was that the  sense of feeling  was slowing moving down your leg I have gained skin sensitivity well below the navel when originally I couldn t feel a touch even an inch or so above my navel when the injury occured   As you said everyone is different yet similarities are there as well I m T12 Complete 11 months post injury and I still don t get any spasticity No cramps yet either and hope it stays that way   I ve watched the stairs video you posted and it s amazing Your efforts are paying off Thank you It s great to hear your perspective Congrats on gaining such great movement thus far Keep at it  I  and others I m sure  gain a lot of inspiration from such experiences as yours as well as similar experiences of others here   I ll keep at it of course I m trying to be very much in touch with my body and paying careful attention to whatever I feel including new sensations or movements as well as keeping a record of how older movements and sensations are holding up over time Any little gain is motivating and quite encouraging My SCI happened when I was pregnant here is me right before I gave birth My baby just turned 1m old today The birth was extremely difficult but I didn t need a c section L5 S1 incompleteTalk about brave and string Your the poster child for those  Love this   Congrats mother I m a T5 complete Is it bad to not want to explain it when people ask why you re in a wheelchair First of all you don t have to explain anything It s something very personal to you and strangers don t have the right to hear about your personal story Would you expect someone to reply to a question about how they lost their virginity Of course not That s how personal this question can be If people don t understand that fuck em   Now some advice how to deal with this question for yourself I have different  scripts  for different situations and different kinds of people The short version is just  I had an accident  It answers the question and if they ask more I can tell them politely that I don t want to talk about it If I don t want to talk about it but they re nice people I will say something like   I had an accident ten years ago and it was pretty bad but now I m doing pretty well It s a pretty long story and I ve told it a lot so it s just a bit of a  boring conversation When I know people better I will tell them the specifics of the accident and my rehabilitation journey but also how I dealt with it and how it made me grow Usually I will then end it with asking them a specific question about their life In that way it doesn t become a story about how I became disabled but an  exchange  of important things that happened in both of our lives   In all these situations it is important for you to know that  I control  the conversation It is  my life  so I don t talk about things I don t want to talk about When I say  I had an accident  people always assume that I had a car accident If I don t want the conversation to continue in this path I won t correct them even if it is not true If you answer with a short answer they should pick up the hint that you don t want to talk about it If they then continue to ask they are making the faux pas   Hope my perspective on this can help you in the future  Tbh I just base it on what I want to explain at the time Sometime they get the full  Oh I fell snowboarding in 2015 and broke my neck damaged my spinal cord and then inflammation didn t go away and that led to another lesion  and diagnosis of inactive MS  in 2019 making me an incomplete C2 C5 6 quadriplegic  and other times they get the    can t walk    It s not really their business most of the time so whether or not I give a good explanation is kinda my decision  My boyfriend usually says something along the lines of  laser tag accident  or  hot dog eating competition  We watch them try to process the information and laugh about it later   Took him 2 years to tell me and that s okay it was a traumatic experience and traumatic experiences aren t exactly small talk or first date conversations You have no reason to explain just to settle someone s passing curiosity  Different story based on situation is my take too Based on the person I am conversing with I decide which story to tell And no I don t tell the same story to everyone This also makes people aware that Spinal cord injury can have variety of causes  a fall be it from 1st floor or from a branch 6 feet above the ground a wrong slip in the bathroom road traffic accident a wrong dive into the pool When I was part of peer counseling team I heard loads of stories And I re use some of them Closer the person is true the story is   In my country I have strangers starting from Uber driver to some random person in club coming up to me and asking me about why I am on wheelchair and telling I will walk again soon I am no longer bothered with walking part But I do tell different stories sometimes to instil fear   horror and some times for fun They d even get personal Am I married do I have kids And life must be tough and bla bla But like I said based on how the conversation starts my story develops   This also keeps me entertained    You are not obligated to respond to this personal query but it s better to come in terms and start enjoying the reaction on listener s face Especially if you some how end up making the story relatable to his life too you get to shake his sanity for a few hrs I know super evil But why not  You re not obligated to tell anyone anything about your injury And if they re a complete stranger just don t acknowledge it Telling the sotry of  what happened   or  what s wrong withyou   gets very old very quick I just move right past the question  I had this happen kind of early on at a wedding reception A guest whom I had never met before came up and said that her little girl who appeared about seven years old m had a question and if it was OK I said  sure   The little girl asked politely why I was in a wheelchair I said matter of factly  because I can t walk   It was fun watching her process the information as if that should ve been enough  in a  but I already knew that  kind of way  and whether or not she should ask a followup question I was hoping for a little sass back   squinty eyed hands on hips Didn t get any Thankyou I did find this very helpfulIt makes me feel better to know other people  dumb it down  so to speak Thanks for this Before I got all my car adaptions set up I used ubers for a long time They were awful for it Always asked me what happened or if it was  perminant  Had a few suggest herbal or mystic healing things too hah Since we re posting xrays  L2 incomplete paraplegicWhat is that bright white thing A bullet He got shot twiceIt s best not to land on the bottom of 3 people off a deck  damnn that s some serious hardware how are you doing  I can walk but am in constant pain Bowel and bladder Good days and bad Apparently were posting our x rays WOW   I m glad mine aren t in my neck excuse me I need to go clear my throat  Well I ve had two surgeries One right when it happened and one back in 2018 Both times o couldn t eat solid food for about two weeks Anyone get a SCI frOm a medical procedure My dad did actually Back when open heart surgery was the normal way to do a bypass they crushed several of the vertebrae in his neck and told him for months that all of his pain was normal He finally got a doc to listen they did an MRI and low and behold he had major damage   Because of his heart surgery they couldn t replace it with bone from his hip so they got it from the bone bank  which I didn t know was a thing  He had pretty significant issues with his left arm as a result for the rest of his life   Sorry this happened to you hopefully they can figure it out  Yup   Had a selective dorsal rhizotomy with laminectomies all the way down from L1 S2 at the age of 4   Diagnosed with Adhesive Arachnoiditis all over the site at 27   Btw if you haven t been checked out for arachnoiditis you really should be with a history and symptom set like that They sadly sound very familiar to me  When they saw the MRI it still took them six months to figure out what it was   They told me only 79 other people in the world have ever had a Thoracic tethered cord T2 T7 Hundreds of punctures through both myelin sheaths with a partial sever where it was folded in half Four inches of my cord eviscerated   They said I was the only one known to ever have endured the tether for over 34 years Every other known case had it untethered immediately following their accidents   The tether got worse every year I was shamed shunned and beaten throughout childhood because everyone thought my pain episodes and flashes of paralysis for sheer attention seeking   Doctors insisted it could not have been done simply at the hands of abusive caregivers nor was it a birth defect   I am told it was done to me on purpose as part of a government experiment I have no proof of that just a lot of dots to connect Just excruciating pain every day to remind me there is no answer or relief  May I ask if the symptoms are getting any better  Hey I am sorry about your dad Sounds like he had  a rough time I never realized how many people are unfortunate victims of medical errors until this happened I appreciate it though Yep I have been checked for that and even did IV Steroids to stop any potential clumping I even sent my MRI to Dr Tennant   I am sorry to hear you have AA It s a scary and tough diagnosis Can ask about your symptom onset and progression I had a tethered spinal cord at T1 as an adult due to complications from a failed spinal fusion for kyphosis It took a decade for someone to figure out what was triggering arachnoid cysts to form at T8 and why I was slowly losing the ability to walk   There was no government conspiracy or whatever just bad luck It would be easier to think there was a reason these things happened to me but sometimes bad things happen at random and it sucks but that s all it is Unfortunately not at allIt looks like this is pretty uncommon from other posts but my surgeon came in through my side to install this  cage  to prevent my vertebrae from collapsing into my L1 burst fracture T11 L3 fusion Got the same exact fusion and injury as you Cage and all PM me bro C2 T1 decompression and fusion You can see broken screws at the bottom Ouch  Can you bend your head or us it stuck in me position  This was done ten years ago this past June I can t look up but I can kinda look down I can turn about 30 degrees in each direction It s been so long I can t remember what it s like to be loose I m always stiff and sore   Here s a side view     side view  http   imgur com a IS25yJz Actually these pics are from 2010 where they stopped at C3 I had to go back a year later to get C2 taken care of and while they were in there they shaved down the broken screws and confirmed that the C7 T1 was able to fuse Looking down would still compress my cord so they wanted to open it on   Also had 2 lumbar surgeries but no metal Might as well join the party L1 T9 fusion for T11 burstMy x ray is weak but I made up for it with my jawYoi Were you wired shut for a while  Surprising no they did not have too Just on soft  mush  foods for 6 weeks They could not set it for the first 5 days after they did the spine just to make sure that was all sweet first so had it like that for about 6 days before they fixed it My  66  Dad Recently Suffered an Incomplete SCI C3 C6 FusedIt is pretty common to have hospital induced Demetia if you re older Make sure they check for a UTI  No easy solutions  Thanks The first thing we thought was UTI because my Babcia used to get completely disoriented when she had one So far all physical causes are ruled out and they think he may be collapsing under the stress of the gravity of the situation Hopefully the right blend of meds can get him back to himself and lucid Sharing photos Here s mine Pre surgery Tethered Thoracic Cord That s 4 inches of cord trapped between vertebrae I am hurt that no one responded to my post when everyone else was acknowledged I d hoped this was a place to feel included after a lifetime of my SCI isolating me I ve posted comments here and no one responds It just hurts to be invisible to the one group I shouldn t have to feel alienated by  How did the surgery go  My mistake I thought you Posted this right before the operation    I guess that wouldn t make total sense during a pandemic depending on where you are   Chronic pain is difficult it definitely is hard to find a lot of balance in life   like what you can put your body through on a daily bases to still get out and enjoy life   and not being too dependent on one substance so it still does the trick years later   I truly hope you ve found a good life balance with your chronic pain      I hope you live in Canada so you can always try out new types of marijuana    I can t do that that stuff makes me paranoid  O Biggest mistake of my life Thanks for asking My state is legal   I d be lost without my THC oil I guess we re sharing our x rays My SCI Osteomyelitis infection to the left SCI to the right Its not supposed to bend like that is it   The white line is the spinal cord The disc between my vertebrae damaged it by smashing it The Osteomyelitis is a bone tissue eating infection that caused all this damageMy submission to X Ray Show and TellHappy cake day  Thank you  Tips with spasms I would consider taking to your doc about a baclofen pump It s done wonders for me and I ll answer any questions you might have I couldn t lay flat or drive over a small bump without kicking wildly I just kept upping my baclofen dose until I was taking 180mg a day and it still wasn t helping I opted for the pump and it s been a lifesaver How much baclofen do you take  What meds are you on  Are your spasms painful  I don t have the normal everyday spasms I ve seen with other SCI s Mine are more muscle contraction and pain no shaking And I only get them in my left quad I would like to know if anyone else is dealing with this I take Gabapentin regularly now I have Baclofen sometimes at night before bed Stopped taking Tizanidine cause it made me sleepy Sorry I don t have any help for your question  Meds didn t work for me  I won t take benzodiazepines don t tolerate baclofen and tizanidine was 3 years down a hole of drowsy floppy misery    My spasms are managed by exercise   I use an estim bike and a number of different estim devices  empi intelect chatanooga compex   all brands made by the same company donjoy  with varying levels of programs and versatility  Stimulating the nerves and muscles has eliminated both sorts of spasticity  the rigidity and the rapid twitching ticcing  and is also weirdly really good for my mood   CBD is really dependent on the rest of the cannabinoids to metabolize and be effective  Most commercial cbd in the US is hemp derived so the levels of other cannabinoids are minuscule meaning it takes much much more and it s expensive  I have had significant success with topical cbd from low thc strains  I live in a state where it s legal but my employer requires random negative tests so can t risk oral anything  which is still challenging to track down unless you re growing your own and then it needs extracted etc  I take about 180MG also Im at the maximum dose and then i take three x a day dantreleen Baclofen and Dantreen I sometimes take a flexoril at

the UK has a pretty good guide to taking care of your skin      https   www spinal co uk wp content uploads 2015 08 Skin  https   www spinal co uk wp content uploads 2015 08 Skin  I currently have almost the same issue Although I ve been injured a lot longer and I m currently on bed rest at home getting up once or twice a week so I don t lose too much muscle mass or movement for mental health Everything is healing steadily after six weeks about 30  healed I typically stay up for 16 hours a day and will have to increase pressure relief in the future and take more rest The cushion needs to be assessed by a pressure clinic  I had a pretty bad sore on my hip butt cheek a few years ago likely started from a zit that got infected Not nearly as bad as yours but it took about 6 months to a year to fully heal For many of us it s tough to see the back of us and because of this it s our responsibility to voice to those helping us the importance of communication of issues that even seem minor   I was not on full bed rest but I spent a lot more time in bed I also sleep and lay in bed on my stomach To deal with mine I d spend the first few hours of my day about 3 hours out of bed This included my routine of stretching BM and eating I d then get back in bed for 4 5 hours on my stomach Back in my chair for a couple hours in the evening maybe 3ish hours to eat do whatever then back in bed for the night The time in my chair I d try to do almost excessive pressure relief   It took some time but this worked for me I saw a wound care specialist at a local hospital once a week for a few months early on I cleaned the wound and put new dressings on it 2 3 times a week don t use hydrogen peroxide or harsh cleaners I was told to use regular hand soap water   I am by no means suggesting to ignore doctors or say every one of them lacks experience That being said I often feel many GPs don t deal with quads on a regular and you should consider asking for a specialist referral if you feel it s relevant   Best of luck being in bed all day isn t ideal but pressure sores are a long term heal for many of us with sitting and poor circulation  http   www thespinalfoundation org skin care best practices  this is the standard guideline that we follow in India Many peer trainers  peer mentors use this as guidelines for skin care approach This should be something you should be adopting into your daily life   Grade 3 ulcers  to start with stop any sittings follow the log rolling position change rule every 2 hrs Never lie supine always prone on your stomach At least until the sore heals Leave the sore area aerated preferably covered with just a cloth I know for lower grade ulcers and what we need to do I had grade 1 ulcers a couple of times I stopped sitting except for my bowel program And in 14 days it healed I used to clean the ulcer with saline water But for grade 3 i dont know Let me check and get back I will share what we recommend in India And you can follow something similar If it is something that you can adopt   Skin care routine day in day out check with a mirror or at least thrice a week check the buttocks area near the balls lower spine under thigh for skin condition Use coconut oil or body lotion I use vaseline body lotion and amply apply in these areas where pressure sore is more likely i e Buttocks and under thigh Strictly follow the push up policy every 20 or 30 mins while sitting on wheelchair By push up I mean hold my wheels and lift my body for 15 20 seconds Of course I am a a paraplegic My friend who is a quad I think c5 c6 he relieves the pressure by moving sideways  as much as he can  He also uses a cushion to sit and never sits on hard surfaces It s always some for of soft surface  Pushing through like a beast 3 years post injury L1 burst incomplete  other broken bones too  Just posting to show my progress and maybe inspire someone else to keep going Thanks to my wife I m never stopping Your form looks solid engaging those hip flexors and quads to move that leg up instead of swinging it around   Keep at it Your hard work is inspiring   cheers Hell yeah bud  Fuck some stairs up for me  Awesome job Keep on keeping on The moment we stop it s the moment we shut down  Awesome Congrats on the hard work and dedication I m hopefully going to start gait training soon when my quads are a little stronger Can t wait to put in the hard work like you  Fuck yeah man keep it going   Looking good  Heck yeah bro I remember going up my first set of stairs and my God it was pretty scary Cheers to pushing the limit   Nothing but respect man  Rock those weak a   stairs  Wooo  Fantastic progress dude   Well done  I remember after my kyphosis surgery a few years ago I couldn t walk for about a week and my right leg was completely numb and I could barely put any pressure on it After about 7 days in hospital I had to walk down some steps so I could get the blood moving in my leg I was shaking like leaf and I had to hold onto about 3 people and the banister but when I finally managed to walk down a few I started crying because after 7 days I was seeing progress Again well done sir    Excellent work Stairs are a beast   you should be proud   If I may ask are you wearing some sort of brace on your legs If so what kind and do they help mitigate spasms   I ask because my husband s biggest obstacle in walking again  besides getting the right prosthesis   lost his left leg when he was injured  is spasms in his  good  leg He got a good rhythm down on his first prosthetic leg but his right leg will spasm unpredictably and send him to the floor His physical therapist has basically said that s the only thing holding him back from progressing with walking  I have  toe off  carbon fiber braces on both legs They help walking as they essentially take the place of my calf muscles   as I understand it  They do not help with spasms other than the more I m up walking and exercising the less frequent they are Hope this helps  VERY good   What most people don t realize is that only some of the needed muscles are working other muscles are working but have limited function as only part of the muscle is receiving signals while others are getting the wrong signals It takes us at least 300  more energy to perform tasks like this than the average human I tell people to imagine that they are wearing a backpack with 200 or 300 lbs in it Not just for a few minutes until they get tired or it gets hard to do  all day  Exactly from a c4 5 incomplete who thankfully had a decent recovery keep it up this is amazing to see   Huge effort Amazing That s great T shirt Thx I thought so too Thanks so very much   Thx AgreedThat s a lot of steel in my back But life does get easier keep on pushing and working at life oooo that looks a lot like my back Did they also fuse you  Ah you beat me I only have 10 screws but I have a rather large bolt in my pelvis  T5 complete for life bro  fistbump  Paralysis  Nice Kinda looks like mine   Ouch Yes they did Yes T5 complete It could be yours Or anybody s Only one thing is certain   it ain t T5CompleteLiz s As long as we are posting our cool X rays check out this cool bridge I have now instead of my L1 non recoverable burst  Great I m an L1  3 years out  and walk a bit with a walker but building my hamstrings and glutes is taking forever The numbness and sensitivity I experienced took about 6 months to subside as the swelling around the surgery site and spinal cord went down Good luck  Wow crazy  How long ago  What s your current prognosis regarding paralysis and mobility  About 5 months ago now  By some sort of miracle I was off the walker by week 3 and I am fairly independently mobile right now  Still a lot of numbness and or pain from knees to nips but every day is a bit better Research Study on SCIMy late wife died from ALS in January 2010  I often thought about suicide after her death Our daughter was 12 when her mom  my wife and best friend  died  Knowing that I had a 12 year old daughter who lost her mother to ALS got me through 2010 to 2017 if I died our daughter would have lost both of her parents   My spinal cord injury took place inside a hospital in September 2017 I certainly contemplated suicide after I came home from 67 days in the hospital     I walked into the ER with a sharp pain in my right side They told me that I was constipated A higher power got me admitted to the hospital where I languished for five days unable to move my legs urinate on my own or have a poop on my own   On day 5 they tried to give me an MRI  There were major complications I pleaded for a CT Scan at around 1 AM  When the Radiologist read my CT he said  There is compression on the cord   That is like yelling  Fire  in a theatre I underwent an emergency six hour surgery on my vertebrae so that they could cut the bone closest to the skin on my back remove the bone  spinous process  and scrape out the pus  I had to have a second operation where they opened up the old operation and took off more bone in my lumbar region   A few days later I went into full cardiac arrest for 6 7 minutes  I suffered major brain damage from no oxygen to my brain for 6 7 minutes They got my heart started  They put a stent in the right coronary artery I was having seizures They put me into a coma and on life support for four days They installed a heart assist pump in my descending aorta to take some of the load off of my heart  When I woke up after four days on a ventilator I ripped the hoses going into me out of my body They tied my hands to the bed rail I pleaded with them to untie my hands They would not do that for some time   They sent me to an inpatient rehab hospital  At the rehab hospital I could not move my body to get out of bed  I fell out of my bed and a very loud bed alarm went off and all the nurses and staff came running into my room   Over time the rehab staff taught me how to transfer myself from my hospital bed to a wheelchair  I learned how to move out of the wheel chair onto a shower chair  They started to reteach me how to walk using a walker  They tested my aptitude and told me that I was in the 10th percentile  They said that my brain was so damaged that I would never be able to comprehend what had happened to me   When I got home I was in a wheel chair I was really depressed and thought often about the best way to kill myself  I did not want to shoot myself What if I missed   This happens    I decided a plastic bag over my head with a tank of helium going through a hose into the inside of my plastic bag was the best route  I had a tank of helium in my work shed   I ditched the wheelchair and bought the tallest walker I could buy  It is called a Rollator   I will have to insert a catheter to pee each time I need to drain my bladder for the rest of my life I will use enemas for the rest of my life to take a poop  I flush water up my anus to help the feces come out   My spinal cord injury cut off the blood supply to my urogenital nerves I could have sex the night before I walked into the ER  My SCI caused me to become impotent   After I got home from the hospital I used to look at a particular light in our house and think about the best way of killing myself  What kept me from killing myself was the fact that our daughter was now 19 and she still needed a dad   I relearned how to walk and graduated from the Rollator to a cane I fall occasionally I have relearned how to drive a car   I am 68 I still work full time  I met a nice lady on Match in 2012 two years after my wife s death from ALS  What keeps me going  What keeps me going The fact that my heart stopped for 6 7 minutes made me think that I must have a purpose in life   What keeps me from contemplating suicide anymore  The reasons for me to not kill myself are my daughter  now 23  my GF my job and our dog   I go fishing by myself in my 22 foot center console boat to a fishing hole that is 50 miles out into the Gulf of Mexico I usually go fishing 50 miles offshore by myself  If the seas are running 3 4 feet it takes me three hours to get to the 50 mile offshore fishing hole   I have bought a lot of safety gear that I keep in my boat I always wear an inflatable life jacket and if the outboard motor is running the kill switch lanyard is attached to my life jacket   If the seas are still up when it is dark and it is time for me to start the motor and drive the boat back to the boat ramp the ride back will still take me three hours  I am looking at buying a satellite phone as there is no cell phone coverage 50 miles from land  out in the Gulf of Mexico  I hope that my employer will let me work until I am 73  I find meaning in my work  I find meaning in my relationships with my daughter my GF and our loyal dog   If I ever decide to take my life out on a solo fishing trip will be a great way to go   I don t know if any of this makes any sense Thank you for reading my wandering thoughts  50 miles is 80 47 kmOnline dating seems impossibleI ve been paralyzed C6 C7 for over 2 years now I ve started dating my girlfriend right after the accident  while I was in hospital  2 yeare in and I cant wait to be single again I know it s different for everyone and I m still dealing with the stress and anxiety but my personal opinion is you have to first find piece within yourself before you start dating again Here is couple of things that worked for me to get out of very dark places I was falling into  1 Try to always stay busy reading audio books video games harder for quads but doable  2 Have a goal to learn something new and master it sense of accomplishment after sci is enormously important for mental health I ve heard hot to bake sourdough cook with limited hand function I ve just started reading about photography and most importantly I m growning out my beard that requires daily maintenance   3 Have something to look forward to New hobby activity scheduled for the week end I ve never been a fan of mma before but now Saturday is a fight night for me I get excited following pre fight interviews and keeping track of Twitter interactions  This works for me for you might be a Saturday meet up with friends game night cook or something that grabs your interest  4 When I first got injured people told me to give it 2 3 years and it will get better I didn t believe them But time does heal a little bit and with sci little bit relief can be huge I still have days when I let myself grief but I can see what they meant  5 When you feel really down take deep breath and concentrate on breathing I know it sound silly but breathing exercises do miracles for me   Honestly there s a lot of things that might work for you Every injury is different and we all deal with it differently My advice is find some balance on your own allow yourself time to heal and only then start dating Maybe by that time pandemic will be no more  You ve only been at it for a few days  Patience is needed here  Online dating means you ve got to play the long game  It takes a while to get matches and then to move from online to actual in person dates then you might have a handful of first dates before you even get second dates   You may get someone who expresses interest online maybe sends you messages but it never moves to real life dating  This is very common Or you may have a good first text conversation with someone who then blocks your number  Or you may have a first date with someone that goes well and then never have another  It s all part of dating unfortunately   It s easy for us to blame this on our disability and in some cases we may be right  but honestly this is all part of dating for just about everyone  I m not saying that we as wheelchair users don t experience a special type of bullshit when it comes to finding partners I m just saying that you shouldn t put every instance of rejection down to your chair Some people are just dicks  some are crazy or rude or immature  and sometimes it IS you  Or maybe you re just not compatible Don t focus on your chair so much that you become blind to the other things that are going on  One of you guys asked for my Tinder Profile I accidentally rejected your DM Please send a I m agien oopsie I met my boyfriend on match We ve been dating 2 years now I ve heard good things about hinge as well It took me using dating apps on and off for about 3 1 2 years before I met him I had gone on dates and was seeing some people but never anything serious My advice is don t date to try and make yourself feel better You need to be good before you involve yourself with someone else I chose not to date for 5 years after my injury cause I wasn t comfortable with myself   I paid for Tinder this month all I got was spam Anyone want to help me with my Tinder profile DM me  If you re over 30 there are a few subs that will help  r datingoverthirty r datingoverforty and r datingprofilesover30 to get feedback on your profile There are also subs for Bumble and OKCupid  and Tinder but honestly that s all guys complaining how they never get matches and giving each other terrible advice   It s pretty normal for guys to get fewer matches than women It s early days so far so don t stress too much Hinge is slower than Tinder which makes sense because it s more relationships focused I m a fan of OKC but to be honest it s also quite slow   I just like that you can have a virtually endless profile I tend to get fewer but better quality matches there You should probably know that Match was sued by the FTC for listing fake profiles to make the service seem more popular  https   www ftc gov news events press releases 2019 09 ftc sues owner online dating service matchcom using fake love I have had a surprising amount of success I have a new date today and it started when I just started being totally honest in my profile and then conversation I explain what happened what that means and what may be different if someone dates me Sometimes people balk but that is okay because it would not have worked out Persistence is key Also it s hard but learning bit tot take any of it personally has helped me  Why do you say online dating is your only option  I dated online once for about 8 months and I can tell you this   Now is a bad time to start   There are two sides of course it s painful for me to look back on it and the details are fuzzy but I attribute one of the reasons it fizzled out is because we didn t meet together in person once It s something you don t realize the importance of until you can t have it It s the little things like kissing cuddling holding hands and sharing moments together instead of relating them over Skype Sometimes it s emotionally overwhelming With the pandemic who knows how long it ll be before you can safely meet them irl   My advice is don t look for a partner right now  look for a friend Find someone you can talk to even better a group Then when this pandemic is over you can consider a relationship If it s with your new friend then you can meet freely without the strain of having no physical contact If it s someone else you still have a friend you can rely on   Good luck out there  I don t go out much anymore except to restaurants and the movies I liked hanging out at bars before my accident but now I don t feel entirely comfortable going Not only cause of the wheelchair but my bladder issues force me to wear a diaper So all that combined just stresses me out But also I ve never been one to approach and certainly not now I guess it s something I need to work on Anyone feel like a road trip Today I took a road trip  I live in California 12 min away from downtown San Francisco   I rented a car from Getaround for several hours in the A M I cruise by Pier 39  Fisherman s Wharf I stopped by Safeway grocery store for snacks Found a place I can people watch at the Embarcadero ate my snacks and came back home to sleep   This was a short trip I know but I dislike long road trips I get so tired and cranky  love road trips what are you doing Love a good road trip Where to  I m about 13 hours from you but I love a good road trip   I want to build out a van and travel the country   deleted  I ll be going toward colorado with dog and kitty This is beautifulOhio to Florida at leastU tell me I m in ohioI wanna build out a car I ll be going toward colorado with dog and kittyT5 Complete Spinal Cord InjuryDon t anybody believe this bullshit  This alt account is posting pics of Christina Vithoulkas and posting them as her own  This whole story is concocted  Good to see the mods pull all of  her  picture posts   Now to just remove this one as well   And going into T5CompleteLiz s profile is comical  All of those subs asking for sympathy and coming off as the hero   Wow What an asshole  Looking to Donate SCI EquipmentEdit  I m in Columbus OH Research study for women with SCIWhy women I feel like my anatomy qualifies There be are many questions that only apply to women  child birth especially  We are interested in how pregnancy impacts the urogenital and bowel health of women with SCI because they deserve to have evidence based credible information to make an informed decision before they decide to get pregnant or know what they may expect if they are pregnant Periods post injuryI m a c4 and I use a menstrual cup It has a steep learning curve but once you get used it it it s amazing It gives you a real idea of how much your bleeding so you can keep track of that I can wear mine for about 8 hours before I need to empty it  L5 S1 incomplete and I can use tampons just fine Make sure they are in the right direction  extension of your finger  An applicator should help with insertion  never used one myself but my sister is an applicator fan  Change them every 4 6 hours and you should be fine leakage wise I have far more leakage problems with pads   Maybe a menstral cup is something you could look into It requires a lower insertion than tampons and it s soft So that might be easier for you  I m t7 and I use them fine You ll get used to using them as you go If you are worried about leaks maybe get some of those period pants or use a liner at the same time for a bit  Also leaks do happen to everyone occasionally even without a spinal injury so don t worry about it too much  T11 and I use them all the time Even prior to injury I didn t feel tampons very much as they re meant to be comfortable and unobtrusive I find them less likely to leak than pads  My boyfriend recently got into an accident and has a SCI I Just wanted some advice on how to go about things Incomplete C4 5 Quad walking unassisted I was in rehab for 3 months which was the maximum time given No one was with me full time but I had visitors daily I took another month of outpatient rehab and volunteered for 2 spinal cord research programs for another 6 8 weeks at the local university which indirectly gave me more rehab time   I m sure it s different in each city and country Ask lots of questions   The goal is to help get your bf as independent as he can be  Ask if he needs help but chances are that he ll want to do as much by himself because regaining independence is a huge part of healing both mentally and physically   Stay positive Plan for the worse hope for the best Millions of disabled persons live their best lives daily I wrote and posted about my experience so you re both welcomed to read about my mindset what helped me recover and life post injury   Best of luck to you both  T10 10 yrs Can recollect the day I traveled to rehab from my city roughly 100miles away What is a must is to ensure proper rehab with really strong support staff i e involved physiotherapist and occupational therapist Identifying and going to rehab is first quarter of the job well done Goal oriented therapy should be given period is usually 3 months and one can come to rehab as out patient or checkin again for a couple of weeks to hone the skills   Right now the only question would be  why me   focus should be to move the mindset to  ok now what OR next what  Focus on what s needed to be done and you should encourage him to do things independently Confidence would have gone for a toss   These 3 months in rehab is to get into action and gain back confidence and will power   In India in the rehab I went to it is mandatory for wife or mother to stay along A studio apartment is provided where the patient and the care taker gets handson experience on how to lead the life after Sci 3 months down I was back living in my city And 20 days down I started working gradually increasing the sitting hrs   I had a great accommodative workplace when I got back In my country rehab can t be reimbursed sadly but in USA you can I wouldn t be able to comment on short   long term disability insurance being provided by workplace However I did hear insurance covers wheelchair too Companies also have medical benefits which cover it if it s a multinational company the likely hood of wheelchair benefit could be high   Little things is to each his own I probably really never focused or thought about it But my friends visited periodically relatives too I flirted with my therapist too I had a great mentor right next room to mine  25  yrs with SCI now  He got admitted for a completely different reason And I probably think he too had a great role to play in my outlook towards life after SCI   A few important little things that do pop up  1 Ideally every 20 mins a push up for 30 seconds However I would recommend every 10 minutes a push up for 30 seconds I did for 7 8 yrs this saves Sci from pressure sores in buttocks or under thighs Off late reduced since I do a lot of household chores Lying in prone position if he doesn t change his position every 2hrs  2 Proper intake of fluid at regular intervals  3 Sticking to a regime   schedule This will help body adjust and settle down later down in life Speaking from experience Starting from bowel routine to peeing routine  4 As a wheelchair user should build strong upper body strength  5 Leaks and bowel accidents will happen if regime is not properly followed and if they do He shouldn t beat himself down or feel regret Sometimes shit happens  literally   6 Be as a support model and encourager to do things independently and you shouldn t help However in case you realize he isn t safe jump in  7 Stay away from stem cell  8 As a couple talk to doctor about sex love and being a partner and understand how After SCI one of the major issues is no erection in few cases  Should be dealt before its leaves a deep scar I am not sure how it would be for his level of injury  9 Take care of yourself emotionally cuz there will be a lot of venting out Frustration  10 Get a proper seating cushion One cannot avoid sores even if proper cushion is used Which is why pushups Pushup meaning lifting the body up increasing blood flow to lower part of the body   I tried to be comprehensive here Much info available for me to finish with just 10   1 I went to a rehabilitation center in the country where I live and it was very bad the physical therapists werent doing their job well and kept looking at the time to move onto the next patient   Then I went to Poland where the physical therapy was very intense as it should be I was doing PT for around 6 hours a day   He should be doing as much PT as possible for the first 6 24 months as that s when most progress happens   I stayed at the center in Poland for about 3 months then went back home and had a PT visit me almost daily for a year and a half for around 3 hours a day to do as much PT as possible   I cant stress this enough but make him do AS MUCH PT as possible     2 The little things u can do is support him and motivate him to keep doing PT even if he starts to burn out Be there for him and help him      I wish you the best of luck  Hi there first off it s completely normal to be a little lost and feel overwhelmed in this situation The most important part of the process right now is to make sure your boyfriend has a proper support system in place from a medical and family friend perspective Sounds like he is being taken care of on both fronts which is a great start to his path to recovery   One question did the doctor mention if his injury is complete or incomplete This distinction is a starting point to begin setting expectations for his path to recovery   My personal stay at inpatient rehab for an incomplete t4 injury was 1 month Thankfully I was at a center that specialized in SCI so the level of attention I received was tremendous In hindsight I wish I asked for additional time at rehab the more work and gains you can make immediately after an injury is only to your benefit My recommendation would be to take full advantage of what is available to you from an insurance perspective Work with your PT therapists and doctors to fight for additional time if needed Also during his time in rehab it s important he has emotional support   it will be filled with highs and lows As I went through the emotional roller coaster I was fortunate to have my wife by my side She wasn t with me 24 7 but would stop by before and after work to spend a few hours with me On the weekends we had the chance to spend more time together and I had friends visit which was encouraging  Additionally I suspect your BF may need assistance with some personal hygiene   I imagine he would rather have you assist in this regard   Overall   you and your BF will get through this Along the way make sure you also take care of yourself don t feel like you need to do everything for him or you will get burnt out along the way   Wishing you and him the best Rehab took me like a week   Just let him tell u when he needs help  There are programs at community action Always ask for the home improvement ones 20k in assistance in Ohio  It s not hard to adjust Just love him like b4 nothing has to change unless you 2 decide it does  Couple quick ones   Get off pain medications as soon as you can   Avoid Gabapentin if possible  Get second opinion a lot of doctors unfortunately are not on top of their game   Make sure he gets good sleep and healthy diet very very important for recovery and is overlooked in a lot of rehabs  Holy shit I just read your post about your injury and im literally in the the same fuckin boat I got shot 17 years ago in the back it bounced off my scapula and hit c5 c7 I was told I d never walk I spent 5 months in the shepherd center and 2 months outpatient and walked out with a bad limp and very little use of my right hand Thanks for the advice I m not sure that doing as much pt as possible is for everyone  I was doing what you suggest and i m almost like before accident but have a friend who was doing 20 30 mins a day and walking normally surfing hiking It s different for everyone you need time to rest as well you can t make nerve growing faster Im l1 15 month after injury max pt i did is 2 hours a day mostly 1 1 and a half hour and have hope to be like i was before  Also i d suggest meditation that you can do as much as possible and lion s mane mushroom is very useful Thanks it started off as what seemed to be a complete but ended up being incomplete He was able to slightly move his feet around for me yesterday It was only a small twitch but he couldn t even feel them before the initial surgery I appreciate the advice    I already assured him I can take care of the personal hygiene aspects He hates being on pain meds He s on morphine and doesn t like it at all He will be off as soon as they let him so no worries in that department I don t think they prescribed him gabapentin but I ll double check No complaints about the doctors they re very optimistic about his condition and he s improving at an astounding rate I ll still be cautious in that regard though Thanks Henna Tattooed Instructions For My Surgeon  Stage 4 Ulcer On Tailbone My wife is a surgical technician and she got a good laugh out of this  I love this Good luck in surgery  Omg this is hysterical Please report back and let us know what they say Good luck to you    The pacemaker goes inside the other patient   Lol   so sorry about the ulcer Love that attitude  How did it go  Hilarious Keep your spirits up and good luck with it all  Yeah it s gonna be great I m not going to tell anyone about it Then they ll knock me out and flip me over and see the instructions I ll keep you posted Thanks for the positive vibes It went great The recovery is 4 weeks in a sand bed which is a little dreadful But the surgeon had a great response towards the henna

referred to this as  nerve pain   or discomfort different than musculo skeletal pain  in an attempt to get me to describe it vs label it  At onset in 2014  T2 4  I definitely had all 3 over time it is now mainly thermal Temperature dewpoint   humidity as well as hot or cold water when bathing or swimming all can wreak havoc I have tried gabapentin and Lyrica and their ilk to no avail  along with a list of others too long to include but probably mirror yours Opiates work the best across the board for the different types of pain  including allodynia  though there is always the big     attached to that route of treatment Having family   support is even better and it sounds like you have that covered Good for you  Great post hadn t heard nerve pains  true name before  What does the Oculus Go do

hospital A doctors tie brushed up against me once and I screamed and he insisted he didn t touch me  but then looked down and saw his tie  This confirm blows Light touches on my left arm are still painful but whack me in it and I m fine So strange  Well I ve never put a name to it but yeah I just live with it It s gotten better but I have to sleep with a heating pad on my ribs  Yes to all of the above It varies from day to day Some days these feelings are more intense and painful My physician prescribed a lotion that is mixed by a specialty pharmacy it includes crushed up depakote and anticonvulsant lidocaine and some other meds I also take Lyrica 150mg twice a day Fabric can not bother me one day or one moment Then it can start causing immense pain the next Same with a watch ring or necklace Temperatures can set me off too Things that are too cold feel like electrical shocks Things that are too hot feel like razorblades slicing through my body In addition I take a mega B vitamin Higher doses of thiamine are known to help with nerve pain I can t say for certain that it helps but every physician and mid level has recommended it  C1 quadriplegic here I definitely suffer from this the very same thing mentioned when in the shower or time to put on my clothes brushing my hair or washing my face that trigger Everything that touches the top of my head or hair or anything around my jawline or ears set off a bunch of nerves that I can t bare I have hyperalgesia on the  more  affected side Any pain sensation is significantly more unpleasant on that side or things that normally would not reach the threshold to be registered as pain suddenly are   https   en wikipedia org wiki Hyperalgesia Yes I never knew this had a specific name This sub is so legit thank you for your post Similar to your experience whenever I tried describe the pain I was told it was  nerve pain from a spinal cord injury     The pain I have occurs in my left thigh it is about a 7 or 8 and lasts anywhere from 30 seconds to 10 minutes It is enough pain that having a conversation is difficult to impossible   Occasionally the pain I experience travels down to my left foot and kind of shakes out Not sure how to describe it but if that does not occur it just bounces from my foot to my thigh over and over until I go to sleep   My triggers  fans vibration  car rides  and cold  T1 T5 injuries and incomplete sever I have all three and a range of other kinds of pain too I gave up the Gabapentin and then Lyrica because it was very little relief in exchange for having to take pills 24 7   I can t handle much touching and I can only wear loose flowing dresses that are large enough to barely touch my skin Had to give up underwear years ago Had to give up therapeutic massage and touch therapies It s pretty wretched But I don t need to tell any of you that  Thank you so much for this information  My husband has this burning sensation and pain from just his sheet or shirt touching him  He has chronic nerve pain and is being treated with Lyrica but it does nothing  It s nice to have a name and more information to go on  Ten years ago I got in a car accident when I was 18 and got paraegic I could not move nor feel my legs at all except the tip if my toes with the right leg s toe having more flexibility than the left  After a long surgery and months of therapy I was miraculously able to walk again but not without a price to pay   Since the nerves that control my left leg were more damaged I ve been having a burning and tingling sensation for about every night unless I m on Lyrica  which doesn t work all the time  It got to a point where I wish I never regained the ability to walk again to not feel this pain everyday for ten bloody years   It makes me question whether a life like this is worth living but I m trying my best to be optimistic and hope that someday there will be a cure  That s pretty awesome how long does the pain reduction last Any chance insurance would shell out for one  hahaha Thermal in right arm TIL that I suffer from Allodynia Not fun I m a C5 6 ASIA D Nerve pain all over my body The worst is when I touch anything cold Either with my hands or some other part of my body My nerves flare up like crazy I can t even find words to describe the feeling   Also I cant have my back  or rib cage back of legs either  rubbed even with the lightest touch It feels like a mixture of the the ache on your skin from having the flu and also touching a bruise   Im on the max dose of Lyrica I also smoke a lot of weed and consume CBD I fine what had helped me the most is Lyrica and a shit load of CBD like 300  mg You may have some room to increase your CBD dose    Good luck friend and great post  I am a T2 6  C3 6 neck fusion with a new cyst at T6 9 I have had 9 total surgeries There are a couple of programs within it that are my go to I go an swim with the dolphins or manatees for a bit or I use a meditation program Our brains cannot do to things at once so immersion in VR helps break the pain cycle It is a VR Helmet that breaks the pain cycle when you use immersive programs I put the helmet and and go swim with dolphins or manatees There is also a meditation program I use After about 15 mins my pain gets low enough that I can take the helmet off and pain has gone from 8  to about a 3 Your description of razorblades slicing is exactly what mine feels like at times Feels like my skin is stretched to capacity Wow that would make getting up and going much harder So sorry Mine is torso as my injuries are T2 T6 I have my rt leg and thigh that get what I would call electric shock I have always had it called nerve pain as well but through research I discovered the true name for it It least gives us a starting point by being able label it I tried so many meds The only that has given me a bit of relief is Gabapentin I take 700 mg in A M  700 at midday and 900 at night Mine seems to trigger more at night There is information out there I found a TED talk by accident one day that led me to keep researching Lyrica never helped me Gabapentin offers a bit of relief but not much nerve pain patternWhat is an SPT  Wahls diet is not actually proven to help with anything  I am T12 complete I also get bad nerve pain and spasms what works best for me is smoking weed but not strong stuff that make you trip balls I grow my own in my garden I ve only gotten extreme pain in my genitals when I ate edible marijuana similar to what you re describing felt like someone kicked me in the balls 10 times It sucks because it s also what gives me relief from my spasms Now a days I just use it as a skin balm instead of ingesting it Helps but not as effective as eating it  I haven t heard of the Wahls protocol thank you for bringing that up Did you notice a cycle in your pain before starting the diet too   Props to you for forgoing medications You sound exceptionally determined                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I m 33m T4 Incomplete but go through a two day repeating cycle   have been exerpiencing this for roughly one year now    Day one   The good day  Relatively low pain   tightness and numbness along the right side of my right leg which runs through my hamstrings and into my glutes   Day two   the bad day  icy   freezer burn feeling within both of my legs which spreads into my hamstring and glutes   When I ve spoken to my doctors regarding this cycle they seem perplexed and sounds like an outlier type of situation From what I gather most folks have the same symptons daily not on a cycle   Over time the bad days have gotten better the more I exercise its just strange to me that my body has some sort of internal clock that keeps this pattern  Anybody else experience similar nerve pain symptoms regularly Or notice any patterns The genital pain was a huge problem when I was still in the rehab hospital because I kept thinking I had a UTI and so the doctor kept treating a UTI when he probably should not have been but the pain was so powerful and so real I had no idea what else it could have been Fucking nerve pain man  I ve had really bad nerve pain I have never heard of Wahls before Also what is SPT My nerve pain is the  special part  too I m a T 12 incomplete sine 2013 GSW The pattern is probably due to your digestive system and urine intake outtake if that makes sense  Suprapubic tube I do usually hit a vape pen in the morning and smoke some of my homegrown weed in the evening and take a dropper full of my homemade THC tincture before I go to sleep which helps a lot with spasms so they don t wake me up in the night As for nerve pain it definitely helps at the right dosage but I m very careful so I don t build up too high of a tolerance and so that I don t feel like I have to be high all the time Yeah I get that feeling on the target day whether or not I smoke weed but smoking weed does help although if I get too high it definitely can heighten the nerve pain Thank you No I did not notice a pattern beforehand I was pretty much just at the mercy of whatever my body felt like feeling that day influenced by the weather and atmospheric pressure and such I feel like now I have a much clearer view of my nerve pain and can parse out unrelated symptoms easier As for forgoing medication it s mostly due to the side effects freaking me out or messing with my sleep or bowel program  constipation etc   Or they just don t work or I just have to keep upping the dosage and I don t feel like playing that game The intensity of my nerve pain on those days still fluctuates with the weather and atmospheric pressure yeah I don t get it either it s really strange but it s so consistent that I can know how I will feel months out and I have had other people keep track and I myself have kept a journal just to make sure and there have been no deviations Ha ha SPT is suprapubic tube Wahls protocol is certainly worth checking out and is a pretty healthy diet in general Women with high level SCI how the heck are we meant to deal with sexual frustration I know it can be a bit awkward to discuss but I highly suggest finding an occupational therapist you are comfortable talking to If you can find a sex therapist in your area with experience in SCI then that s awesome but I can t find one in my state Anyways occupational therapists are trained to help you find ways to return to a functional lifestyle including sex Find one you are comfortable seeing and they can discuss options for you to try at home   I hope that helps Good luck  I had spinal cord surgery c4 c5 about a year ago At first I couldn t feel much at all down there What really helped me was three things  1 I got off the cymbalta I was taking for nerve pain 2 My partner and I stopped assuming things For example we stopped thinking that if I liked something before I d still like it now We basically considered ourselves teenagers that had to learn everything from scratch  3 Realizing the brain is the biggest sexual organ Explore tantric sex and other ways of training the mind body relationship  I ve definitely been there Was 16 when I was injured C6 C7 and had little to no sexual experience I was not comfortable with my body for years after my injury I definitely had urges but was not ready to date so I would use a vibrator I didn t get much out of it but it would help with the urges a little I met my boyfriend at 25 which was the first time I felt comfortable with a guy to do anything other than kissing It helped that he seemed comfortable with my body he kinda just went for it and didn t seem nervous or scared about my limitations Within a month I was ready but that was after talking about how it would go and hat I was and wasn t comfortable with We focused a lot of foreplay which was helpful because I wasn t sure how my body would react to sex I know some people get dysrefelxia and it can limit sex I do have feeling below but I ve found areas that enhance the pleasure If you aren t ready for full on sex maybe try things slowly Kissing and touching is a good place to start  Is there any intimacy in your relationship Have you talked about wanting to do stuff Has he voiced desire  Hi I m female 20 years post First feeling lost and self conscious is pretty normal at the stage you re at Did you get any sex education during your SCI rehab  I didn t and many people women don t which is sad and infuriating imo     You can start with having a conversation with your partner about your desire to explore your new body and the next stage of intimacy between the two of you Does he still desire you but just not know where to go from here Do you still desire him but are simply too self conscious to approach him These are important questions   Or you can start by exploring your body by yourself and begin building self confidence from there Often with SCI the areas above our injuries become extra sensitive    this means that you may be able to derive A LOT of pleasure from having places like your neck and ears stimulated  I don t know if you are able to touch stroke these areas with your hands fingers but try it if you can Go slow Fantasize while you do it   Someone else mentioned the vagus nerve  this bundle of nerves that run from the brain down to the abdominal area is the working theory researchers have to explain why some women with SCIs are able to achieve genital pleasure and even orgasms In my experience this is much more easily stimulated by going for the G spot as opposed to the clitoris  https   www healthline com health g spot in women  After my SCI my body completely switched from wanting clit stimulation to G spot  Again I don t know your hand arm function but try to explore this if you can Try using toys    hell people even make adaptive sex toys for people with limited hand arm function  https   pleasuregardenshop co uk shop harnesses spareparts hardware la palma   Perhaps once you have a better idea of what you like and what might work you can tell your partner about it  Or you two can explore these things together    Last thing  Over the years I ve been able to cultivate the ability to get myself off mentally  It sounds laughable I know but it works for me  I talked about it at length in this thread  https   old reddit com r spinalcordinjuries comments fkjf8s sexual_needs fkuwfw9  This is also helpful when you re being sexual with a partner because it can really boost your desire when you may feel that the physical side of things isn t enough   Here s a site that has videos about lots of stuff including ideas for SCI sex positions  https   www sexualitysci org people with sci  Here s a sex toy disability guide  https   erikalynae com 2016 10 21 sex toys disability  Here s a podcast about sex and disability it s pretty well reviewed  https   podcasts apple com us podcast disabilityafterdark id1151890990 mt 2   Happy exploring  I wonder if a therapist could help I had one while I was still inpatient in the sci center and she talked to me and my partner about it and gave us a bunch of stuff to try there s a bunch of resources that you could read to the could give you some avenues to explore some of them are referenced in this article  https   en wikipedia org wiki Sexuality_after_spinal_cord_injury  I imagine the big thing about it is to have really open communication with your partner Best of luck to you  I don t think this is a problem that is unique to women You ve got a partner which is more than most of us I think you ll just have to make the time to do some exploring to find out what you like and what you don t  Vagus nerve You re still got all the connections you need  Hemorrhoid care and prevention I think you have to see a doctor for that If it s clotted they cut it out if not they treat it with a cream Have no idea how to prevent it though  Is Spasticity consistent or does it vary  Maybe I have an infection  Usually spasms have some form of consistency to you Night morning If that pattern changes it could be your body telling you something is wrong Spasms are unique to the individual For example  I get bad spasms when I sleep all through the night So I sleep in cannonball   fetal position One time I got a fever and my spasms were non stop stabbing me in my stomach until I got better     All and all   just keep a diary or mental note of what your normal spasm regimen is Anything else   then talk to your PCP or PT OT if you have one  Spasms are very individual to the person I suggest tracking your symptoms to find your normal    The first movement after some time of inactivity is what triggers my spasms The longer the better For example my spasms in the morning when I wake up are strong  I can also trigger spasms by twisting or moving after sitting at a desk for 20 minutes But those spasms aren t as strong as the ones on the morning  Thank you very much for that  Only now do I realise that I have had an infection long term  Things have been chaotic quick inset of multiple conditions combined with various medications  You confirmed my suspicions Thank you for the response   Some days I can barely get dressed somedays I can go out and shop   A Lot is just plain muscle pain  especially the abdomen contractions  MS hug   I just find the wide range of variation hard to understandPeople are attracted to my skinny paraplegic legs and feet it makes me extremely uncomfortable I ve had devotees approach me through spinal cord injury groups and I personally hate it I m not remotely interested in being fetishized for my disability I won t speak to anyone that approaches me this way  especially the ones that pretend they re disabled in order to join disabled only groups    I m perfectly fine with others who feel differently and enjoy the dynamic   two consenting adults and all of that But for me personally it s a hard no  I will not communicate with anyone I don t know on social media if they are friends with other women In chairs If I suspect they are a devotee I will block them I find it gross now because of experiences I ve had with them I also think power can play into it I think they like that you cant move your legs and they can kinda do what they want I ve also been asked questions about my spasms in a sexual way I have no tolerance anymore  I m quite undecided  I moderate r sciwomen and I state in the sidebar that they are not welcome there  which is impossible to enforce but at least I ve stated my opinion   That s because ideally I d like it to be a place were women can come and feel supported and safe and not have to wonder if devotees are wanking off to their serious and personal issues  How much of a reality that is is impossible to measure   Other than that  I tend to not want to kink shame  Consenting adults and all that  However I have had quite a few interactions with devotees that have not been fully consensual upfront and that pisses me off and tends to make me see the group as a whole as people who are creepy and not to be trusted  Let me give a couple examples   I have a Youtube channel  I get quite a few male subscribers who are also subscribed to other women s channels who also have SCIs  They ll leave comments on my videos like  Could you show a transfer   or  I m curious about how you put shoes on could you demonstrate   like it s just their innocent curiosity  and also like I m a fucking idiot   I don t appreciate this gross duplicity    I have also had men message me on Reddit  At first they ll act like they re trying to get all woke and progressive and learn about my disability  The questions start innocent enough and I ll think OK people need to learn I ll try and educate this person  Then the questions get more and more personal and detailed and graphic  and at a certain point I sigh realizing that once again this has nothing to do with a kindhearted person wanting to see me as more human    in fact it s just the opposite   So in conclusion I m over devotees because of the lying the deceit the creepiness and how they fake being disabled in order to get their jollies  Our community already gets enough shit from the world in general now these people want to come in and use us even more  Are we not squeezed dry already   I m sorry it just pisses me off that the able bodied world ignores us won t address inequalities or inaccessibility or our poverty yet there s this subset of them who uses us to jerk off and I can guarantee these devotees don t give a shit about any of our problems   But those are my own personal feelings  I know that sometimes you can t explain why you are attracted to something  So this is why I am so undecided  I guess I acknowledge that devotees exist and also that I don t like the fact that they do  It makes me feel pretty awkward ngl  not because someone is specifically into impairment just because its a mode of objectification that feels like they don t actually want to engage with me rather they want to engage with their  usually misinformed  ideas about quadriplegia Devotees also sexualise very weird actions in my exp like using my teeth to open something or worse actively sexualise struggle   I don t feel that in current society someone can just have an attraction to physical impairment or its consequences Due to how disability is viewed espec visible ones there s always going to be an element of freakshow or inspiration or something imo  I would consider myself a devotee I guess I m married to my partner who happens to be paraplegic T3 complete I found him attractive wheelchair skinny legs and all We dated for a couple years and hit it off We are gay been married 3 now We love each other it s not just about the disability or a fetish perhaps for some it is But people are either genuine or shallow Depends on the person Is like being attracted to someone because of their traits whether blond muscular skinny or heavy Male or female Is not necessarily a bad fetish that is to be scorned Its the person who I love and respect But I genuinely find him attractive and knew I would be a good partner for someone who uses a wheelchair and decided to pursue it Our sex is fantastic and we both love it It s all how you view it I guess Whether someone is turned off by a disability or turned on or is ambivalent We compliment each other very well and enjoy having an interabled marriage it works great for us  It s the weirdest thing and something I ll never understand When I tell my able bodied friends about that they honestly don t believe me until they look into it I don t think there is not enough light on this topic  I m 13 and also complete so  You know the drill of going to school They are called devotees  I have very ambivalent feelings about this fetish It s not my cup of tea but it certainly doesn t annoy me I just feel that it s none of my business what two consenting adults are into as long as it s not harming anybody else And when you think about it there are countless strange fetishes that are much worse  I ve been into this sci world for 12 years this July 31st I would post pictures of myself on fb in my wheelchair and learned quick what a devotee was It personally creeps me out So much so that I rarely ever post pictures including my chair anymore If other people wanna get into the world good for them  As long as both are into it For myself it s a no  To each their own i jumped down this rabbit hole once and learned that there are people who have onlyfans for this I ve been approached on my other profile by devotees asking for nudes and stuff which threw me for a loop especially since I wasn t posting anything to do with that fetish but posted in a different r4r mentioning i was a para It s not my thing but I m not going to shame them for it they just need to not be creepy about it  As long as it is mutual I have no problem with it however I have female friends who are stalked on Facebook and one who s pictures were Photoshopped and put on a fetish site Those people disgust me  Devotees are only for women though right I ve never heard of a woman who is sexually turned on by a disabled man I can see how objectifying it would feel to have someone find your disability attractive But honestly at least it s something I ve not had any attention since my injury as a dude  Cause someone is into your hardship Yes I know  Wasn t sure the word was allowed here   I was talking out of my ass when I wrote that response I just received a message from a devotee on one of my social media accounts and it made me realize that this practice of fetishizing someone s disability is wrong on so many levels It can t be compared to other kinks By being okay with it I d be encouraging the idea that your disability defines everything you are The idea that you re helpless because of it Finding someone s atrophied limbs or their dependence on mobility aides sexually arousing is extremely disturbing and I refuse to be objectified like that There s definitely females into paralyzed guys out thereyou are so wrongMy girlfriend is a devotee I love itBest way to stay limberDepends on what s causing it but it s likely at T4 incomplete you have some spasticity tone   meaning neurological constant muscle contraction that prevents you from having the flexibility and movement you should have Have you tried any meds for spasticity Baclofen Zanaflex or even cannabis Does it make it any better If so then it s likely you have tone and you should try to talk to a physiatrist  rehab specialist  or a family doctor about it Unfortunately using medications for tone or spasticity can mean that you lose tone or spasticity that s helpful to you   for posture or balance for example If the stiffness is in one particular joint like your knee  you might be able to get targeted injections to the muscles around it to weaken that muscle contraction ie botox   if you mean stiffness around your joints ie you re losing range of motion that s a different kind of stiffness due to loss of length in your muscles around the joint This is common when you aren t walking because you can t move your joints  hips knees ankles  through their full range of motion It can also be caused by bony changes in your joints   heterotopic ossification is not uncommon with SCI and it causes bony overgrowth usually in your hips that can cause that joint to become stuck in a particular position HO usually requires surgery to remove the bony overgrowth and restore range of motion in that joint  i do quite a bit of stretching throughout the day to help out but the effects don t last long i have really bad spasticity tone in my hamstrings those things are huuuuge i tried botox but it s too big of a muscle for the injections to be effective i m on baclofen and tizanidine but they re not really doing much either i have a trial for a baclofen pump next week because it has really negatively affected my quality of life so we will see how that goes  I stretch a lot too I also get a deep remedial massage every week as I spasm a bit at night as well as when I try to walk a little I d have a remedial massage every day if I could afford it  Hey For how long have u been using Baclofen Do u feel drowsy all the timeCan t ever get a break  REALLY NUMOTION Update for you guys  I crashed my car a few days ago and in the middle of a claim called Uber after my Uber cancelled on me 4 times because  they don t have room in the trunk for a wheelchair  I got an Uber and arrived at 5 15  numotion closes at 5  I am visiting Reno right now so I went to the Reno office but my case is all from the Sacramento office because that s where I permanently live The person at the Reno office put a new wheel on   temporarily fixed the chair Im getting my new casters shipped from Sacramento to Reno because I m stuck here without a car They helped me but damn I really need a better more durable chair I m 21 years old and very active It sucks but in the end it s alrightish I d rather switch to a better company when I m up for a new wheelchair but I don t know where to go through any help would be appreciated At least I m mobile for now Cheers everyone and have a great 4th  if your in the Reno area hmu  I have a bunch of fireworks for the 4th   stay up everyone  LOL Screw NuMotion Ugh  that s effing frustrating  I just ordered my first chair today through them A ki mobility tsunami ALX  I didn t know they made wheelchair parts  Numotion is the worst I would join any class action against them in an instant   frustration I ve had those exact casters and HATED them I m in the North East and the NuMotion reps up here aren t bad   That exact issue has happened to me multiple times so I just had different casters put on What kind of chair is that I have a Quickie and changed to some beefy Primo front casters  May be visiting vegasCan you fill me in on NuMotion Do they have a bad rep As a longtime manual user about to start looking at a new chair it would be most helpful Do you get nauseous when you have forgotten to pee on time I m a c5 so I get AD when I have to really go I have sensation so I know when it s time but if I really hold it in then I start sweating a bit and I can feel my BP rising and then that darn headache starts to creep up   Anyways regardless it s not good to put your body thru that and what I ve found over the decade of being a quad is that sometimes you just gotta take care of yourself before it gets to a point where your bodys telling you to take care of yourself   Everything has an affect on your body Big or small and you compound that over years  Not sure how you feel about it but I definitely don t want some bad news all cus I neglected small things over years  I get this C2 C5 6 incomplete quad some sensation regarding urination but not necessarily enough to notice unless I m paying really close attention I m also not the best at reading signals yet so can go some time before realising that I feel terrible because I forgot to go to the bathroom on time  It sounds like autonomic disreflexia which is extremely common with SCIs You may also experience skin redness and extreme headaches as a side effect It s a side effect of the rising blood pressure Make sure you address it quickly because it is dangerous to ignore In extreme circumstances you can have a stroke if you don t address the problem bladder or otherwise  Yeah you re right I m really bad with setting timers and going on a schedule because I don t have to cath and don t leak much I need to get better about it so I can  keep  not having to cath     though manual valsalva on my bladder isn t too practical either it beats uti s So you re right again LolYeah I just got alarmed today because I forgot to pee and then noticed I was a little wet  I m female so I wasn t sure if it was uh natural products or urine It wasn t more than a tiny bit but tl dr  it was urine   So I either need to figure out a better way to keep myself on schedule or see my doctor again  my condition is degenerative  because I m not one for leaks Thankfully I m just home all day but I hope this doesn t become more frequent No AD with lower level injuries T6 and above See here s where my ignorance comes in  I ve assumed that I m not  bad enough  to get AD because I don t have a thoracic injury I ve thought it sounds similar to AD too cuz I definitely feel like shit when I ignore my spasms bowel bladder or pain hunger   But then I correct myself because doctors always insist I don t have an SCI due to the level of my issues   So idk what to call it but it sounds like something I should pay attention to regardless How do you guys deal with quad belly I used to have a six pack I did 300 sit ups a day back in 1980   Then came the accident that rendered me a T4   I now have a keg   For the past 40 years I ve tried to find something to firm up and tone my stomach I ve discovered that there is nothing Getting liposuction is very dangerous and never recommended Starving yourself does nothing Binders can lead to autonomic dysreflexia Electrical stimulation doesn t work Punching it down like soft dough doesn t work  joking    After a while gravity just melts your body into a dammed pool of flesh With no stomach muscles to prevent the expansion and slide your belly will eventually look and behave like a half filled water balloon   So why am I posting Because it s good to be in the company of misery Let s never stop hating quad bellies  Dark shirts vertical stripes and rear lighting   I f      ing hate quad belly  If I lose weight it s almost worse because then the belly is all that s left  Bigger pants    Tbh I don t know if there is a solve physically but I know I m working on my self acceptance in general and that includes quad belly Compression belts are a thing but they don t really solve rather just bind   so for me it seems self acceptance is probably the most sustainable way to go  I reduce mine with a heavier meal for lunch and salad for dinner In addition cutting my 5 o clock beers helped immensely  I am looking at epidural stimulation Supposedly training can allow patients to control muscle even when the stim isn t active Here s the patient   https   imgur com a YkSLdtU  This outcome is rare admittedly I hear you I m C4 and quite underweight I also have the belly I ve had people call me fat including members of my familyPretty much I ve tried those compression belts before but too uncomfortable for me But those are also good to keep your blood pressure up if that s an issue This is insane Guy in a wheelchair amazing handstand Fucking paras always showing off Triceps are for

button This sounds very interesting Hope something comes up soon What are your thoughts There s a lot of interesting things happening but I wouldn t keep my Hope s high that a  cure  is coming At least not anytime soon  The cynic in me says It s not coming Too much money in providing equipment for people with spinal injuries   But I try and stay optimistic  so it could only be a few years away What s your go to way to losing weight Diet Less calories in than out  Have self discipline when it comes to food and work out   I do not have self discipline  Doing house chores including mopping cleaning cooking doing the dishes   and making sure my vegetable and fruits intake doesn t go down 4 6 almonds  I don t prefer animals as food  I kid you not I am being told I have lost a little fat in a span of 14 days I dont feel so but I am being told I ll know in a month or so   Anyway to the point as to how  just keeping myself busy with the chores  Eat less Go vegan  hold the sugary snacks  First diagnosed pre diabetic and altered my diet accordingly  No more of my beloved Mountain Dew    Ten years later diagnosed 2 Diabetic and altered my diet yet again  Switched to Splenda no more feasting on grapes     cut WAY back on the pasta    Bonus Medicare now lets me see a Dietician and I can now see how food affects my blood sugar twice a day  The later let s me make immediate adjustments  idk your level of injury but if you re in a manual chair you could go on walks  rolls   i m in college and transitioned from a power chair to a manual chair last year and dropped like 15 20 pounds just from pushing a mile or 2 per day since i ve been home I did laps around my neighborhood until it got too hot  I live in florida it was 94 out today  if that s not an option you d just have to watch your diet  Sorry but eat less is not the answer just eat more veganYup what he said I went vegan about 10 years back and stopped worrying about what I eat before I would only eat once or twice a day now I start with a Nutri bullet and eat what I want my bowel routine improved haven t shat myself and I ve had barely any UTI s  2 3maybe  since 23y post injury 10vegan I m way healthier now in my 40 s than I was in my 20 s I don t drink any fizzy drinks or eats sweets either and granted it helped that nowhere used to sell stuff that was vegan unlike now Same thing helped me lose fifty pounds a couple years ago I also stopped drinking alcohol  I stayed vegan sometimes I cave and have sugar Bro they make Diet mountain dew  It s great I want to find a group of children with SCIs so my child can enjoy being with people similar to him The phrasing sounds weird I know but are there any types of groups  excluding summer camps for obvious reasons  I can reach out to for my child I know the Shepard center in Atlanta has loads of groups and does a summer camp specifically for sci people Probably worth looking into or talking to them as they probably know different groups around the country  I would say to reach out to the closest children s inpatient rehab center and ask for the Recreational Therapist Leave a detailed message if you don t get him her Immediately Leave age what you are seeking and level of injury Shouldn t matter if your child has ever been a patient there Rec Therapists are awesome fonts of knowledge about community and community accessibility  Try looking for  adaptive sports  type groups near you Maybe on Facebook If your doctor neurologist is from nearby they might be able to help you too  If you re in the UK the Back Up Trust have an amazing U 18s group who go on trips around the country as well as weekends away  Sports There is a junior wheelchair rugby league which is great fun The adult clubs help out Take a look in your area    I recommend reaching out to websites with adaptive sports or recreation in your area Or talking to your local rehab center I heard of a guy that has gotten a group of teenagers to go bowling and such together from rehab Maybe you could start something like that if there is t something in your area already  I don t know of any myself but this forum  https   www carecure net   is  AFAIK  the largest online SCI forum and there is a lot of experience and resources there I would suggest that in addition to inquiring here you register at that form  free   and make a thread Tons of very helpful people there   Good luck  Also try Craig hospital in Denver Thinking of Urostomy I  c6 c7  don t know about urostomy but I do have a supra pubic catheter and honestly it s fantastic if you use a large bag you pretty much don t have to think about peeing all day Does Quadripeding use the hips muscles It s hard to say because quads and paras often bypass the use of alot of muscles and over compensate with others if that makes sense If you do it in front of a physio they would be able to tell you what muscles you re engaging  Hard to say What level of injury are you and what Asia   Are you hyperextending and locking the joints  This You may be regaining function and strength in those muscles you may be compensating and not realize it   We see patients frequently who return for an annual checkup excited about new muscle function returning But then upon completing and ISNCSCI  ASIA  Test it specific muscle testing nothing is  firing   they ve just subtly over time learned how to use what to  do  have to compensate for what they  dont  have Of course there are those who do have new muscles firing which is very exciting Anyone use tizanidine It s a lifesaver   Be aware that there s an interaction with other drugs especially   Cipro and fluoxamine   that slows the metabolism of tizanadine by your liver causing a buildup in your blood Among the side effects is a   dangerously low blood pressure   Your doctor pharmacist should catch this but numerous times they haven t with me so be vigilant  Tizanadine is great But passing out is a side effect of tizanadine And unfortunately it does not go away Not that I m aware of It can be scary too I ve noticed it when I take it and I have to get up during the 4 hour period before a next does Like before it runs out I ve been prescribed it for a car accident I don t have an SCI  But my brother is a quadriplegic from SCI He takes it as needed  I use tizanidine for sleep and believe me the effects can sneak up on you I have felt fine and bang the drug kicks in and I cannot stand  incomplete SCI  or use my brain So be careful and use it sparingly if possible  I used to take it as well but eventually discontinued it as I got more used to my spasms I found that wearing an abdominal binder helped prevent the sudden blood pressure drops If there was still a drop it gave me a lot more time to react to it  I was on this medication shortly after my spinal fusion for pain I ve suffered from insomnia my entire life and never found something that worked and didn t have side effects until I started taking this Now I use it right before bed and stay asleep all night and wake up without feeling groggy  It works  I don t tolerate baclofen benzos or dantrolene  but it makes me stupid floppy and I started losing some core strength so now I only take it at bedtime on days when I haven t been able to do enough to manage my spasms  Tizanidine was great at first for me  L1 burst incomplete  but quickly I found it made me sleepy and I was napping for about 2 hours after using it I switched to Baclofen for a bit but now rarely take it to avoid the side effects I m trying to monitor my spasms as best I can and figure out what is the cause and correct Mostly finding dehydration or a UTI are main causes  so it didnt stop your spasms Ive been on it for four months nightly at 12mg and I developed muscle spasmsAFO QuestionsSki socks mate they work great and are cheaper than specially made socks You can get them in any sports clothing shop    just wash them on a gentle setting They pad your boney bits which makes you are less risk of pressure sores If you don t wear socks you will likely get sores Listen to your orthotist  I have AFOs and I wear really long thin socks I ve gotten online called over the knee socks or even thigh high socks Thigh high is actually better because they provide more skin protection They protect my skin but are thin enough to not wrinkle under the AFO s or cause any other skin irritation Look in the women s section for thigh high socks Good luck  I ve been having good luck with knee height compression socks My feet sweat a ton so I usually get Merino wool compression socks but those get really pricey Most people I know with AFOs are happy with standard synthetic spots compression socks with a compression rating of 20 30mmhg In addition to helping provide a good barrier between the AFO and your skin the compression helps increase circulation in your feet which reduces the risk of pressure ulcers or blood clots  I just went on Google  search engine  and typed in AFOs socks and a bunch of possibilities came up I don t have AFOs so I cannot help with personal experience  No I pull them all the way up And my pant leg just looks weird and kinda sits on top of the leg brace I ll try to pm you a picture today Runners leggings work great for me as do compression socks Good luck  This I m in an AFO and am wearing my snowboarding socks They re the perfect length and they re comfortable All right thanks Folding them down over the top also Outdoor life with SCI We fished the food chain and spent the night under a tarp shelter Chase your passions Life can t be all gloom and doom Ducolax suppository useI use a 10mg suppository daily along with digital simulation   digital evacuation 1hr   1 25hrs and I am done I have followed a good dietary system so far probably I would also suggest to have fibre rich food or drink naturalax or locally available Fibre rich drink the night before and go for the morning routine Until your body gets used to 8 hrs is crazy time and unheard of for me I would suggest to check with a doc Probably you can also check your water intake and increase a bit Go for the morning routine at a fixed time window so your body also gets used to a schedule I feel system   schedule is really important after SCI   I m wondering if this is not good to use dulcolax daily  Do you do your program daily I no longer use suppositories I just use digital stimulation every 2 4 days when I feel like I need to go and it s been working pretty well for me  The usual in the UK instead of the magic bullet is 1 2 glycerin suppositories I am C4 quadriplegic since 2014   At the beginning we used suppositories with varying results   For the past few years I switch to Peristeen  https   www coloplast co uk Peristeen Anal Irrigation System en gb aspx section product description _3  https   www coloplast co uk Peristeen Anal Irrigation System en gb aspx section product description_3     x200B   Basically it works by filling your lower bowel with water when you release the water everything comes out with it too     x200B   I have heard of different people doing it themselves and only needing to use it twice a week but for me I still use it every day and and due to my injury I need someone to do it for me     x200B   It has been great and there have been no accidents since we started to use it     x200B   I I still take three Movicoll at night and a Sena tablet  when I get up in the morning I am ready to go and the Peristeen clears everything out     Its a great load off your mind to get that sorted out first thing in the morning and it means you re not worrying about it for the rest of the day C5 6 quad I had issues with Ducolax and would be over the toilet for hours I switched to Enemeez a mini enema best for me to use over the toilet because I ll have a movement within 5 min I tend to feel emptier and just better afterwards than with Ducolax occasionally will have big ole farts but they re not dirty or smell so I m fine with it Definitely recommend I go every other day and haven t had an accident since switching You can buy it multiple places including amazon but read up see if it s for you https   enemeez com I agree   schedule is vital I m tweaking mine I used to go weekly I don t eat a huge amount so it was ok  occasionally I d feel a little full I do feel better going twice weekly and trying to get my body into this amended schedule is proving challenging Haven t heard back from doctors saying it s not good I know people who have been doing it for 20  years And I haven t had any issue over the last 10 years  Saves me time  thanks for the reply Have heard about but never tried digital sim  Do you do your own or rely on a carer to do it Yeah everyday This makes sure I don t have any bowel accident And I don t have to worry too much about what I eat or drink I have retained same dietary and drinking schedule as I used to have before the accident Enabled me to live more freely Digital stimulation alone doesn t help me  Tried few times early on during my rehab   Right now during lockdown I tried to do every alternate days And still use suppository only to make sure everything is clear I am way more worried about having bowel accidents And before the Spinal injury I used to take dump daily Thought to not change after the accident  thanks do you recommend any particular brand and are these available on prescription Thanks this sounds exactly what I need I m in UK so I going to ask my doctor if I can get something similar Adapting an old Georgian home for recent SCI paraplegicI have lived 10 years in a home built in 1945 and am L something para Never had a lift installed so the upstairs and downstairs are off limits ie no shower or bath sleep in a non bedroom main floor I take Navy showers and wash hair in a sink Occasionally take an outdoor shower when it is warm with a large barrel and hose gravity fed Only a few bits needs to be regularly cleaned I admit this would be intolerable for some people but I was an outdoors camping person I agree about not moving a nice house makes all the difference when you are home all the time instead of a cramped apartment and the building work might provide something to feel part of Could consider taking renovations slowly and figuring out ways to adapt in the mean time certain renovations might not really be needed anyway 300k pounds sounds very expensive to be honest they must be lowering kitchen counters etc  nice to have but is it needed right now  I m sorry for my lack of content related to you question but I happen to know some medical researchers at University of Bath who do research with persons who have SCI Not that your father should volunteer but I know my friends are well connected in the SCI community and also at Stoke Mandeville Message me if you d like me to reach out to them and put y all in contact  I d suggest contacting Aspire   they have a housing assistance service that might be able to help with the temporary accommodation    https   www aspire org uk help with housing  https   www aspire org uk help with housing   In the UK you ll definitely want to look into Aspire  for housing and help with PIP application if needed  Back Up Trust  they do fantastic wheelchair skills courses and a great mentoring scheme  and the Spinal Injuries Association  their nurse advocate program is great if you have any problems with your father s care after he s discharged He might also find the SCI Owner s Club group on Facebook helpful   it s not open to family and carers so he would have to join himself if that appeals but it s a great way to talk to other spinal cord injured people about their lived experiences which is so different from the advice you get from hospital They ll also likely have some advice on home conversions   I dated a guy for awhile who had a huge Georgian house and it was a nightmare even though I m a walker You might find it easiest to think about what can be converted into usable space for your dad on the ground floor and even outside in the garden if possible You can also get grants for home conversion   you ll probably want an occupational therapist to assess your dad but I m sure they would have provision for that at Salisbury It s a big job but it s worth it and there is support out there it just takes a bit of time and effort to sort through it all Aspire now suggest contacting your local housing department citizens  advice bureau and or Shelter England to get support for long term housing Good luck  When I was discharged in 2004 in Wales they would not let me leave until suitable living area was available As for options I d look around for specific architects that specialise in adapting houses There should be at least one in spitting distance but check around for price Alot of those sort of guys specialise in these things and may be able to get a temporary fix while you get longer lasting adaptation I was absurdly lucky in that the scholl my parents worked at adapted their campus house but their must be other patients in your area going through this  Can he not get any grants from the government for the adaptation of the home  Governmental grants are really difficult to get and they also look at his income But obviously he won t be able to work anymore so we re in a bit of a tight spot I got such good horror stories from this bout of hospital shit I ve been thru last 2 months Tell them  Yes tell us You want to talk surprise bills just got a 200k surprise out of network bill for diagnostics while in surgery Like waking up in a pool of your own blood Then getting sepsis Then having the light directly over your bed malfunction and unable to turn off   It ll get better It has to  Yes dm me I have been thru the same maybe Hospitals are the worst man  How about needing not 5 or 6 people to do routine transfer from chair to bed cuz nurse was untrained and scared and being in pain from urgent need to be cathed but after letting nurse know she had to wait an hour for those extra people instead of getting one cna who knew what they were doing And then suffering pinched nerve that left arm numb with limited function for the next day due to their rough manhandling  Stay safe my friends Sci folks can easily get neglected while at a hospital I remember teaching nurses and doctors about my issues including how best to help me Communication is hard af when all you have is a American H S education  Wait   was that for intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring   I ve heard horror stories about insane bills for something that is considered standard I did this too I m way better homie holy fuck Message me I ll take u to Massachusetts 1 hospital in the world and u can be home in a week cured and I ll sit with u everydauGoing to the bathroom sucks i had to do everything on the bed for two weeks asking for gloves for bowl movement cath my self from bed  omg I just wanted to cry sometimes Computer Accessibility ResearchMany of us sci are too poor to have any type of cool gadgets  The main issue with computer accessibility is Money  It s HOT outside How are you guys staying cool Made a video sharing tips on how I stay cool in the heat Always been a struggle for me post injury to enjoy summer Great vid nearly overheated myself on holiday few years ago No idea how quads cope in hotter climates than the UK  Check out twofish biz for a Velcro mounted water bottle holder  The guys on the rugby team all carry around misting water bottles and spritz themselves to simulate perspiration Works like a charm  I don t know how quads in like Florida do it The humidity gets bad here but it never lasts tooo long I never realize I m getting overheated until I m actually overheated haha I m learning tho Glad you liked it Thanks for the tip Will do I ve seen those I gotta get a misting one to try Water bottle recommendations for a quad Hey man C5

incomplete and its pretty much always with me Pain when sittingHi  I had the same problem  and like you I trusted the doctors and took a bunch of different pills Uselessly Then I was told that prostatitis is incurable especially in a patient with a spinal injury then I told them to go to hell and started massaging the front of my stomach with my fists I did it 3 times a day for 15 minutes relief came on the third day after a month of these sessions I gave up all the pills and forgot about these terrible and excruciating pain Watch this video in detail    https   www youtube com watch v K _wnqLOMAMA  https   www youtube com watch v K_wnqLOMAMA   This is Russian doctor but I think your Russian friends will help you with the exact translation I really hope you can make it  Feel the urge to catheterise but can t That happens to me time to time could be a sign of a little uti usually I ll start drinking water when that happens and it goes back to normal Could be something else so maybe it s worth calling your doctor  Have you talked to your doctor about this  Definitely get tested for a UTI Abdominal heaviness is one of my main symptoms along with feeling the urge to catheterise without having anything or very little come out  Doesn t nessecarily happen to me but I think I know what u mean It s prolly ur body half healing and just trying to make since of the chaos I m sorry brother   I see others are saying uti I always can kind of tell when I m getting them I m sure you would noticed that right I agree get tested for a UTI Cranberry pills tooThat s rough I m sorry I think we all just have worse problems with bladders than anything I m using a Foley to just get relief for now and it s great for keeping a UTI away and just a legbag is not that bad Do any quads here own a handgun Only a para but have limited ab control  t 4 injury level  But just bought a baretta apx very light and small handgun I m only a Para  t8 complete  but I have a handful and I ve shot a decent amount after my injury My upper body isn t in bad shape so u can handle recoil and even a stiff trigger but reaching my arms out to aim makes me fall forward If I shoot with only one hand I can brace my other on my knees but that makes me a bit shaky I can scoot myself farther forward in the chair to lean back more but that feels awkward as well I just recently started trying to conceal carry again but it s super hard to conceal on a chair and it makes you paranoid when you can t feel it   Right now I m trying to use a walther pps it s nice and compact 9mm without a ton of recoil I m carrying on my ankle because I can t think of anything better  can t access pockets or front of waist back carry would place it between me and the chair can t chest carry because I m not gonna wear a jacket in the summer and can t carry outside on my side because I don t want people to know I have it or have it rub on my wheels  I also want a crimson trace for it but I can t do another  200 for it right now   For you since your a quad and I don t know your ability I d recommend finding a range that allows you to rent guns to try I have one near me but I fucking hate that place haven t been since my injury but I think it might be my only option as the other is a wma outdoor range I would start small and plink with a semi 22 just to get the feel and so how well you can control and then try some small revolvers or 9mm pistols depending on what feels good  Not quad T6 7 but I ve got a Sig Sauer 2022 Recoil isn t too bad might be difficult without full grip strength though  I m C5 C6 with only a useless flicker of movement in one finger and no not my a possible trigger finger     x200B   Had to give my my 357 post injury Never really for a handgun I felt safe using again but I almost committed to a Browning 22 Would ve needed to customize the grip   handguns in Canada were already then a hassle to own let alone modify even in the slightest     x200B   All this to say that I added a bow wrist sling to the grip Saved it dropping onto my lap or the ground when my fingers failed me That was my contribution to your search  C6 c7 quad and I own a ruger 22 rifle I got the trigger pull lightened because I was unable to when I first got it I also got it modified and added tripod that would make it easier Otherwise I would tip over if I held it up  Para but working to restore my fed background check so I can legally carry Really one of the best ways we can feel safe again but guns are great when respected for anyone as well I wouldn t doubt many quads have enuf function to shoot Or enuf skill to modify a contraption to hold a gun steady And point with the lips hello bang bitch u thought I was helpless huh who s feeling a breeze now in the good old chest How s the trigger pull That s the one thing I m kinda concerned about Well that and the recoil I appreciate the comment man Thank you U considered still modifying some type of helper U can still do so much but I m sure u know Just cuZ u can t hold it outright A jig can and u can then upgrade shit for all types of gunpowderily activities dude Don t just give up I made custom hand controls right out of rehab and was driving without a damn second cripple test asap And I ve rigged up ATVs that required feet to use and all kinda shit An electric scooter that was 200 but rivals the firefly attachment bullshit as seen on cripple inspiration porn posts but out of everyone s reach cuz it s 3000 bucksHey that s the worse I feel it Para but  holding on for dear life to every surface is a good way to catch covid We are the spreaders I m sureMy T4 Incomplete StoryI m a complete t4 and let me tell you it s rough But it s gonna be a great life my dude You can do so much even as a quad if you really want too It s all about your attitude And time really helps It may look like your life is over now but that surgery extended your best years Now you gotta learn to live differently but it s still living   I for one ride four wheelers and big trucks and just do what I can   I like to say You have life experience now that most people don t ever get brother Take that for everything it s worth Paras and quads can lead amazing life s but only if you take charge Just remember everyone else doesn t understand the extent of your injuries and that s one of the big issues with dealing mentally U will get mad for people asking u if you need babied And have times when no one helps u in need   And always remember We are the lucky ones Consider having a bad brain injury The body is just a machine We can still be ourselves even if it means adapting and pretending when we gotta There is always someone worse than you out there that would beg to be just a t4 incomplete Keep ya chin up  I m in almost the exact same situation 33M very active and healthy otherwise I did not require surgery because the docs feared I would be paralyzed as a result  cavernoma in my spine in a dangerous area  I underwent a month of inpatient rehab and then 2 days a week as an outpatient   I made great gains in rehab wheelchair   walker   walking sticks It has been nearly a year since my incident and I am lucky to say I can run and finally play sports again but of course not perfectly I still have numbness in both feet and legs and reduced sensation from the waist down  Also still experience issues with bowl and bladder that i m trying out different medications for   Every situation is obviously unique but I would suggest for you to swap the cane for walking sticks Like you my right leg was much weaker than my left for whatever reason and the ankle always dragged With a cane  not sure if you re still using it  I found myself favoring one leg over the other with sticks it forces you to use both legs equally and it s much better for balance I also got rid of the AFO early on I did not want my ankle to be reliant on it and train it to stop dragging It took time but it s feeling much better now  Thanks for sharing your wisdom Completely agree with your statement that life can be amazing but only if you take charge    cheers brotherThanks for sharing although each injury is unique it seems like we went through similar situations It s nice knowing someone else can relate  That s great to hear that you ve made so much progress especially with playing sports and being able to run again congrats   Inside the house I ll walk around without any assistance but still drag my ankle around   its not entirely stable When I leave the house I ll wear my AFO as I can move faster and it provides some stability Hoping to gain some knowledge and insight for a potential tv show about a girl with an SCII like what you re doing and I support it Is there a reason you chose L1 L5 In my opinion it s better to have a higher injury maybe T2 C7 8 The most frustrating thing I encounter as a C5 6 is that people think everyone in a chair is the same It s either waist down or total paralysis like Christopher Reeves It would be beneficial to show someone in between to educate that it s a spectrum   Hardest 3 things in my opinion are all social I am a male and and was very athletic active so that s much different though  1  Relationships A active person who experiences an SCI instantly becomes incompatible with their friends and lovers Finding normal people to share experiences becomes very hard As a guy being in a chair comes with a lot of feelings of emasculation I can t speak for women but I would expect similar feelings of inadequacies Online dating  speaking as a guy  is very difficult  2  Inability to travel internationally  3  finding a place to live even in the US Moving and finding an apartment or home is such a monumental pain in the ass Is the entrance barrier free Is the bathroom big enough Are all doors wide enough Etc   The biggest annoyance I always see in TV movies is that someone experiences a SCI then with a lot of hard work they are able to overcome and be normal again Culture and the general population picks up on this and projects this expectation to those of us who have an SCI 99  of people will never again stand walk move anything below their level of injury Having to come to terms with something permanent regardless of any amount of money or hard work is a struggle we all live with   I also don t like the traditional expectation that people who experience an SCI must automatically be an inspirational speaker There s nothing wrong with that but there s plenty of  regular  jobs we can do and some are held in very high esteem We re all still regular people and we prefer to be treated as such   deleted  I was 23  4 years ago now  after piloting a small plane that crashed on takeoff I could probably write you an essay of my experiences but I ll keep it short and you can feel free to PM me if you want more details or questions   I m T12 L2 incomplete   3 months post injury I was just finishing being inpatient at Shepherd Center in ATL and was transitioning to their day program   Weirdly enough the hardest part wasn t actually not being able to walk again but rather all the small things you don t really think about being affected Such as loss of bathroom abilities sexual function and realizing just how damn difficult it is to put on a pair of pants when you can t move your legs   When I started being able to take steps again people were of course super happy for me but it was almost overwhelming and it even felt insulting after a while   It s a weird feeling that your whole life just seems to stop so suddenly I went from being trusted to fly a small plane across the US to needing a nurse to help me take a shit   There are a lot more things detail that I have but I don t really want to clog up this post with them But feel free to PM me with any questions and I ll be happy to answer them  I have Central Cord Syndrome after being injured at the skull C1 I ve been able to make a near full recovery but continue to deal with a few SCI struggles Here s a little of my experience    the first few days home from the hospital were a nightmare Learning to walk eat dress myself etc again in a completely accessible environment was one thing But at home where the hallways are smaller toilets are lower and beds aren t mechanical  it was a total shock I fell into a small depression and cried nonstop because I wanted to go back to the hospital where everything was  easier  and familiar Looking back I had spent nearly 3 months in 4 different hospitals and probably experienced a degree of Stockholm syndrome    the inpatient OT PT and Speech basically got me to function again It was up to my outpatient therapists and myself to get back to my  normal  or discovering the new  normal   It may have taken me 15 minutes to put my shoes on but at least I could do it It s sort of a walk before you run mentality    Sometimes your SCI is just one of many injuries due to an accident For instance I broke both legs dislocated my neck and now have partial paralysis of my left eye So coming to terms with an SCI and all the other shit was a  lot  Oh I was also in a cervical halo brace for 7 months of my recovery  Nothing like what movie magic made it look like on Regina George     Something funny  my muscle spasms can be pretty amusing They re mostly in my neck and legs When they happen in my neck it looks like i just got the chills But my legs will sometimes just randomly kick once or twice Pretty funny to see people reactions    Please DM me if you have literally any other questions I used to have a small lil blog detailing my time in the hospital and outpatient recovery I d love to help in any way    I injured myself in a jet ski accident 23 years ago when I was 14 I ended up C5 C6 complete quadriplegic Meaning I can t walk have limited arm function and no use of my hands other than wrist motion   I can give you a view of how things progressed as you get farther on post injury I also had was born visually impaired So I was already dealing with a disability before I gained a new one    I m an absolute open book If you re truly going to make it show that actually covers the issues that people with spinal cord injuries go through rather than just  hey look there s someone in a wheelchair here  I would love to help you in any way possible I feel the more people learn about people with disabilities the less stigmatized we are Hopefully that will prevent people from staring at me on the street we re having people interact with us as if we are actual human beings rather then some type of coddled baby or as if we re all mentally handicapped  Feel free to ask me any questions or PM me  Get rid of the bit with where her pre injury life is represented so you re able to actually cast someone with an SCI Hey I m in a similar boat as you I don t have an SCI either but I want to write a love story featuring a quadriplegic character as one of the leads It s because I absolutely loathe the predominant idea that life isn t worth living with a high level SCI I want to counter it with a positive realistic portrayal where the disabled character doesn t want to kill himself and has a happy ending where he remains in a wheelchair  Take a look at this heart documentary I guess you haven t seen Super Store Glee Push Girls Speechless  Even asking people to provide this type of information feedback should be compensated It s pretty bad to ask disabled people to do free work to help with something that you expect to profit from Just something to think about even at this early point in the process   Edit  Also things like your wording are pretty off SCI stands for  spinal cord injury  You can t hire a  spinal cord injury    You re totally right about the spectrum I will change that thank you Appreciate you sharing your experience Very powerful and helpful thank you Will definitely look into a class appreciate that advice Thanks so much for sharing your experience I might PM you later Hey thanks for sharing I m gonna PM you right now Hey thanks appreciate your support and sharing your experience And that is exactly my goal   to make a show that is gritty and real  and also funny  in order to allow people to see beyond the chair That people with SCIs are just that   people  with interesting lives and complicated relationships and layered friendships and overbearing mothers and everything everyone else deals with But with a lot more complexity and difficulty than other people are forced to deal with Sorry to ramble just appreciate your support   from one stranger to another I may reach out via PM with your permission to ask if certain things I m working on are accurate and reflect your experience the way you d like them to Never seen or heard of them Do the deal with the joy of bowel programs cathing neuropathy or like most shows basically make SCI look like your biggest problem is not walking Honestly walking is probably 4th on my list of things I would like from a  cure Don t really think glee and super store are accurate representations of SCI life Yeah they have characters in wheelchairs Don t think they go that much deeper than that from what I ve seen For sure thanks But yeah hoping to dig a little deeper than a basic broadcast show I feel like those shows are more of a  chip And I wanna show the potato Sorry for the weird analogyI can t say I agree People are curious It s good to educate I understand where you re coming from If it quells any of your concern just know that I ve done hours and hours and hours of research and already have a fully broken story So what I m seeking is not help to create the story but specificity to boost the detail of my existing story in a way that honors those living in this world For example the last pilot I sold was about a professional women s soccer team I m not a pro woman soccer player but I did ask questions to women who were  simply to honor the specificity of their lives I just found myself in a unique position  interest from a network for a show  and I m just so sick of all the typical shit on tv nowadays and really want to shine a spotlight on something new on a world people don t know much about And like I said I m just writing this on spec right now for zero money And if it ever did become anything obviously my first very exciting step would be to hire people who have experienced an SCI so their stories can be told on their terms And also   thank you for pointing out my wording  slaps head  feeling like a real idiot In my defense the pandemic has made my brain mush and I know have SEVERAL voices I speak in on behalf of my dogs Thanks for your feedback really appreciate itThis is reddit if you don t want to answer don t answer but it is silly to say people should be paid to answer someone why just wants to be educated Exactly 100 days ago I took my first steps again Today im walking without a walker Phoenix rising is my celebration gift to self That s wonderful Your phoenix is stunning  Artist nailed it  WOWOWOW I congratulate you  Well done   Congratulations Proud of your accomplishment  Such a beautiful tattoo  Congratulations  I m so happy for you  Amazing tattoo to match a motivating story  Thank you all for the love  It brightens my spirit Thank you NeuralinkThere are already people with sci that have gotten neuralink implants I read about a guy that could control robotic hands with his brain   In an interview with Joe Rogan Elon musk was very positive  he always is  that this will help sci patients be able to walk again I m not sure if he s thinking walking as a cyborg or regaining control over body parts I think you think it s something it s just not gonna be Like many miracle cures this stuff is mostly getting funded just for the media You and I and regular cripple joe will never see it in our lives Some special TOP OF THE CLASS ALMOST CURED person will get tested to the hilt and then put in the tv lights Then everyone will ooo And ahh But it s just that I d love to get a nuerolink and control my Tesla with it But even if we had millions We are gonna skew the perfect image of results by being bad samples  in short Elon musk thinks very positively about science fiction thank you Did any of you become doctors I m currently about to begin my senior year undergrad I m a biology psychology major and chemistry minor on a premed track and my goal is to be a surgical pediatric oncology It ll be 4 years since my injury this August I ve always wanted to be a doctor and my injury solidified that  It s different from being in med school but I was in dental school  which did share a lot of joint classes with the med students  when my accident happened Once the extent of my injuries became more certain  C4 C5 complete  I opted to drop out   Besides the obvious physical limitations in the hands on work though I think just as challenging would ve been the time constraints that can come with a SCI My classes started at 7 30 and finished at 5 then most people would stay until 8 or so to practice in the sim lab clinic I personally wouldn t be able to keep up with a schedule like that post injury   All that said I know 2 different quadriplegics that made it through med school post injury As always it ll probably depend on your injury but there s a decent chance that you could do it if you re committed  I know someone who is C4 complete who got her MD PhD Not sure the extent of your injury but she doesn t have hand dexterity so she works alongside an assistant I know other accommodations can probably be made too She s definitely had a lot of people doubt her and tell her no but as long as you are persistent and don t lose hope anything really is possible Best of luck  If you go to the University of Michigan you d find a decent number of para quad medical providers I was recently admitted in the observatory emergency unit and my doctor was a paraplegic There s a good number out there I m considering physician assistantship due to my Visa issues but leaned towards med school for a while I feel like we all should link up    college students with spinal cord injuries    and serve as a support system for each other Should we start a group chat What do y all think  There are several paraplegic doctors at Craig hospital  spinal cord rehabilitation center  in Colorado The was part of an article in the  New Mobility  magazine recently that featured a nurse who is a para and it basically highlighted her stuggles strong points when looking for a job recently  I will search tomorrow for the article if you have any interest    I feel like I cant do it because I cant walk   The bigger issue is hand function My injury is so incomplete that most people would not notice it at a passing glance but one of my hands weak  grade III  and I felt I would not be able to perform any tasks that require two fully functional hands That leaves few areas of medicine  anything that involves performing surgery is completely out so maybe radiology     Also I am better with machines than with people      Maybe someone out there can give me advice   If you re doing biomedical engineering as an undergraduate see if you can switch to a more general major  EE ME possibly ECE  Biomedical engineering may be super interesting but it is also very broad and omits many of the practical skills required for an engineering position If a change of major is not possible try to fit in as many  general  classes as possible   You can easily get an engineering job in the BME field with a general engineering degree  EE ME ECE even CS  but if your only degree is in BME then you will be competing with people with more general degrees for BME related positions and have a much harder time when applying for anything no BME related  I am a C5 incomplete but only motor skills as C5  I m currently finishing my bachelor year in medicine  Feel free to reach out if you want or have any questions  I think it s a good damn way to understand the patients To have so many hospital stays where I ve been just disappointed in the care I can treat someone with the respect they deserve and at the same time know to not just grab a leg and move it  it hurts elseware sometimes that you don t see Just cause it looks healthy and you think you can just do things your way  that can scar a patients mental health and scare them from even getting treatments And it goes for all illness Thats amazing  I really hope you have an amazing senior year and get to live out these dreams  3 what school do you go to out of curiosity Thank you Its interesting to see a lot of testimonies about quadriplegics taking on the challenge Im a T12 with pretty good recovery so these stories have definitely helped me with perspective for the future   Thank you for this Im a T12 so I have confidence in my ability to keep up I just feel insecure going into interviews sometimes because I feel like its more of an inconvenience to make accommodations than to just hire someone else I know thats just something Ill have to overcome though so thank you for your encouragement   Id love a college group chat I have such supportive friends at school but its almost irritating talking to them about things I deal with because they dont get it It would be nice to have a support group for those rough nights   Yeah i read about Craig online definitely makes me feel more capable of doing it myself   Yeah that would definitely be an interesting read Viagra fail50mg is a pretty low dose 100 200mg is standard  depending on your weight  Your other option is Cialis which has better outcomes for some people It s important to know that getting into the mood can help as can stimulation of erogenous zones even if you don t have sensation I know people that have had success with vibrators and other toys It will never be the same as before but with some experimentation you can have a very satisfying sex life  See if you can get a prescription for Alprostadil AKA Edex   Edex is SUPER expensive and most insurance won t cover it but if you can find a compounding pharmacy that will mix up Alprostadil  the generic  it s significantly cheaper  I ve had pretty good results with it  Try marijuana edibles or smoke works really well for me and it increases sensation for me as well Makes sex feel way better in my opinion I would advise to only have a little bit first if you are not used to it  Yeah viagra did Jack shit for me cialis did a little better but I never truly got hard I ve also tried a pump but the effects just don t last I want to look for more options but my insurance doesn t want to cover any of it  I ve been not using my junk for 5 years so long it just left It s still in there somewhere but damn if I m ever gonna see my 7 inch boner But I don t crave sex really and the old lady is cripple thank god and is ok with just a good friendship type relationship its rough tho when ya gotta please an able bodied sex fien cuz I ve done that too and didn t enjoy much Sad cuz she was great out of bed And I m sure in bed once upon a time we woulda been the perfect couple Try Alprostadil injections instead if you can It will be more of  will this ever go down   rather than the opposite   Viagra works on the part of the mind that makes you in the mood rather than getting the blood flowing from how I understand it You need the latter as the signals from the brain are there they just aren t reaching your junk   You could try Cialis instead I unfortunately found it was of little use like Viagra was   Instead of Alprostadil if you can get spontaneous erections you can try a constriction ring too I would recommend getting a few sizes if possible and think small as you re trying to temporarily reduce the blood flow   Lastly if you re on oral Baclofen lower your dose prior as it can also help  Viagra doesn t work on the mind it relaxes the muscles and increases blood flow It s a  vasodilator      Infected Ulcers My story kinda I m a T 1 Paraplegic for 41 yrs had a few minor coccyx break downs over the years If you shower daily   keep the wound clean following Dr instructions they generally heal well I have to agree with the medical people that you were NOT staying off it or not doing proper pressure releases for it to continue to get worse My wife is also a 20  yr para we both average 12 14 hrs a day in our chairs   stay free of pressure sores     I kind of just sat on the sidelines and hoped wound care would take care of me   Your quote   This was your mistake wound care is there to  assist you  they are not there 24 7 to take care of the wound that s your job    Hope you can get it healed   stay sore free learn from the experience I do not know how to do this but I treated myself like this   diet  complete exclusion of any glucose and sucrose  that is you can not eat sugar fruit pasta muesli any bread cookies  etc you  https   etc you  can not drink coffee and tea This is because bacteria need to exclude easy access to food  Hydrogen peroxide  wash all wounds 3 4 times a day with undiluted peroxide add 10 drops to a glass of water and drink before eating 1 time a day  caution  after a while there will be a strong relaxation of the intestines  this is because you need to exclude all bacterial flora even from the intestines Breathing  to increase metabolism you will have to hold your breath using the Buteyko method One last thing  you ve already taken antibiotics And what did it lead to  I took this treatment for a long time 3 months I used oflomelid ointment PM me with any questions Good luck and be carefull Your healthcare system failed you There was no coordination from what I see on your story Your GP at the very least should have been conducting the orchestra Even better a physiatrist It does sound a bit like wound care wasn t taking it seriously  it sounds like from the beginning you had little trust in wound care but that still means you need someone to help you monitor your wound screen you for signs of infection etc Wound care here is done by community health clinics and they come weekly to at very least measure the wound and take a pic if nothing else is needed An OT sees you weekly or biweekly There s an SCI specific wound program run by a PT wound care nurse and physiatrist   The other thing that I think you probably didn t know when you didn t follow up with wound care is that what looks like  bandaids and ointments  usually involves regular assessment plus they have access to specialized dressings and treatments your doc wouldn t have in the office It sounds like wound care had nobody knowledgeable in SCI like an OT and physiatrist to manage the process ensure you could stay off your coccyx keep your foot up so your toe could heal and vigilantly monitor for signs of infection    Any system that functions only when the patient is an expert in their condition does not provide a reasonable standard of care to 90  of patients Sure there were mistakes you made But it does sound like you weren t served well by these uncoordinated services with nobody actually as the named person in charge directing your care Pressure ulcers are major medical and surgical issues for a person with SCI and require a coordinated approach  I ma come back and tell some stories of my recent almost death over this crap U got a lot to take in let me scheduale a time for this one and I d love to share as well  Yeah that s really hard to determine I ve been in the chair 5 years now and have had similar wounds on my butt and have been able to get over them decently I really feel like the issue here was the infection and the way they handled trying to treat it   But either way I appreciate your advice Thanks   I am curious if you felt the same way with my toe They only cultured it once then never again until they amputated then it turned out it had an infection also This sounds intense but it makes sense Pretty much do anything that can take away from feeding the infection Random story now that I ve been on the IV antibiotics I had an adverse reaction to one It caused a my absolute neutrophil count to be suppressed I ended up in the hospital again for a few days till they switched my antibiotics Then the count came back up The doctor said there was a less than 1 percent chance it can happen and it happened to me Hydrogen peroxide is   terrible   for pressure sores It actually kills granulating cells OP don t do this I think this is the best reply  Others are ragging a bit on the OP but really he she has only been in a chair for 5 years which is not long relatively speaking    It s scary when you know more about SCI than the people taking care of you    and it happens way more often than newbies think  It s very common to believe that medical professionals know what s best  In my first years of SCI I certainly experienced injury through healthcare because I put my trust in medical workers who in reality didn t know anything about SCI  In all my 20 years of SCI the only times I ve gotten pressure sores have been in the hospital    because the nurses don t understand how to take care of my skin  I ve had my body position moved while I was sleeping or under anesthesia and woken up to red marks   I m sure there were things the OP could have done better    and I m sure they ve learned hard lessons    but they also can t be blamed for substandard care and they can t be blamed for not fully understanding the culture of medicine where doctors have a hard time simply saying  I m not an expert in your condition I m going to need some outside consultation    SCI has a steep fucking learning curve especially when the dominoes start to fall  It s easy for those of us who have been injured for decades to say  Shoulda known   But I remember those first years when there was still so much to learn when I still had so much trust in the medical establishment I was still beginning to really grasp how quickly things could go wrong and finally still learning how important it was for me to speak up when I felt something wasn t right with my body even when doctors would disagree Thank you for your thoughts Honestly I believe that was one of the biggest issues there was no single person overseeing the case I am just trying to decide if I just want to let it go or pursue it with the hospital I m way down to hear your story  What happened I saw your message a couple days ago and have been super curious They moved my flap surgery to the 8th so I ve got plenty of time to listen Treatment optionsI also see an osteopath monthly for adjustments My cousin became a paraplegicLearning to drive Depending on where you live you can probably find an adaptive driving clinic The outpatient clinic I went to for therapy also had a driving rehab clinic that was run by an OT who was also a certified driving instructor The clinic owned some vehicles with various types of hand controls just like a driver s Ed school would own some cars I did a few sessions of practice in their car and then used their car to take the normal state driving test I drove before my accident so I needed fewer classes than you may need depending on your state s requirements   If you have any questions about hand controls driving modifications etc feel free to reach out via comment or DM My older sister is actually an OT and driving rehab instructor so I know a decent amount about adaptive driving beyond just my own experience  I got my driver s license in rehab and it was honestly super easy Don t worry about it you ll be fine sorry i can t contribute  all  that much to help you but firstly i just wanted to say that i m in the EXACT same boat as you are i also had my injury before i ve learnt how to drive and i ve been confused about it all i ve been debating on whether or not to even take drivers ed in school but like you i want to be independent the main thing i d focus on what  you  are comfortable with and figure out what you can do and what you struggle with physically it s been super helpful for me to just talk to everyone medical professionals teachers family etc about what i m worried about when it comes to driving just getting my thoughts out there and seeing what other people can contribute to the conversation it can feel weird but most times it s super helpful to get outside input especially from people who already drive but remember you know yourself better than anyone else so don t make decisions based on others opinions if you don t agree with them or if you re not comfortable with them i wish you luck on your driving journey and know that it s oddly comforting to hear that somebody else is going through something like i am haha you re definitely not alone  Honey I hope you re prepared for a long time before you can even start practising I applied for a provisional licence just after my 16th and I haven t even started lessons yet  I turn 19 in 2 months   Firstly you have to have a expert in disability driving write a report saying that you can drive safely and what adaptions you would need Then you have to apply and wait for your license to arrive  it took mine around 5 months  Then you need to start shopping around for cars with the adaptions required or if the adaptions are unique and you can afford it get in touch with a adaption company and order a bespoke car If it is built from scratch that can take 3  months Meanwhile you have to look for a instructor who specialises in adaptive driving and start practising your theory  It is such a long and draining process that is necessary for you to be able to drive safely PM if you want to chat in more detail X It was really easy and almost all the other injuries I know drive too Like others said try to find an adaptive driving school or teacher or clinic or whatever I got a note from a Doc saying the controls were necessary and scheduled the test ASAP Test was at a normal registry with nothing special in regards to my situation Honestly take the courses and go for it Worst case they deny you and you try again after some time practicing and reviewing  I was 16 when I was injured and didn t drive I started the process of trying to drive when I was 19 and I didn t start driving until I was 22 Not sure if you live in the US or not but if it s the US look up if they have a state run program that can help you pay for it Mine is called OVR office of vocational rehabilitation  their goal is to help people find jobs and go to school and in order to do that you need transportation When I first applied I got denied but was approved the second time They paid for my 12 driving lessons There was a rehab near me that had a driving school so I went to them and used their car for the drivers test After that I looked for cars Due to getting help with passing for it the van had to be a certain year or newer and less than 50 000 miles I payed for the van and OVR paid for the modifications which were  34 000 I had done fundraising so that I could afford the van I am a c6 c7 so I chose to get a van You can also go the route of finding a used van if you can t get a new one Fair warning it is all expensive If you can do fundraising I would suggest that If you live in the US and have more questions feel free to pm me  Do u have access to basic tools materials and a vehicle I made my own controls and have improved them over the years to a state I enjoy Better than the thousand dollar setups that are out of reach for so many And in the grand scheme I ve never been retested after the accident but I was also fortunate enough to allready have a license and keep using it        What they said I m a C3 incomplete I was fortunate that I transitioned from inpatient acute rehab to an OP therapy clinic that offered an adaptive driving clinic It could be called adaptive driving services medical driving rehabilitation program or just driver rehabilitation program If you don t have one in your area or need help finding one your PT or OT can usually find one I m addition some DME companies know of clinics that do this evaluation and training Another  1 to this I took drivers ed in high school summer school and did the written test as you d usually expect at DMV Found a major driving school in my area  SoCal  that also offered adaptive lessons and then used their car to take the test but didn t actually get my own car until about five years later   That said a lot also depends on your level of injury as well  I m a complete T 12 but had plenty of upper body strength even back then The hand controls themselves don t require a ton of strength to operate  if you can open a door you can operate the controls but it does get tiring during long drives at first Aww well thank you for your input  Youre right it is comfortable knowing others are thinking the same thing Most people on the subreddit had their injury later in life so theres a lot of things that are unsure for us    it sounds like youre a bit younger than me so if you need any advice on things feel free to message me    oh dear that is a lot haha but thanks for the input Hopefully if I start the applying part of it this summer I can take care of the rest by next summer Thanks again for the honest rundown   Okay sweet I didnt think about needing a doctors note so thank you for bringing it up Spinal Cord Injury Research   Women s HealthAnybody got experience with the Stem Cell treatment therapy Using a buzzword to make money off the desperate  Let s be honest here guys We re not walking anytime soon If ever Especially those of us that have been injured for many many years That s not what these treatments are for  Many of them are trying to sell it as such but the reality is it s not going to happen   What is a potential is getting small perhaps even micro gains Have a better sense of when you need to go to the bathroom say Or maybe you can slightly move your fingers now  Nothing earth shattering   I have a friend that s T5 complete She has done everything and anything including going to India and getting prahnic healing  She got stem cell therapy from some clinic in Minnesota at the end of last year She tends to be kinda vague about anything that she s gained but she does claim to feel better have less spasms and generally feel stronger I don t know if that s attributed to the cells actually working or if it s a mind over matter issue  I m rooting for her but I I m a realist bordering on pessimism I don t think she s ever going to walk down the aisle at her wedding like she hopes to   Frankly if something can give me bowel bladder or sexual function back I d be a happy girl All three would be awesome but I d take any one of the three  Unfortunately none of this stuff really works  yet     otherwise I wouldn t be in a wheelchair right now  There are places in the US that do Stem Cell treatment   I m a T5 and have not had these procedures done but do know somebody who has had them done I m not sure what benefits they give but but he is still paralyzed  Low level quad I knew spent 25k to get stem cells  not sure what kind  treatment   I asked him if it helped He said he can kind of feel when he has to go use the washroom That s it Hes still in his chair and with next to no hand function   Save your money  I went into biomedical engineering after being injured thinking I would find a cure for spinal cord injuries About a month into my first semester I had my dreams crushed when it comes to the promises of stem cells Its not sciences fault but the use of stem cells is entirely based on if your body takes it in and uses it for the target goal which is quite difficult for the nervous system to do There are other possibilities though that I hope to work for in the future But for now stem cell therapies are not FDA approved however users may try it of they feel like taking the pricey risk I was a subject in a year long phase 1 Schwann cell clinical trial at the University of Miami s project to cure paralysis Not the same as stem cells They harvested the cells from a nerve in my calf and injected the cells at my level of injury I am a C5 complete injury So far nothing has changed in regard to my function feeling etc  but the stuff they do there is extremely promising  https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT03979742  From hearing him speak in studies done already in China and India they actually got really good functional return from just the 6 6 6 intense physical therapy routine without stem cells There s no magic pill unfortunately I included a link to his latest study with umbilical cord stem cells that was supposed to start this year It s the first US study if I remember correctly which is a big first step for FDA approved treatments  Stem cell therapy has the potential to restore and regenerate spinal cord nerves damaged by trauma But this has not yet been proven Research in this area is mostly at the experimental stage Therefore I think that there is no point in spending a lot of money on a ghostly hope it all depends on the degree of damage to the spinal cord If there is no tear and there is only a severe bruise everything will recover over time if the brain is torn you have big problems and will have to deal with self healing for many years only a combination of long term physical training pranayama practices and meditative training has a small but effective effect in cases of severe spinal cord injuries While all that is definitely true you d be surprised how much even slight finger function can improve quality of life for a quad Do you have direct experience with such a treatment or is the lack of peer reviewed studies your main point How to motivate family member with SCII think I can understand how he may feel When I started walking again everyone was constantly praising me and encouraging me and it felt suffocating and almost a bit insulting after a while Yes I know it s a big deal to do any sort of walking after a SCI but I also hated all of that praise and stuff too I would get so angry at it all bc I would be thinking  you praise a 1 year old for taking 10 steps in 20 minutes don t praise me  23 at the time  for doing the same fucking thing  It felt patronizing after a while and only made me feel kinda worse about it I just wanted people to treat me like normal not like a toddler   Maybe he s feeling that too Try just talking to him about it It feels weird to be freshly injured people can treat you like you re helpless they have the best of intentions but it still is a hard thing to deal with  I agree with the other commentor give it time I m about a year and a half post injury  C5 C6 complete  and only now am I interested in trying to better myself and really live again Best of luck to you guys     Give him some time It took me a couple years to come to grips with being paralyzed for the rest of my life  I agree with the time comments Its hard to explain how he feels and what he s going through to someone who hasnt had to deal with it So patience and time is my suggestion  It s not for everyone but speaking to a psychiatrist and getting on antidepressants could help If he doesn t want to help himself he s probably depressed  Two thoughts has he had the opportunity to speak to anyone with a spinal cord injury to get a better sense of their journey You can find him one through the Christopher Reeves Foundation   https   www christopherreeve org get support get a peer mentor  https   www christopherreeve org get support get a peer mentor   I d also attempt to get him into formal therapy if he s not already involved I know I might respond very differently to my family telling me to do something as compared to a professional  You want to make a man cry for his weakness  I don t agree with you here first it is necessary to find something positive in any situation something that will help further recovery in the difficult and long struggle for health There is no point in looking for the culprits and there s no point in blaming yourself  Ask him what he thinks about this Does he want you to push him so he does it or does he want you to back off for a while so he can wrap his head around this Or is he already doing a much as he feels he can without it affecting the rest of his day  pain energy sleep strength    Could you make it easier on him by doing something fun  normal  while he s training   Stand and cook together it will make time pass quicker and distract from pain issues while you chat Bonus  food after Sandwich salad or full dinner whatever works   Listen to an audiobook or serialized podcast while he exercises so it s something you both all can look forward to and no walking means you won t know what happens next Maybe start with a short book   Or you and the rest of the family do a full pushup for each step he takes so you can all struggle together to get stronger and make it a little competitive Winner at the end of the week gets control of the TV remote for the night or something  Just show him how lucky he is to be able to walk and hold on with his hands Tell him about the thousands of people whose lives have been a nightmare since their spinal cord was severed You can tell him that it will take another year or two of intense training and he will feel as like if nothing happened I strongly disagree with this I m an L1 incomplete and have a lot of ability compared to other people with SCI Anytime anyone told me how lucky I was it just made me angry at them   Sure I was lucky compared to some people But I was also horribly unlucky compared to the entire able bodied population Just because someone reminded me that some people have it worse didn t make my situation suddenly sucks less Those comparisons only made me feel guilty for feeling bad and angry at the person telling me because they had no idea how hard it is to loose any amount of ability   Every SCI is different Every person s reaction and way of processing their new reality is different But in my experience comparing myself to others never brought anything positive   OP some days your dad my feel like shit and not want to do anything And that s OK He s allowed to be angry and bitter and sad He had so much taken away from him that s a natural reaction If he never is able to move past that it s probably good to seek mental health help But he s only 10mo out He s doing a lot of processing It takes time to come to terms with what happened and have the energy or the desire to push himself Leg function limited arm Look up  central cord syndrome  Have you had an EMG It sounds like there may have been peripheral nerve damage  Central cord syndrome manifests the way you describe although it doesn t make much sense given your situation   usually with such an injury the function of the legs is preserved and the function of the hands suffers even if there is no severe damage to the spinal cord be patient do hand training and breathing exercises using the Buteyko method It also helps to influence the acupuncture points on the hands Also check spinal cord syrinx Given the injury and worsening after post op normal function this is a possibility You would need an MRI I ve had 2 One showed a loss of nerve signals at the C8 level of my spinal cord and one showed nothing Completely healthy signal But I have a 3 tier spinal fusion Had an a completely unstable fracture at 2 levels with a bend in my spinal cord They rushed me to the hospital and completely removed my completely crushed C6 and fused me with a metal plate and and 4 bolts My C5 facet joint was fractured clean off and removed as well They said there was a significant spinal fluid leak and build up but the source was never found and they had hoped there wouldn t be more It had seemed to stop and they couldnt risk staying in to locate it I had optical damage and ruptured all the blood vessels in my left eye during the procedure and have vision problems now as well I was fine for about 6 months full function Began to lose function again after that I just looked it and plan to look it up further I broke my neck  cervical spine  in 2 places from a car accident after suffering a severe neck trauma from the airbag after flipping and rolling multiple times Platelet Rich Plasma therapy for SCIArtificial urinary sphincterI asked my uro about this before  He said the AUS is good for cases were the sphincter doesn t work but the bladder can empty examples he gave were prostate surgery and injuries to the urinary track  With retention the bladder still won t empty completely and needing to cath still  but with the added issue of the AUS making that more difficult  Not sure if we are talking about the same thing but here is a copy paste of what I wrote regarding a Mitrofanoff procedure in an older post   I ve had mine for about a year I am a C5 with very limited hand function My mitrofanoff exits in the navel As far as I know it depends on your preference and the actual length of your appendix  or substitute    Due to a spastic sphincter muscle leading to my bladder normal cathing was very problematic  several urologists struggled for 20 30 minutes sometimes  I used a supra pubis for a long time After a year or so I started having problems with bladder stones and bacterial colonization While I did not experience any UTI symptoms the detritus from the bacteria were so numerous that the whole tube could be clogged by them In addition the cath openings would get clogged by calcareous deposits Even when I ate medicated to keep the pH levels good a size 14 would only last for about 10 days before I had to change it Needless to say this became very tiresome   My experience with the mitrofanoff is very positive I can usually hold 400 500 ml though I usually keep to a routine of cathing every 3 4 hours  I ve been recommended to not surpass 400 ml as a general rule  I usually produce more in the evening than the morning so I guess you should just cath more often first until you learn how your body operates I can feel a tingling sensation in my neck when the capacity is stretched and sometimes if I chug a lot of liquid I might feel it before I usually would I think the more rapid expansion of the bladder might trigger this   As mentioned I have very poor hand control so my assistants do the procedure but it only takes 4 5 minutes and the whole procedure is very easy once learned I have only had slight symptoms of UTIs after getting the mitrofanoff and they never developed further A big bonus when I no longer need a bag is to be able to wear shorts in the summer etc If I am going to a party or similar i simply attach a bag to a cath and don t need to worry about capacity   I do take botox injections in my bladder every 3 months to keep my spastic bladder under control During those procedures it has been confirmed that I do not have any bladder stones so far  they removed 15  before the mitrofanoff procedure   The main  only   negative was the post op period I usually feel absolutely fine after surgeries and this was the case the first two days I was up in my electric chair and visiting my post accidental ward chatting about From the third day however I started vomiting gall and generally felt  terrible it s actually hard to remember exactly what I felt but as I worsened over the next few days I have never in my life felt as bad as that After a while it was discovered that the cause was an elius twisted intestine  a risk with all similar operations  and I was re operated 5 or 6 days after the first operation It took maybe 2 more days before the clog was sorted and I have never been more relieved I lost about 20 lbs and have only now reached my pre op weight Maybe they discovered it late since I couldn t directly feel below my chest It meant I had Christmas at the hospital in 2017 but that is all forgotten now just make sure they check for elius if you start hurling gall etc     Edit  I was slightly distraught with the functionality at first After about a month of letting everything heal the first attempts were very difficult when trying to get the cath in After a while this sorted itself and is not a problem at all anymore The capacity could also be as little as 50 100 ml in the beginning before I would start sensing the tingling  which will be followed by headaches or leakage after a while  This also got better as the bladder got used to being filled again  supra pubis   tiny bladder    TL DR  Very happy with mine in combination with botox bladder treatment   beware of symptoms of elius a few days post op I wish you good luck and I think you will be happy with the results  Anyone have both the Aus and the pump  That sucks You would really think there would be a robotic solution to something as simple as a sphincter by nowI also have a Mitrofanoff   15 years  but the opening has become obstructed by scar tissue and I intermittent cath so everytime I have to urinate it takes longer and longer and becoming more and more painful  5  minutes    That s why I m looking for an alternative It just seems like there should be a way for me in my situation to mostly do away with catheters  Like a small circle with a slot that opens and closes that you can control externally would be completely possible    I m glad you found something that works for you Difficulty breathing when bending down I also have this  Happens to me as well When you fold over like that to tie a shoe or pick something up from the ground you are putting your weight on your lungs  I just wondered why I find it hard now but didn t before Maybe I am pressing down hard without realising I don t know Bowel AccidentsMaybe ask about bulking agents It sounds like your problem might be the stool is too loose and a bulking agent might do the work to shore it up so you have less accidents Or maybe you should switch out to suppositories I use nonstimulant suppositories bit of digistim and sometimes fybrogel  a bulking agent  and haven t had any problems   just because Peristeen works to soften the stool so maybe you might need something to start your process like the stimulant suppository but not necessarily soften to the same extent  I have started eating less and it helped alot Had accidents at least once a week before  Now i eat one small meal a day and try to avoid snacks and other fatty foods I have learned that that queasy feeling for me is usually pressure from GI track that is unable to go down usually because something  large turd or even my seat  is blocking it or it has decided to dump a large amount of fluid from high up If I go sit on the toilet at that point I will often be able to poop and feel much better   Usually the culprits causing it for me are fast food eating too much food  grandma s meals  skipping meals or antibiotics wiping out my good gut bacteria  Have you talked to your primary doctor about this I got referred to a GI specialist and he wanted to rule out anything serious treatable After a colonoscopy and biopsy that was negative he said IBS  Try to avoid stressful situations   lol So do you take fybrogel to harden or soften the stool I googled it and it seems that fybrogel is a laxative I want to have less accidents by maybe making my stool less runny if that makes sense Outlook for my uncle I would worry about getting the broken vertebrae set properly to avoid injuring the spinal cord further Bruising swelling turning into a permanent situation due to improper treatment of my spine fracture is what led to the bone cutting halfway through the spinal cord   Your uncle is in pole position to recover and well He may have a few motor deficits here and there but they may need to wait for some swelling to go down before they can properly evaluate his progress   But do get the bone thing fixed so he can start safe PT ASAP The sooner the better for recovery   I m 26 years on from my injury The technology available today is dizzying If they indicate they may want to do a fusion for the spine ask for the flexible bars one that doesn t completely immobilise your spine Just keep him immobilised for now while the fractures heal are dealt with  Hi I m in a similar situation but 6 months later My dad went into the hospital for sepsis in December it turned into a specific spot of infection in his spine which caused a T5 Injury    x200B   Worry about the damage to the spinal cord because bones can heal nerves can t That being said a bruised spinal cord is an incomplete injury which means the cord wasn t completely severed so some function or sensation is still possible below the injury site  I found this website to be very helpful   https   www christopherreeve org   https   www christopherreeve org      x200B   My sister and I are his only involved family so I understand the overwhelming feeling of become care givers in an instant and mourning for the future you were expecting First thing I would say is continue to visit your uncle and listen to what he has to say The first couple weeks lots of visitors came now in month 6 that number is significantly lower     x200B   Secondly your dad will have a case manager at the hospital This is the person who can help you find information organizations and support in your area for your uncle and his family Your aunt should also be able to call the nursing station and get information about what s going on The nurses know what the doctor has put in the charts and are easier to get a hold of usually Your aunt should also be able to ask that his doctor call her if she has access to his medical info     x200B   Feel free to ask or message me any questions you have After 6 months we have become experts in some topics we had no interest in learning I do not have a SCI but I can help from the family side of things  Also for resources you may want to indicate your general area Each US state has different options Then the U K has a robust social services department that handles OT and carers I don t know how it works in Canada  If the spinal cord is not damaged and only subjected to a strong impact everything will be fine Of course you will have to undergo several operations to replace the vertebral bodies and spend a lot of time on rehabilitation I wish your uncle a speedy recovery  It might take several weeks for swelling of the spinal cord to go down enough for doctors to to determine a diagnosis and do a full assessment of nerve function During the healing process it s common for sensation and movement to better or worsen itself If I m correct and the experimental drug they gave him is meant to slow the onset of paralysis his outlook might be better than if he had gone without it It is very likely too early to tell what life might look like for him from now on Wishing you and your family the best of luck   On a side note please refer your aunt to the Facebook discussion group WAGS of SCI   Wives and Girlfriends of Spinal Cord Injury It s a supportive community of women whose partners have sustained spinal cord injuries Some are full time caregivers to their partners while some have hired outside help It s important that while your aunt is supporting your uncle through this time she feels supported too  And to clarify he didn t fracture only c2 and c6 he fractured 2 3 4 5 and 6    Basically his neck crushed into his back  if that makes sense    It makes enough sense that there ist a medical term for this type injury   https   en wikipedia org wiki Vertebral_compression_fracture     Despite having a broken neck should we be more worried about the spinal cord or the broken c2 c6   Bones heal or they can be at least be fixed with appropriate medical bits of metal The possible issues arising from broken vertebrae are a lot less severe than those from even a slightly damaged spinal cord   Unfortunately the best predictor for neurological recovery is current neurological status The fewer neurological deficiences the patient shows right after the injury the faster and more complete his recovery is likely to be The more neurological functionality  sensation and muscle control below the injury level  your uncle has now the better the outlook for recovery  DamnWho do you use for medical supplies https   www medline com  through a managed healthcare organization   Price check https   www allegromedical com  for retail expenditures  I get mine at Costco 180medical is what I use Edgepark is soo bad They gave me the one box period thing too They also stopped approving his briefs due to not being able to prove he needs them  but we ve been getting them over two years I use 180 medical now and they ve actually been awesome  SportAid com out of Georgia  Discount Prices Fast Shipping No Questions Asked I use Liberator for catheters and lube Until recently I purchased my gloves out of pocket at Sams Costco but this year my new medicare supplement plan  Anthem MediBlue Extra  gives me a  150 every 3 months to spend on over the counter stuff at Walmart  Mckesson Patient Care Solutions renamed to Adapt Health Patient Care solutions as of 2020 Nextra Health  formerly St Louis Medical   Though gloves I still try to snag them from amazon when possible I ran into your same issues recently getting a doctor write a prescription helped for the two months before I started being able to find them on amazon again Although that s probably stupid of me since gloves are so much cheaper with a prescription   Edit  someone else in the thread suggested Costco Their 400 glove packs are certainly ideal Good bang for your buck  Has anyone tried tomorrow health  Also this one eBay for everything else But seriously 180Medical is fantastic Oh and occasionally North Shore Medical for diapers Year and a half post Beginning to notice rounded shoulders and bad posture Check with any PT to develop this  Probably an OT too since it s upper body   All day long pushing a wheelchair you ve been strengthening mostly muscles that flex so now at the end of your day you need to stretch those out and strengthen the ones that extend Your biceps and pecs are monstrous but the little ones between your shoulder blades that expand your chest out and pull your shoulders back have been ignored   I have this old PT that loves to humiliate Wisconsin badger hockey players who think that they are the pinnacle of human achievement She puts them face down on the mat has them extend their arms all the way out they either point their thumbs towards their head or towards the ceiling  I forget  lock elbows and then gives them little 2 5 pound barbells and ask them to do a small set with them To their amazement the little muscles that pull their scapulas together have been ignored in their work out routines and this 60 year old lady can outperform them  I second the other poster s recommendation to see a PT or OT to make sure you have an appropriate exercise program   Also check in with the seating specialist that issued your wheelchair for a seating assessment If your cushion and backrest aren t positioning you properly and giving you the support you need you have no choice but to compensate with a more rounded posture to get stability  Hi Can you use your hands  if so thank God for it and do workouts  Um  Is the PT Barb or Judy by chance Do you have any recommendations on how to stretch those muscles and work out the others Awkward questionProbably not sadly   Something I ll warn you about  my doctor didn t  is that it takes about a week for the Botox to work and your capacity will probably be reduced for a day or two  A little frightening when it happens but it s temporary  Interesting Because they descend from the abdomen testes innervation is from higher in the spinal cord around T10 L2 so you might have some sensation at least to T10  Eh I m supposed to be a T5 complete and I ve been able to feel my testicles getting knocked around for most of the duration of my injury  I m surprised they let you do it without anesthesia I ve had a botox injection into my bladder done twice and they won t let me get it done without anesthesia I m t10 complete I don t know why because I can t feel anything below my belly button This is normal The testicular and anal regions are best equipped with nerve endings so you can feel them To increase sensitivity you can do training using the Buteyko method   this also activates the nervous transmission in the legs Do not forget about leg training do it for 3 5 hours a day Start with the coach and then do everything yourself Gradually everything will recover I wish you to be strong and persistent on this path  Thanks I was wondering about that because I feel like I m always full but I ve got meds for a week or so Thread necromancy question since you know about botox injection It s been almost 2 weeks and I don t know if it s a result of the injections or coming off meds but my spasticity has been crazy and my capacity has stayed at like half it was before I have a follow up with my doctor in a week but this is annoying and I m not sure if I should keep waiting it out or if this is normal Ain t that a bitch you can feel your testicles getting hurt but you can t feel any pleasure Valsalva I used to do this as well but found out valsalva is not recommended as it can lead to bladder and kidney damage over time as well as increased risk of heart disease complications  Three Times a day No wonder you leak in between  I go five times and that can be a little too little  Like others have said this isn t a good idea as it can cause damage  3 times is way too low T10 complete here for 10 yrs and I do it according to fluid intake and weather in my city If it s too hot going upto 37 38 degree Celsius I do it twice or thrice with no leaks When temperatures go down to around 22 23 degree Celsius I do it almost every 2 5hrs Fluid intake also reduces When I go drinking I do it every hour Leaks happen when the temperature takes a dip in the city In my opinion we need to understand our body system a lot to know what works for us Trying out multiple methods timings  I did this for a few years at the start but have since switched to intermittent catheterization on advice of my urologist There are trade offs both ways but in general the catheterization is much less stressful  Usually many people with spinal injuries use the method of tapping and pressing on the bladder This is also not a good way out but still better than a f      ng catheter  Hey partner com on you gotta relax Don t force it or you re gonna blow out your o ring   https   youtu be BDTUM7qjKTI We re still figuring out what s best for me with my urologist Currently he has me cathing but only after I urinate which I believe is so my bladder is trained to empty itself better I can urinate large quantities  100 200CCs  I just don t empty completely Of course the downside is that I can t hold it in and have to wear a diaper wherever I go This is sickening Yeah to be honest I haven t gotten a speeding ticket since I was paralyzed I get pulled over cop walks up asks for DL insurance Sees chair in passenger seat and hand controls and I get a warning  This is horrendous He could have suffered a bone break when he fell  Jesus   Civil suit would be easy for me I already won a large judgement so I d want them fired with the stipulation they could never be a cop again  While I agree this is poor and unjustified behavior on the part of the officers there s two important things to remember   1  This was 2 years ago and not related in any way to the George Floyd incident  2  We have no idea what the context is here or what happened before the camera started rolling  Could have very easily died from AD Also nice username Regarding point 1  My understanding of the current protests is they are about the long history of abuse by police officers against the vulnerable And by vulnerable I mean any person that is being abused by a police officer   And point 2  we do know at least 2 heavily armed officers chose to drag a disabled person out of a car and onto the ground Is it normal practice to physically pull someone suspected of having a weapon out of the car They chose a violent dangerous and humiliating method to carry out their duties I would contend that irrespective of what happened prior to the incident this was totally unwarranted   These are my opinions but as you rightly say we weren t there we don t know I know your tongue might be one of the only typically functioning parts of your body but you don t have to use it to lick the police s boots 24 7 My storyHow did the driver die Did they not stop at the crosswalk or were u not supposed to cross Hope ur doing well DON t worry you have your whole life ahead of you  Train a lot develop yourself and everything will improve    I was walking home from school with my mother and I got hit by a car on the crosswalk The driver later died in the hospital   Whoa Usually I get angry when I hea that someone caused an accident that turned a bystander into a paraplegic and yet barely got as much as a scratch but that s a bit much  I m sorry you had to go through that are you okay right now  That is a horrific story but I m really glad you re still here today I can t imagine what it s like to have an SCI but I do have chronic physical and mental illnesses  gastroparesis IBS ADHD depression and anxiety  that has made life interesting As hard as it can be life goes on and if you feel particularly down or need someone to talk to my DMs are always open You still have a lot of life ahead of you  Hey t11 incomplete aswell How are you The light was green for us but that car was coming at a very high speed When it hit me I was sliding 3 meters on asphalt and the car crashed into a nearby tree killing the driver on impact I m doing well thanks for asking My depression is kind of preventing me from improving but I do train a lotyeah it s crazyyes I m doing goodAmputation with SCI Kinda in the same wheelhouse I use leg braces as an L1 complete A big thing is going to be balance but the most important thing is going to be being hyper aware for skin issues around the prosthetic especially if you re losing the foot because of skin issues You and your prosthetist should have a really good working relationship and you should be able to get Appointments for adjustments easily  Don t get discouraged if it takes awhile to get the fit or if they have to start over This kind of stuff is just like wheelchairs in that there is no  standard size  only  obnoxiously custom    I hoe whatever happens you get some relief from the pain  I just had a right leg above the knee amputation for severe non healing wounds and worries about lingering infection causing system wide terrible So far I find life a bit easier But I have no muscle control so I ll never get the chance to walk  I think you should try your damnedest to get out there and walk as best you can and show that doctor he doesn t know everything  Yeah I agree I ve since been really trying to get more comfortable with weight bareing on my right leg but it will take some practice I thinkDid you find any healing issues with reduced blood flow etc How long is a cushion supposed to last Your cushion won t last 5 years Each person is different but mine can break in with impressions with in a few months It just depends on how much you can tolerate and your finances for replacing  I d check with the cushion manufacturer Some of those have a lifetime guarantee The frame of my backrest broke so I contacted the manufacturer The chair was over 5 years old They contacted the DME provider and replaced it immediately I ve never replaced a cushion though I ve had them wear out but they were still functional so I never bothered checking But it s worth looking into   Also I d suggest loosening up the axle pipe and nudging out the camber tubes that hold the wheels Not a ton so it doesn t make it hard to get through doors but just a little to relieve the rubbing on your jeans  It depends on your insurance tbh I think I get a new one covered every year definitely see if your PCP will push for necessary replacements What type of cushion Is it a solid material  like a foam  or does is have bladders  usually filled with air sometimes with gel   That compression is from transferring I have gone through 3 roho hybrid elites in the past 10 years pretty much for the same reason I put my left hand on the cushion getting in an out of the car and toilet After a while you just push it down  I have a J2 cushion The gel part in the butt area works really well for about 3 4 months and then needs replacing around the year mark  My brother has a ROHO cushion for both of his chairs He has a manual and electric He s had them both for 7 years now without any problems so far  I change my Supracore  thickest one  every two years  It s a jay fusion that s mainly foam but has a jell area for the butt Trying to find new medical supplier deleted  180medical I think is the name  Didn t think after that thanksThanks I ll look into itI use them they have good customer service Is it possible to regain lost muscle mass below the level of your injury If so how Yes I m an incomplete para Was primarily in a wheelchair post injury and now I walk with crutches and can take some steps independently It s all about finding the right rehab The activity based physical rehab model has been tremendously helpful Where do you live The first place like this I went to was CORE in Northridge CA I worked with Taylor for about 10 years His first client  now business partner  is a quad who is able to walk a bit with canes and does a lot of cool active sports stuff Most recently I ve worked with Jeff Lefkovitz at Abilities Recovery Center and prior to that I worked out at Project Walk   Send me a DM if you d like I m very familiar with good rehab places in the los angeles area  I m sure I could point you in the right direction if you re somewhere else as well Hit me up  I m a c5 quadriplegic since 2008 Sadly my answer is negative You can do stuff for maintenance but you won t grow mass  Depends Complete injury or incomplete  Can t really strengthen muscles that you can t activate  FES can be used to maintain muscle bulk  Check out Carson Tueller and Craig Dennis on Instagram  They both use FES and have increased the bulk in their thigh muscles Carson is a C8 quad  I know interesting right   and I think Craig Dennis is a T10 11 para    how do you stay motivated to exercise regularly  move your legs and stuff  knowing you won t be making any substantial gains   By knowing that if you don t exercise whatever you have left will deteriorate even further  Physical Therapist here  The main benefits of exercise in the lower limb is to promote healthy circulation and maintaining range of motion  If you lose range in the ankles for instance and develop severe drop foot it can be very difficult to even sit in a wheelchair with feet on footrest  Thats just an example of one potential issue that could arise  The purpose is really to ensure better quality of life  Pressure sores maintaining regular bowel movements UTI s dysreflexia episodes etc are already a headache enough so you don t want another problem to deal with  I am not sure nor have I heard or seen anyone in my circle gaining muscle mass Ideally if one uses sports as rehab or uses sports components for fitness muscle mass loss is delayed but it is inevitable I am a t10 complete for close to 10yrs and saw sudden muscle loss after 7 yrs primarily due to lifestyle choices around that time When I started to focus on sports it did slow down  things like FES bikes probably Thanks I ll be sending you a DM I will Thanks According to you how often should one exercise stretch  deleted Thanks for responding How do you engage those particular muscles even when you use sports for fitness It would be great to know if it has actually helped anybody with that I am under the impression that it s more for maintenance Hey Wheel fam Tried fishing for the first time yesterday since my accident It wasn t easy but really fun Anyone else like to fish or hunt I grew up in a rural area where fishing and hunting were pretty common And I m close to my grandfather who is big into both I was paralyzed when I was 13 Prior to that I had really only been pheasant and duck hunting I did go deer hunting for a few years after being paralyzed As I got older and went away to college I kinda stopped I may apply for a deer tag this year Deadline to get it in is tomorrow so I ll have to decide soon I don t fish very regularly but I get out on the water from time to time During the summer my grandfather gets his boat out on the water every chance he gets So I ll probably get back out there sometime in the coming months Covid might make that a bit harder so we ll see  Nichi Nicki is an expert worm handler Marry that girl  But seriously  I live on a lake and would fish daily Unfortunately is down stairs Someone donated a lift for me to get down I just need it installed By end of summer ill be back Before my accident I had a friend ergo was a quad He had a John boat that

spends a lot of time with my friends  kids    I have a hard time running after toddlers  so I tend to cordon off a small area of the house while I m watching them      I can do stairs ok if it s just me  but not while holding a kid  If the kid is too young to crawl  I put them on my lap and butt scoot on the stairs  If they are old enough to manage stairs  they go up first  or down last   and I crawl up behind them keeping a hand in their back to make sure they are steady and safe     Playing on the ground or while standing is hard so I like playing on a sofa or bed      I brace my arms on counters or other furniture while I m holding kids to increase the time I can do so comfortably      I organize the environment to limit having to carry kids if they are not crawling yet  Like having as much as possible within reach     I don t have access to these things at my friends  houses  but if I have kids I ll definitely get adapted furniture       When out and about  I don t use a stroller  I am the stroller  Haha Between this and wheelchair basketball  I m pretty good at wheeling one handed  If I have kids  I ll probably fashion some kind of safety buckle or wear the little one so I can have both hands free       My friends in OT school made a really cool adapted sling with a sturdy base so a client with weak arms could safely hold their newborn grandson      One thing to mention is the prejudice against me being a percieved parent  When buying baby clothes or toys I get a lot of  you don t have kids  do you    These aren t for you  right    These are for your friend Oh that s good   And lots of incredulous looks from strangers  None of these things happen when I m not using my chair  So one important adaptation is blinders and a thick skin  Hi I m also an

insta handle is  brittanyfisherfrank  You should check out  Roll with Cole   Charisma  https   www youtube com watch v gKTYbf5ilUw  on YouTube   Also a couple quick resources worth checking out      The Christopher Reeve Foundation   https   www christopherreeve org      Swim with Mike  https   www swimwithmike org      AbleGamers  https   ablegamers org      SCI Support Group  https   www facebook com groups SCPSUSA learning_content    EDIT  Oops totally misread Thought you said  parenting someone with a SCI   My bad I think there s a quadriplegic dad with a YouTube Facebook page but I can t find it  L1 injury which occurred In July of 2019 my daughter was born on Christmas Day 2019 It s been a roller coaster of adapting and I now take care of the baby house full time while I recover and get ready to work again   My take everything is hilariously expensive unless you have the skills   resources to make some things yourself The day to day is difficult but not impossible I wish we could afford a crib that I could safely get her out of or a stroller attachment to the wheelchair or the means to adapt our vehicle so I could take her somewhere by myself   My wife and I live about 4K miles from our nearest relatives so it s been forced adaption to make it through It s rewarding but I sometimes still have break downs when I think about all the things I ll never get to experience with my daughter  teaching her to ride a bike to ski hiking with my daughter exploring nature with my daughter etc Another trigger is the thought that I may become embarrassing for her because of the injury not just because I m a weirdo It really is heartbreaking and I try to tell myself I can just do it differently but it s a lie My life is measurably shittier because of this and I wish it never happened everyday   Still I love my daughter and in any other circumstance I would not have this time with her and for that I am grateful but it s a really shitty long term trade  Thank you for taking the time to share all this stuff It s very informative and helpful You re great Are you an OT with an SCI too  Never met one of our kind before Has anyone had the epidural stimulator implant L3  I think Been decades since I saw a neurologist  here I m totally with you Don t give a shit if I walk again but some sensation so I can avoid hurting myself or gain some plumbing control would improve my life so much Just a smidge more independence y know   I just wonder about whether I d even be a candidate since I have a full spinal fusion I don t exactly relish the thought of drills around my spinal cord so they can gain access    ah well  C2 to C6 here I would love to try this It looks very promising and like you it seems more likely to improve quality of life as opposed to guarantying someone would  walk  again  Definitely looks interesting And I would never complain about another trip to Thailand   I met a young lady during a rehab stay a while back who had an spinal epidural stimulator implanted She was a para for unknown reasons Her primary struggle though were severe neuropathic pain Beyond my imagination based on her descriptions of her situation before the stimulator Which I had no reason not to believe   Long story short the stimulator worked for her It had changed her life completely according to herself It seemed easy to operate too  she had a remote on her person at all times which she could adjust the electric impulse intervals strength of the impulses and so on And its batteries were charged through induction or magnetism or something She just attached the charger to her lower back where the stimulator were placed under her skin   In regards to help with regaining motor function or bowel function etc I have no idea But I thought that my  second hand experience  was worth mentioning because it goes to tell that this technology is more than just a gimmick  My husband was gonna get one put in but since he s on eliquis They said no How is Thailand as far as accessibility I want to go feed the elephants Thanks Was he going to this location I m curious what the cost is Did they give you a number Frequent UTI s There are some people that have to be placed on a low dose Bactrim daily for life due to chronic UTIs Here are some other  home  remedies that may help you    Drink Plenty of Fluids  Drinking plenty of liquids can decrease the risk of UTIs by making you pee more which helps remove bacteria from the urinary tract   Increase Vitamin C Intake  Increasing vitamin C intake may decrease the risk of UTIs by making the urine more acidic thus killing off infection causing bacteria   Drink Unsweetened Cranberry Juice  Some studies show that cranberries could help reduce the risk of urinary tract infections by preventing bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract   Take a Probiotic  Probiotics could help prevent UTIs when used alone or in combination with antibiotics   Try These Natural Supplements  check with your physician or pharmacist regarding any negative reactions of supplements with your prescription medications    Here are a few supplements that have been studied   D Mannose  This is a type of sugar that is found in cranberries and has been shown to be effective in treating UTIs and preventing recurrence   Bearberry leaf  Also known as uva ursi One study showed that a combination of bearberry leaf dandelion root and dandelion leaf decreased UTI recurrence   Cranberry extract  Like cranberry juice cranberry extract works by preventing bacteria from adhering to the urinary tract   Garlic extract  Garlic has been shown to have antimicrobial properties and may be able to block the growth of bacteria to prevent UTIs It might seem weird but cranberry pills are actually what urologists recommend to prevent UTIs Vitamin C can also help If you catheterise it is important that you have clean hands and a sterile working environment  Cranberry pills have helped me a lot  My friend dissolves the mannose d pill into cranberry juice and takes his morning pills with that It works  Mannose is from cranberries he said  I ve been on 50mg nitrofurantoin at bedtime for roughly 8 years I know an antibiotic everyday isn t great but it s been working really well for me  Don t eat as much sugar and take a gulp of apple cider vinegar Honestly the best thing you can do is drink drink and drink water Staying hydrated helps flush out bacteria that gets into the bladder and urinate tract I also take the Mannose pills I believe that it helps I ll link what I take below They are pretty cheap I take three at once during the day The next thing is your cath method Can you provide more info Are you a male or female What type of catheter are you using Might be able to offer more suggestions with that info I had issues for quite a while too but now I m down to no more than one to two a year    NOW Supplements D Mannose 500 mg Non GMO Project Verified Healthy Urinary Tract  120 Veg Capsules https   www amazon com dp B000JN4CR0 ref cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_Qwn0EbSFTEZDK I used to get them often Hiprex tablets were a great thing for me I know its tedious but changing my bed linen every day instead of every 2   3 days made a big difference Fyi dont take hiprex and cranberry tablets togethet Hyptex with 500 MG of Vitamin C every 12 hours   you will eliminate a LOT of UTI s This stops bacteria from multiplying so you don t become symptomatic  Completely different approach for me getting Botox seems to keep UTI s at bay for me I think that the issue I have is that even a very mild UTI causes bladder spasms in me and the botox helps fight the spasms I used to get tested and go on antibiotics 6 10 years a year before botox   I ve been tested for UTIs twice in the last 3 years Once when I had a decently bad one and once when my botox was wearing off  All tests the second time came back negative but I had many of the signs of a UTI including leaking as frequently as every 15 minutes  Ask your urologist about going on a bladder flushing regime You do low dose oral antibiotics most of the time flush your bladder with plain saline every night Then for one week a month the urologist used to prescribe me a little super concentrated liquid antibiotic you put into the saline that you infused into the bladder and left there for a couple of hours I did really well with that   Shame nobody where I am right now seems to know what I m talking about       Oh FYI to everyone Cranberry juice is the most effective because it has the most mannose content but if you re in a pinch and can only find lingonberry juice   it works too I guess I live in a weird part of town if I can find lingonberry more easily than cranberry   I ve heard drinking corn silk tea helps  I ve been drinking at least 90 oz of water a day and I take Methanamine and Vitamin C 2 times a day  a friend and I are both C3 quads with SPTs and we have had great luck with Methenamine  I was doing really well for years only getting 1 UTI per year or so But the past 6 months have been constant UTIs Within a week of being off antibiotics I would get another one My doctor finally prescribed me Nitrofurantoin Its an antibiotic that I take once per day before bed I really don t want to be on them forever but I can t take the UTIs anymore Might try getting off them in a few months or something Hope you get it figured out   deleted Thanks I will ask my doc about it supra pubic catheter question do you still have leakage via urethra penis Not unless it gets block or you have bladder spasms I ve only had leaking when the catheter got clogged or I got a UTI  I ve recently lost all sensation from the hip down due to spinal cord compression at L1 2 I ve had a catheter now for a few weeks and there are no leaks or anything bad They work really well and it s really nothing when they put it in it sounds horrific someone putting a tube up your dickhole but it s pretty much painless  I have never had a regular catheter as my entire urethra was destroyed during my accident What I can tell you from having a suprapubic catheter for over a year now is that it has been a rollercoaster of learning I ve learned everything from how my body reacts to different materials to how to tell when I have a UTI Because up until recently we kept using the wrong kind of catheter for me  everyone s body reacts differently  it used to be very very painful when they would remove one to insert another Now it is painless and no big deal at all Most of the time I can t tell that I even have a catheter other than sometimes when I move my drain bag I can feel the pressure in the line go up and down I have a personal preference for using night bags  2000ml  at all times and have never used a leg bag This is because I use a wheelchair for mobility 98  of the time so it s just more convenient to have a bigger bag that I can just Clio to the wheelchair  Thanks for all your responses guys Just recently I developed an adhesive allergy so I had to switch to using a penile catheter Just today it blocked went dysreflexic got it changed by RN couple of hours later block again then went dysreflexic again Had enough of this type of catheter now Follow up question how much do you leak  are we talking drips or more of a flow how do you manage the leakage pads towels or similar  My brother still has a fistula from under his testicles It s actually kind of a godsend for the time when his catheter backs up at change time and the urine has no other place to go So it goes out the fistula That way he still gets some relief He s had his Supra pubic for about 5 years now I think  This was the case for my husband when he still had his  his bladder function came back  He had no idea he had a UTI just a bit of fatigue and nausea plus an on again off again low fever so he had it for way too long It was miserable but definitely a learning experience  Suprapubic catheter  like OP is talking about  goes through a hole in the abdomen My brother using the anti reflux 2000 overnight bags Has never used the leg bag He can always feel the pressure of the line moving or getting hit or even if it is getting backed up in the line For me it s usually enough to wet my pants but not enough to reach my wheelchair cushion Since it s pretty contained I usually don t realize until that night when I m transferring back to bed After that I ll usually wear briefs diapers for the next few days until I figure out what s going on and everything is back to normal Thank you for the response Aunt with T8I am a T8 she should be able to do her own bowel care As for showering if the door is big enough to get into and she has access to a bathroom with a tub and shower wand With one of these  Moen Non Slip Adjustable Transfer  https   www amazon com dp B002KMTB1U ref ppx_pop_mob_ap_share  She can shower in the tub  Hmmm     Hi thank you for the link She s always had help with her bowel care and gets someone in everyday to help I don t know if it could be because she s older  late 40 s   early 50 s  or because she is  larger  although she does weigh less then me    unfortunately the shower barely reaches the bath tub and she would need to lean to reach which in my head she would fall off if she had a chair and it would be very dangerous because the bathroom hasn t got much space for her chair to move freely the shower itself would be a no go because of how small and the shape of itMy story   advice neededWell how are your erections You ll probably need viagra or another enhancer Roman com is pretty quick and easy but not very cheap so I now use pills from India for a 10th of the price T 10 complete here I have to use sildenafil and plenty of lubes to maintain an erection for penetrative sex Check out the intimate rider My wife and I got one a couple years post sci but we dont use it all that much because I ve gotten to be quite the cunning linguist and she prefers that now Also no setup of equipment for oral  I sometimes get pretty good reflex erections but I ll check those out Thanks I am planning on buying a sex wedge Do you have any experience with those Accessible homeI m currently looking for a house to buy and it s so damn hard to find anything that would work I pretty much automatically rule out any split level homes or something with a second story There s a good number of ramblers with basements but it s sometimes a question of whether or not the bathrooms and some of the doorways are wide enough Aside from making sure doors are wide enough I don t really need any special modifications aside from a way to get downstairs into a basement I m very independent outside of that   But I need space I don t really want anything under 2500 square feet I have a wife and daughter and we plan on having at least one more kid I d also like an attached garage so I don t have to deal with snow in the morning when getting the kid out to the car and into their car seat in the winter And a decent sized garage at that as I also do some woodwork   If I could walk I could find houses that meet these specifications all day every day for a decent price Since I can t walk the majority of houses get ruled out pretty quickly   I d love to have a custom home built but the housing market here is ridiculously expensive for the area and so are the lots I m looking to spend  300 000 at most Unfortunately that doesn t get you much I m this area   I d love to hear what other people have done when getting into owning a home  It s just my husband and I  and our pets  so we didn t need anything huge We did however need something quick because we were living in a 3 story townhouse when he was injured After striking out with existing houses on the market I found a new construction neighborhood that allowed modifications to their floorplans The houses are pretty cookie cutter but it suited our needs   Some things like moving doorways or light switches were free Others like concrete ramps and wider doors were extra The faux wood vinyl flooring with zero thresholds required the upgraded package but that was fine because I like the cabinets and faucets better anyway   It s not the way we wanted to buy our first house and probably not what we would have chosen if we d had more time and or money but it works and we re mostly happy with it   Edit  The biggest problem was just waiting on it to be built The frame was up when we signed the contract but they had to modify it to make the changes we requested We spent a couple months in a hotel after he was released from rehab   Edit 2  There is one room my husband can t get into at the moment   the guest bath It was simply impossible without making MAJOR changes to wall placements which couldn t happen since the frame was already up But the master bath is accessible  https   www newmobility com 2019 07 hacking a home   Kind of an interesting way to go about it on a small budget Probably depends on your areas zoning and codes  My family remodeled a home for my brother after his accident That will be 7 years ago in August He s now C5 C6 incomplete quad  I hear ya  I do currently live in an accessible  enough  home I live alone and I m largely independent It suits me just fine and I don t have any issues on the regular But I m thinking in the future when things will get harder  because our bodies don t get better with age that s for sure    I m looking towards the nice to have in my future Accessible kitchen so cooking is easier A larger bathroom so I don t scuff everything up and have an easier time getting in and out Just more space in general to move around so I m not constantly bumping into shit  But all these things aren t usually custom in homes and renovating is so restrictively expensive It s far cheaper just to build from scratch I am told I just don t know what that price tag is Thank you for this In 201  I became quadriplegic and lost the will to live Now I m on YouTube sharing my story Here my third video on how Queen B  Beyonc   saved my life Thanks for following along You are the best thing ever I have a Beyonc  too It s not Beyonc   but god yes I GET IT she is amaaaazinnng  The power of music to get us all through the shit we have in life really defies explanation doesn t it The duo that has powered me through my shit is not a pair that s mainstream but damn I can t describe to anyone how much they mean to me and how fiercely protective I feel over them I feel that music to my core and can remember specific instances when their songs have saved me   Anyway I wonder from watching this what Queen B would think about you I bet she would be in awe of your strength your perseverance your beauty We are all working it in our own way aren t we   I sure hope she sees this one day not for you but for her  Stay strong    Awesome I became a quadriplegic in 97 I ve been posting streaming on myself gaming and chatting with people on YouTube for a few years I ve been recently thinking about doing more videos about my injury and how it affected my life over the last 23 years I definitely think more people with disabilities should share their stories on any platform they can The more exposure we get the more acceptance we get It ll break down the stereotypes and tropes of what a disabled person is I won t post a link here I don t want to take away from what you re doing Rock on  Aww you re so sweet So who are your Beyonc s  Agreed music is incredible It has monumentally shaped me in my life and continues to be my antidepressant No matter what life throws at you there is music that can help I think that s beautiful Yes I agree It wasn t long ago that I had no idea what a paralyzed person went through We have to normalize our existence to those that don t understand so humanity can be more accepting and understanding  and grateful they can walk   There s currently so many stigmas that have not helped me since my injury   You are more than welcome to share your links here the more the merrier Retaining a lot of fluid in legsMy physiatrist said that this happens often to people with spinal cord issues She thought that for me it was due to that and compounded by having severe spasticity because the tightness can affect blood flow and fluid drainage   I have compression stockings prescribed and they help quite a bit You can get them OTC as well I ve found that the ones rated 30 40 mmhg are most effective Put them on in the morning while your legs are still horizontal and level with the rest of your body for the best effect  Buy a pair of  JUZOs  http   www juzousa com Products Stockings for Circulation  The compression stocking are a must but you can also raise the foot of your bed an inch higher than the head or get some pillows to elevate your feet every night I also have a recliner that I use every day so I can put my feet up  A little update fro everyone I went out and bought a pair of 20 30  they were out of 30 40  However holy shit was it hard to get on I ripped one already then decided to read the little card They still are ok for now it was minor I appreciate everyone s feedback and I have a great respect for everyone here  I wish I could get a pair on   Getting your legs above your heart for 15 minutes is beneficial  MY left legs is too far gone   When swelling gets up to your knee  then other problems occur  I had the same problem with swelling although I have a much more severe injury Compression stockings greatly improved my swelling It was such a simple fix  no meds required  and yes wear them all day or at least when you re up moving around Hope your swelling goes down   I get mine from

two weeks I ve started driving with hand controls that I installed onto my vehicle pretty easily It didn t require any changes to the vehicle itself and the controls were pretty affordable However this is what worked for me because my injury level was rather low and it might not work for you I ll link the one I bought and there are various YouTube videos of them in use I hope you can find an affordable solution Best of luck to you   https   www amazon com dp B07RHSWDT9  T2 t3 I got a settlement and vehicles every 5 years was part of it  Oh wow That has to make circumstances a bit easier

What do you guys drive  Anyone else into modding cars at all You left out the most important part the actual transfer and getting the chair in after   Well done The ability to drive is so important able bodied people don t understand  This was an enjoyable video Thank you   I never thought about a quad s inability to move the shifter and I loved your solution   Where do you get a tri spinner That looks really comfortable I hate the little knob it hurts my hands  How do you load the chair  Hey mate Awesome work Agreed that being able to drive is really underrated   Building the strength and dexterity to be able to transfer in and out and adjust to the change in driving style is really valuable too   Were there any exercises you did to make sure you had the mobility to be able to transfer and drive  Will be in one of my upcoming videos It would have been too long to explain both in depth Agreed Probably the best thing I ve re learned post injury I ll be posting a video about that in a few weeks It would have been too long to have everything in one video and still be able to explain it properly I use quad release axels and break my chair down Seat Cushion HelpI am a C6 but

SurgeryEmployer healthcare is United so no catheters  I used cure catheters from allegro medical Was about 300 a month  You could try working with your company and see if they can compensate you for the expense If it was covered by your previous insurance you could try to make an argument for an increase in compensation to make up for your out of pocket cost increase   My company is switching to United next year and I m going to try this tactic if catheters aren t covered  I reuse catheters without any issues I rinse them before and after each use and I can get weeks out of them  Why not use the marketplace I have found that many times the price is not that different when purchasing directly Insurance adds unnecessary costs You just need your doctor s prescription Let me know if you need more information Like this is something even I went through  deleted  And if it says it doesn t you can send in paperwork to fill a room they won t cover it The fact your united plan does cover them is the more unusual situation I think  For how many  If I were an established employee instead of brand new and it weren t for the corona belt tightening maybe  I have talked to HR about making it a consideration the next time the company contract comes up and if at that point they don t I would definitely make it a point for increased compensation  I use 180medical for mine and they are a good company I have a massive surplus of catheters too if you can t figures something out lmk I might be able to just give you some I only use 1 3 a day so 1 box lasts me like 2 weeks and I get 10 boxes

bettymills com For how many You really shouldn t be doing that its super risky I meant I can t buy a government marketplace plan as having an employer offered one disqualifies you With my current insurance I haven t paid for a catheter in years The specific plan probably doesn t cover it Some United plans do some don t It s super stupidOften times your physician can write an appeal to get them covered even when the plan does not cover the needed items In the long run United doesn t want pay for the negative health consequences of you not having the needed products   Work with your urologist or other prescribing physician they can often connect you with their vendor rep to help get you the supplies at a reasonable cost   Finally many companies are self funded for healthcare costs A

on feet while walkingI wear thick merino wool socks which helps a lot I was lucky enough to have the orthotist be in the same facility as my outpatient therapy He remolded where there was too much contact and added padding Made a huge difference  Check with your brace folks They re really ingenious and can work with you on what you need and give you suggestions as they ve seen it all  They can add extra padding give you extra room in the molding etc They can also give you foam spacer  pringles  to place between your feet and braces shoes Their expertise and creativity when working with me on what I needed was really invaluable   I had to go to a specialty shoe store and get fitted for shoes  extra wide size to fit the braces    Fitting checks are usually free   I also wear thick socks when I m gonna be walking a lot  or wear double thin socks if I haven t done laundry      Be sure to check your feet regularly especially if you have any spotty or limited sensation   I ve used hypericum and calendula cream  Amazon  on blisters sores and the like Good for healing   Good luck  Oh yes I ve always worn Merino socks because my feet sweat and stink like crazy  I got some Merino

motivate my c5 brother to do his PT at home during this hellstorm Honestly what helped me out was understanding the consequences of not doing my PT  then I could make an informed decision about what I wanted to could focus on I don t think anyone outside could give me the motivation to do stuff but what I do wish someone would do is just be empathetic to the fact everything s changed and instead of push me on doing stuff actually talk to me about why I didn t want to do it and what I felt   My C5 6 was also last August and my major barrier with motivation was and is always psychological and what has helped me out is A  understanding what happens if I don t do PT and b  someone actually having a conversation with me about what I feel about my injury because just getting that emotion out can allow for much clearer thinking after  I m c7 and haven t been to PT in two mo this and have been too depressed to try at home Abut I m starting to realize I m kicking myself in the head for not doing it Thanks so much I m really trying to help but am basically clueless about what to do I m learning as much as I can about his specific injury but I really haven t talked to him about that so I m really grateful for the suggestion  Hey mate There s a team out of Sydney called Maslow that focus on making in home rehab fun and accessible for people with a spinal cord injury Shoot me a pm I d recommend getting in touch with them Invest in equipment to use at home that doesn t require much heavy assistance Rather than me explaining check out my videos and you will see some of the stuff he can use  This is spot on and why I don t wanna be pushy I think on a scientific level he knows what happens if he doesn t keep up on it but it hasn t HIT home that he s shooting himself in the foot  no pun intended  by not doing it I ve been gently suggesting him finding someone to talk to but he s pretty resistant to that thanks to our upbringing being very SUCK IT UP I ve been bringing my kid by to hang out and play catch the stuffed animal which at least helps a little both mentally and physically He s one of my best friends and I just wanna help the best I can Http   maslow io is their

Thanks again Catheter Changes  That s no fun mate I m sorry I can be much help only to say that hopefully it will become painless in the future Mine are fine so i have my fingers crossed for you   deleted  All these surveys kinda get old personally They never seen to bring about change only serve to remind the cripples to stay in their lane I kind of hope to just lose all feeling i have there eventually lol I mean its not helping at all to feel anything there No my urethra was destroyed during my accident I was run over by a pickup truck and it distracted my urethra and took away all feeling in that region and parts of my legs I don t have enough urethra left to reconstruct  they tried twice I don t understand what you mean Spinal Cord Stimulator for Chronic Pain I m a postdoc researching epidural spinal cord stimulation in persons with SCI  also in SCI animal models  You didn t ask for it but if you want information in that perspective I d be glad to give it  I d like to hear about this too I m barely functioning and am maxed out on meds  I got a Boston Scientific SCS for chronic pain implemented 2 years ago and it literally changed my life I would say I get 80  pain reduction Happy to answer further questions  I got it literally 4 days ago It s has decreased my spasms by about 80  and some nerve pain It s hard to say how much because the spasms and that pain were almost blocking a lot of nerve pain so with the spasms gone the nerve pain is worse than before the shot but better than before I started getting spasms of that makes sense Obviously no idea how long it will last but I m not sure if it s the same thing as an epidural shot  Very welcome In an odd way it s good to hear from others what they re doing for pain because a lot of the people with SCIs that I know don t deal with much or it s totally controlled with meds  I m an L1 incomplete para too  4 years post injury   Weirdly enough the thing that helped my nerve pain the most was calcium Apparently nerves  and muscles  desperately need calcium in order to function properly If I regularly take calcium supplements my nerve pain is diminished by 95   Thank you for your response   My pain doc mentioned a possibility of an epidural shot in my spine to reduce possible swelling that would relieve pressure on nerves and relieve pain It didn t sound like that would work for my pain since the location is so specific doesn t move and doesn t change on position or activity level But is that the treatment you meant I would love to hear your thoughts I would definitely like to hear more about it both for pain reduction and possible rebuilding of pathways I m currently maxed out on pain meds and I m still in excruciating nerve pain so any information would be helpfulThat s awesome Thank you for the response   What does 80  pain reduction look like You still get pain but it s less intense Less frequent Is it bearable Thank you for that info and all your help I look forward to giving it a shot Mother has recently became a paraplegic need advice help Get her a personal care assistant for at least the first 4 months I am 55  a T8 and am totally self sufficient Your mom can get there but will need some help and rehab is too short these days to learn everything You or your dad shouldn t be her caregiver if at all possible    I had insurance paid for a couple months then I paid another month out of pocket after that I was able to do everything myself As a para she would only need a couple hours three times a week I paid the PCA 20 bucks an hour so it was 120 a week and to be blunt that is a bargain to not have to help your mom go to the bathroom   Google bowel program if you want details  Depending on where you live see what support agencies trusts associations and governmental assistance are available for that particular diagnosis based on their injury level  s  not just on a name Be pushy if necessary and good luck  I am the caretaker for my husband who uses a wheelchair  It was helpful to get remote controlled items such as lights fans game consoles etc  and wheeled tables trays and carts so she can control her environment from where she is as much as possible  It s extremely hard to lose so much control of your life in every way so always be patient with her  She might get extra controlling about having things done a certain way just go with it  I m sure her doctors will give you all a lot of instructions and DEFINITELY get home health care  hopefully insurance will cover it   One thing to be to make a top priority is preventing pressure sores   those can wreak havoc and cause all kinds of problems and pain  Please make sure you and your stepdad and all her caretakers take this very seriously and make it a priority to reposition her continiously  I am the partner of someone who is tetraplegic Full transparency Covid 19 has made things difficult It s been difficult to find caregivers some caregivers have reduced hours for their own health personal reasons and others are stretched thin making up for coverage My partner moved out of his house and in with his mom because his roommates were unable to social distance His house and my house currently have a social distancing and grocery shopping closed loop system i e  we don t see other people without masks ever and will take turns buying groceries for each other to reduce everyone s public exposure I help my partner every weekend but he s lucky to have his mom for most of the support I would coordinate with your stepdad to see if you can explicitly develop a secure safe support system for the indefinite future of the pandemic   Further my city has a couple of mutual aid groups that also offer assistance with groceries I would do some research and see if there s a mutual aid support group in your area if needed  It can be hard to get good responses from spinal injury people because every injury is very unique and every person is very unique That said most of the responses below are fantastic I m T10 so not quite the same but it just takes time to figure things out Google her injury level   anything you want to know and you ll find great videos tips and tricks Better yet get her doing this Make sure she understands how important it is to work out the parts she still has control over Every little bit of muscle and every little extra bit of weight counts when it come to mobility transfers all that stuff Lastly life is going to be pretty shit for a while do what you can to listen sympathetically and encourage her if you don t feel like you can help enough with that there is nothing wrong with finding someone who can Sounds like she has a good son Good luck  Everyone here has got the therapy recovery as best as they can so my first advice is to make her diet strict Even if she hates it I m sure she hates the daily activities more   I packed on 70lbs since rehab and it affects everything Transfers showers pain bowel movements getting dressed etc    She s lost so much muscle and SCI makes bowel transit slower You hold on to every calorie you eat I ve dropped 20 30 lbs and life has gotten easier to where I m determined to be as lean as I can be However  I wish I could go back to the start and just not put it on 1500 cal daily is just fine High protein for skin protection and low carbs to avoid insulin resistance   So sorry this happened to your mom It ruins lives and spirits It s gonna be a hard grind to get through the first few years but you guys can do it And there is light at the end of this tunnel All my best and love from California I had kind of a similar challenge but in the opposite direction if that makes sense I m  51M  the dad of a teenage girl with a T9 complete SCI Because of the nature and complexity of her injury she was a long time in ICU CCC inpatient rehab  the better part of 9 months altogether  so we had the advantage   if it can be called that   of all the inpatient services in terms of social and psych as well as the PT OT staff They really helped to set us up for what to expect on transition to home   My OH has some long standing issues with chronic lower back pain so a lot of the physical assistance fell to me when it comes to transfers etc Add the natural shyness and body consciousness of an adolescent girl to the physical weakness and psychological trauma of SCI rehab and that made for some pretty awkward dad daughter conversations  things you really don t ever expect to be doing and conversations you don t ever expect to be having with your adolescent kid are probably pretty much in the same category as things you don t expect to be discussing with your mother   Thankfully in my case my daughter s awesome determination to be self sufficient the gains in her physical upper body strength and her transition through puberty all combined to give both of us a very easy way out of the situation I m very grateful that she didn t go down the  learned dependence  route which would have been easy for her to do and by all accounts would also have been easy for me to facilitate enable without realizing   For your situation I think that last point is probably the key to successful boundary setting Try hard not to build an expectation that you ll do stuff for your mother just because you re there and it s easier Work with your stepdad and whatever outside help you have available to impress upon your mother just how important it is for her to maintain and assert her independence Boundaries are ultimately as important to her as they are to you so make sure you have those conversations early and often   Good luck There s absolutely no escaping that fact that she   and you   face a long and difficult road ahead Try not to be overwhelmed by the size of the task Take the time to look back frequently and celebrate the milestones in rehab  that may help her motivate herself for the next one  find a good injury attorney  your in house care costs are gonna go thru the roof If she is currently in rehab then she likely has a psychologist on her team Your question is a great question and unfortunately one that often doesn t get asked until after it becomes a problem  I wonder if you could reach out to her team psychologist A good one will work with the family as well  I d get in touch with a local SCI charity they may be able to offer you some support to help you deal with what s going on as well as help your mother gain her independence  Long road ahead 5 years here Make sure u research the fuck out of her first wheelchair And u don t have to spend money on expensive adaptive controls for the car I made my own safely and they swap out to any car quickly Message me for any questions Good luck Watch out for pressure ULCERS and power chair lazyness It will kill u quick I think she will be fairly self sufficient when she returns home  Obviously home remodeling is on the checklist  But I think I m worried about the fact that I will become someone that is expected to help and once i m expected and don t deliver then there will be a sense of resentment   There s just a wave of things going through my mind when she gets home I haven t seen her since the start of February due to COVID so I just really don t know what to expect I know she wants me to come spend time initially but I guess I m trying to figure out how to create boundaries in a healthy way   P s I ve heard all about the bowel programs lmaoooI agree that it s difficult to endure as we ve already experienced it firsthand as a family and I can t even begin to imagine how she feels The accommodations are in place for her to be in a safe environment with care It s more of the mental aspect connection of the issue Obviously I care for my mom and I want only the best for her but I guess I m trying to figure out how to create a healthy boundary for the given situation   I am 21 so I haven t been able to have too many difficult conversations like that especially with how traumatic the situation is  This is the best response so far to my question  Thank you so much for your extremely detailed comment and insight into your own personal situation   It truly is something that comes unexpectedly and is completely foreign to a majority of people To say the least I ve been utterly lost with how to approach the situation You ve shed some great insight and advice for how this journey will start go   Again thank you stranger On one of my last posts I was asked how I film and wheel at the same time so here is a video about my wheelchair tripod Hopefully this helps Just got one of these its pretty handy and was  120 ish   https   gettecla com products tecla phone mount  https   gettecla com products tecla phone mount  Wheelchair camera mount  picture looks great   No lapel mic  camera at a distance sounds bleh Camera on the mount is louder but vibration and wind compete with your voice  Thanks for the video I ll have to make one for myself now    Nice Thanks for sharing Thank you I am upgrading to a GoPro with a mic so hopefully that helps with my ongoing audio issues I sustained a spinal cord injury during an LSD trip 4  years ago and am here to share my story and what I ve learned Hi Reddit It s been awhile since I ve posted 4 years ago I sustained a spinal cord injury during an LSD trip My whole life fell apart and now I m living in a nursing home at 34 years old I have learned a lot from all I have been through and wanted to share my story so here s the first part  Ya I feel Like I say that once a day if not more LOL I tell people all the time that breaking my neck and healing from that was the easiest part of this injury the hard part starts when you leave rehab and have to live it day in and day out knowing that there s no end in sight Not gonna lie I am totally jealous that you have use of your hands LOL I found myself just watching your hand in the video seeing how you were able to open and close your fingers even though I know it s partial and it looks like only three fingers but still I feel like if I could get even to that point it would change my life immensely the things we take for granted       I find myself watching people move and walk almost in a voyeuristic way wishing I had it I love living in New England I m about 35 minutes outside the city of Boston in a quiet little suburb town so it s the best of both worlds What part of Florida are you in   deleted  Hey enjoyed listening to your video C4 5 quad here living in Boston area going on 12 years since my accident I dived into a pool and never came up drowned and then resuscitated spent two months on a ventilator six months total in the hospital I can totally relate to everything that you mentioned in the video  and I feel like I go in cycles where I ll be good for a year 18 months and then I start to struggle again and can t find the reason or will to want to go on and that will last for six months or a year and then I end up back on an upswing I don t know that that struggle ever really goes away I m lucky enough to be able to have a family that has been incredibly supportive and able to renovate part of the house to make room for me to live with the changes needed to make it accessible for myself If you d be interested in talking more about quadlife life in general being someone that each of us could reach out to in times of struggle or vice versa let me know I hope you re staying healthy during this craziness and in general    look forward to hearing back from you Just finished the video thank you so much for sharing your story I just want to say I m really proud of you and your strength for overcoming such a big difficulty in your life   I was 16 when I got injured am 18 now L3 L5 incomplete can walk but there s still severe nerve damage so there s a limp Had 3 surgeries on my back and pelvis totally up to 24 hours of surgeries In other words a shitty accident lol Sometimes I hate the way I am because I can t do the same things as my peers Like drinking alcohol or wearing heels or going to a party But at the same time I m grateful that I m alive and is probably stronger than 90  of the people I m surrounded with   I 100  agree with you in terms of having that inner strength I think the one thing that saved me was my mindset I find the fact that you re sharing your story to be extremely courageous I still have trouble telling it as I m afraid of how people will look at me Thanks for sharing you ve inspired me    May God bless you  Hi thank you for sharing your story I really would like to connect and have a chat I love those deep conversations Monday it s my 19 anniversary I m 38 and I was 19 when out of the blue I became quad I ended up writing a book to share what I ve been through in the hope of helping others going through similar situations Sharing is caring    This is my book https   www amazon com my chair yours Juliana Carvalho ebook dp B083XMNJBZ  Please let me know If you are keen to chat I m from Brazil and live in NZ But I ve been fighting immigration here for 7 years trying to get the residency I m facing deportation and my appeal is with the minister of immigration my last avenue Just sitting here amid the pandemic waiting for my fate And trusting the universe knows what is best  Thank you for posting  I m a friend of a quad this video was great perspective for me He has bouts of not wanting to talk to anyone but I love him and I try to remind myself of what he s going through  Definitely I could totally accept life in the chair give me back those hands usually in my darkest moments is when I m most aware that I could be in a much worse situation whether it be zero movement or stuck on a vent or like you said the terror that must be locked in syndrome And it s crazy that unfortunately it takes losing the gift of a working body for us to appreciate The absolute amazing feat of nature that it really is Everything about it taken separately it s amazing what do you think all the systems and parts work together fluidly the way it does is astounding LOL I too appreciate the clitoris I try to make it known   Have you had any significant health setbacks in your four years  hey i ve thought about you every couple of months for the past couple of years we talked a bit back when you were condisdering euthanesia   I had different account back then Happy you are doing better God bless you  Thanks for sharing  As someone who has also experienced both an SCI and LSD trips I cant imagine what that woukd have felt like in the moment Talk about confusion and fear  wow  I also have gained a much more nuanced idea belief about what you might call God compared to my formally traditionally informed Judeo Christian idea of what that is ir might be  Anyway  Alot to relate to thanks again for sharing  Thanks for sharing T9 coming up on 6 years now my own accident was caused by a bad mushroom trip  Well I m glad I didn t start doing LSD until after my injury  HAHA How you ve survived is a mystery to me I ve always believed that if there is a God they put me in a serious timeout  Thanks for posting this  I m HITTING u back with a response vid 20 mins biznitch I enjoyed hearing your story thanks for postingYeah I often say that the not being able to walk part is the least of my problems I get being envious of my hands if yours aren t as dexterous I was thinking how strange it is that my life has led me to a place where I am jealous of paraplegics At the same time I m very grateful for what I do have and there isn t a day that goes by that I don t think of those with worse injuries than mine especially those with locked in syndrome how insane  People s working bodies seem like incredible feats of art and engineering to me now My own body does too I guess but WORKING BODIES I mean wow Standing upright  Supporting that heavy head  TEN fingers   A CLITORIS ARE YOU KIDDING ME Thanks for your support then and now  Yeah that movie came out right after I was injured and it was super awkward to watch because my life was all bladder and bowel issues and struggling to get through the day NOT a romance But yeah I was applying for assisted suicide at the same place as the character in that movie Thanks so much for listening I hear you with the ups and downs Sometimes I m just like WHY IS THIS SO HARD then I remember people normally can move and control their bodies It s a very tough hand to be dealt I have immense love for you having suffered the same fate Man I love Boston too It s the last place I had traveled before the trip to India that broke my neck Thanks so much for listening and I m sending you lots of love Your voice and story are wanted I once read that God wrote our stories so it s silly not to share them It s not easy putting yourself out there but it s worth it Best of luck Hi howd u get injured Good on you for writing a book wow I hope your living situation problems get lost  Sharing is caring indeed    I m up for a chat dm me I can tell you that for a time after my injury the only relationship dynamic I wanted was to know the darkest and most intimate parts of my friends lives Yeah it s a misery loves company thing maybe but mostly it was just that I felt soooooo exposed that I yearned to know someone else s secrets I felt like all my dirty laundry was spilled all over and it only made me feel alive to connect with someone on a very deep level I still don t have much capacity for small talk How did you use your stimulus package Here are some items i ordered including a show bench and a freewheel Im so happy right now The fact that you even have to pay for this shit out of pocket is insane to me I get everything I need for  free  taxes  here in Sweden  Where do you live you shouldn t have to buy a chair for sure   in fact all that should be covered by insurance even in this 3rd world country called the USA lol except maybe the wheel  Private insurance in the US often wont cover any bathroom equipment at all  Hey I use that shower bench I love mine  Wow your post was depressing It made me realize I have been in a wheelchair so long that the price of freewheels has doubled since I bought mine  Didn t get one  I have yet to get any stimulas money America is literally the worst if you can t tell I pay 1100 a month for insurance and catheters This is for  freewheel  attachment not a wheelchair Insurance does not pay for that   I really needed to replace my shower bench asap so i couldn t wait for an organisation to help me   Trust me i have family in central America and Mexico lol u s is not a third world country Never is and never will be thats a fact    Btw i live in CaliforniaMedicare Medicaid used to pay for padded shower chairs for me  not anymore  Past five years or so I ve had to pay out of pocket  I think they ll only pay for the cheap hard plastic ones which my skin can t handle I know had some tacos a few nights ago im glad i have that cut out if you know what i mean Yeah my post was meant to stir up all types of feelings but im personally happy I think its still worth it for me im turning 40 and been T11 since 1998 I live in a urban area never had enough money to buy any but my cannabis Lol Sorry bro why not     are you in the U S How Quarantined Are Y all Staying Compromised lungs  so while I keep my distance I have gone to social gatherings where everyone does  Creative Ways to Find Medical Supplies During the COVID 19 OutbreakRecommendations for vehiclesWhat s your situation I will personally be looking into getting the Subaru Crosstrek because it s built like a tank Used to ride motorcycles but now I am a member of this sub hahaha  C6 level  I have a van with a ramp and swivel driver seat I wanted to save wear and tear on my shoulders by not having to break down the wheelchair getting in and out of the car  T5 I transfer into a drivers seat to drive with hand controls I have a Mazda 5 with van style sliding doors It works pretty well for me  T9 I drive a normal minivan with hand controls from Amazon The best thing about it is I can throw my chair in complete not needing to break it down each time I get in or out It was also 1 4 the price of anything with a ramp   The biggest downside is it takes a pretty aggressive transfer with the height of the driver s seat  I worry about the wear it causes on my shoulder long term As a young guy with no kids it was also an ego blow to be driving at first  I m a T4 paraplegic I drive a Honda Element They have suicide doors for the back seat I take the wheels and cushion off my chair fold the back rest down and toss everything in the seat behind me I previously had a Saturn Ion with suicide doors which sits a lot lower The height was an issue when I first got the Element because I was used to resting my feet on the ground for balance as I disassembled my chair I bought a  15 folding step stool so that I can still rest my feet on something and now it s super simple to transfer in and out Works like a charm Love the vehicle    https   imgur com a fEnUDP0 Nissan Maxima  I love that it has two seat setting buttons I ve got it set up so when I get out of the car I push one for the seat to go all the way back And push the second one once I m ready to drive It s handy I use Veigel  sp   hand controls and they are wonderful  It s a fun car to drive as it has some good zip and it s a sleek looking car   The biggest issues I have is that I ve already got shoulder issues brewing so sometimes breaking my chair down and throwing it in the passenger seat is a little difficult Secondly due to my chair either riding shotgun or in the backseat taking multiple passengers is frustating Also hauling a wheelchair in and out of a vehicle destroys the interior Exterior too Lots of rips dings and scratches all over my car from the chair  L1 incomplete  I am commenting to follow  Looking at something fairly large with lumbar support  Been looking at the XT5 but not decided  T7 I have a toyota Corolla I transfer in then I can dismantle the chair and get it in the car with me easily enough    I like the car Very cheap to maintain Nice height to get in and out of    Bear in mind any car that has a wheelchair near it is going to end up a bit battered    Mini Cooper It has big doors the car is easy to transfer into and it has enough room to put your chair in the passenger seat Plus it s fun to drive Monarch hand controls fit well and are about 900 bucks   My second favorite is a Lincoln towncar I bought a used one from a limo company It s easy to get into and tons of room C6 Audi TT It s perfect for us  I was a big hiking back packer For me a Jeep Wrangler helped me find a part of my life I was missing While not as convenient as the vans it definitely helped my mental health tremendously  t8 and drive a freedom motor rear entry Toyota Sienna No complaints  t 10 incomplete and i drive a nissan sentra i like the height because it s pretty even with my chair and i have plenty of room to throw everything inside once i break my chair down  I m T 1   drive a Honda Accord one of the few 2 door vehicles left I also have a Van because my wife   I are both Para s so we use the van when going out together The car love the quick pick up   speed but hate the trouble of putting the chair in The Van is lousy for city driving   kind of tight for 2 wheelchairs lousy mileage T12 incomplete here I have 2 cars one is a bmw e90   the other is an e46   I can easily put the wheels arms cushion in back seat   chair in passenger seat When with a friend they can just put the chair in the trunk so there s still room for passengers Plus you can do sick skids   I m not talking about in your pants My personal opinion suvs trucks all cars that are higher are way harder to get in and get the wheelchair in I would stick with a low to the ground car  Extra cab Dakota  the doors open wider I use a platform lift to get in and had it lowered 3   T4 complete Toyota Tacoma TRD I have a crane are that lowers my chair in the bed No lift manual transfer It s not a transfer for the feint of heart but I m in fairly good shape and 6 5  I have never owned a truck and always wanted one It s a little impractical but it keeps me on my toes about transfers and staying in shape  I m T11 and drive a Mazda5 If you don t mind driving essentially a mini mini van I highly recommend The practicality made it a no brained for me I bought a second one last year I take the bucket seat out behind the driver s seat and can get in out without taking my chair apart which saves me a lot of time I pull my chair in backwards behind me and use a piece of wood to pull the sliding door shut Good luck I m T10 complete and I drive a crosstrek highly recommend from my sideT2 t3 incomplete  I m having my Harley modified Not asking for me but for a friend who s about to start driving again

Will reach out to you soon   Gave the freewheel attachment a try in today s YouTube video Anyone else use one Didn t work in grass as I hoped but maybe that s my fault I love the free wheel It s great for rough terrain bumpy cracked sidewalks and long pushes in general It actually helps with grass a lot with me but it seems I have a bit more triceps than you so that could make a difference I also feel like my casters lift a bit higher than yours maybe it s a size difference in casters Also if you have a TiLite you have to bolt your foot plate down first  I got one when I first got out of rehab but I ve only used it a few times  I have a Mountain Trike and a Firefly that keep me pretty well covered  The freewheel just didn t do what I wanted it to  Great video man  You should do a video or at least show us a picture of your camera setup on your chair there    I want to start getting into video work and that looks like a great idea  Try an E fix for offroad  The turning on it is rubbish and if going downhill and turn suddenly barrel roll  Which it always wants to do and need a lot of strength to put it back straight even with changed turning resistance Amazed this hasn t been improved yet if you re on a grass hill and try to turn from sitting still will get forearm injury or be stuck It is alright for off road but the recline gives pressure marks on lower spine when going over bumps Better than nothing I guess but could be re imagined  I love my freewheel According to Strava I hit 25mph coming down one of the carriage trails in the Moses Cone estate  D I have 4 inch casters I m gonna try and adjust the freewheel so it lifts my casters higher I think that ll help with the grass It worked great everywhere else but the thick grass Those mountain trikes look sick You want to sell yours Thanks Really appreciate it I ll work on getting a video up this week Blurry visionAre you on any new medication A lot of antimuscarinic and anticholinergic medications  both related to spasms  cause blurred vision I believe that to be the case for certain antibiotics as well though it s been a while since I ve been on anything super heavy duty intravenously and cannot confirm from personal experience  Was your vision normal before surgery Did you wake up immediately after surgery with blurry vision How long ago was your surgery Has it gotten better worse stayed the same   In short not sure Glasses can help if the problem with the eyes is not with the optic nerve You seem to suggest from your post that you woke up with decreased vision after your surgery which would imply some sort of perioperative event ischemic perhaps that affected your vision   Also possible it s something like a corneal abrasion which can happen if you re on your stomach and your eyes aren t protected well Those heal pretty quickly though   Again not sure because only an ophthalmologist can tell you for sure what the cause of blurry vision is I d go see one if you re worried They can look at different parts of your eye and diagnose problems and tell you what s going on  I am not on any new new meds The blurred visioned has happened a few weeks after surgery  I mean I was on antibiotics a few times for UTI But like I said the blurred double vision has happened a few weeks after surgery Any thing else I can do I need to be able to seeI ve had blurred vision randomly and I take meds for spasms so this was interesting to know I thought my eyesight was going all of a suddenYes I went and saw an ophthalmologist and waiting for my prescription glasses About a few weeks after surgery I started noticing a difference My vision was not even near as bad as it is now  it s bad now and I m worried it s due to spinal cord Injury from surgery I cannot say docs name I do f think due to legal reasons  Glasses can help if the problem with the eyes is not with the optic nerve   Vision issues can also arise if the nerves controlling the muscles responsible for eye movement and pupil dilation are affected How am I supposed to afford anything How do you Get in touch with an OT and or a social worker Funding will heavily depend on where you live  After my injury I was able to enroll in a state vocational rehab program which paid for my driving courses and hand controls I know they are able to pay for more significant vehicle modifications like van conversions in order to help people return to work   Since you have been working part time I m not sure this will be at all helpful But there may be other state programs which can help subsidized the cost I would probably call a local company that preforms conversions and see what grants state programs they ve worked with in the past  Depending on what state you live in there may be several grant programs that you could sign up for  Agree with the other posters Look into what your state vocational rehab can help with It s not easy and you have to fight for what you need but there are programs that offer help  Same I went back to the retail job I had before my injury which pays decent but I spend so much money on meds and supplies im broke as fuck Vocational is going to pay for me to fill back to school but I m about to lose my SSI so I m not sure how im going to get everything paid for  Same here I live in KY and OT paid for all the conversions ramp hand controls etc I had to still buy the van but luckily I had my brother cosign for me to make things easier Did anyone else catch Elon musk on Joe Rogan s podcast  1470 I ll have to give this a listen thanks for sharing  I haven t had a chance to

is gonna do I found it interesting But I don t know how it could apply to spinal cord injury He mentioned how it has the potential to help fix people who have had strokes or Parkinson s and other neurological things like that But with spinal cord injury the problem isn t in the brain The problem is that the brain can t communicate with the body So I don t see how adding some kind of fixing computer chip to the brain would help when the message still can t get past the injured part of our spinal cord I ve got a titanium rod in my right shin So I m already 25  of the way to having metal

quattro Where is it If it s on the coccyx a ride cushion can totally offload that Otherwise roho probably is your best bet If you have a wound vac you should be able to get insurance to pay for a

his accident and 7 years of dealing with wounds We have finally found a great routine that works and have just about gotten them all but healed up He s had 2 flap surgeries over the years Good luck         this is what I would go with I say that as a RN and someone with an SCI Yeah right on the coccyx That is a great idea I haven t thought of the insurance thing I m definitely going to hit my max out of pocket so might as well get all I can out of that Honestly I should see if I can work out a new wheelchair cause mine is beat and it will be 5 years past my accident in January Thank you for

to the point where my one hip won t even touch when I am laying on my stomach It gets really twisted I know some people with SCI are skeptical of seeing one but I don t allow mine to crack anything

you so much Thank you College with an SCI My uncle used his accident 3 years ago as an opportunity to go back to community college and finish his degree The accessibility offices at the CC we both attend has free services so that he was able to have somebody take notes for him in class and all of the material and testing was accessible to him Don t let it stop you Community college is a great option to for people who did not do so great in high school and may even do better in college than they did in HS I think community college makes sense if you can transfer credits you also save money Get a few classes out of the way work out any issues and transfer after the first year or semester You need to check with colleges in advance about accepting credit transfers There s usually space available after people drop out but you miss out on some of the freshman socializing It gives you a chance to ease into college level work without stress of getting your basic sci stuff setup taken care of in a dorm room It can really depend on which college because you want to go somewhere where you have the right accomodations and accessibility   I went straight to college after graduating but took almost two year off during high school after my sci My grades were very good I still had issues with personal living issues in the dorm and it didn t help academically and there was a grade drop Some colleges have no experience with accomodations related to sci because most students are there with something like ADHD You definitely want to check them out first  Definitely don t overlook community college or state public colleges as a starting point for your university career I had a great GPA in high school  way before I had my spinal cord injury   my GPA would have taken a nose dive in that situation too   and when to a state school because my dad was a professor there and I got free tuition  No he didn t teach any of my classes and he had transferred to one of the regional campuses so we never saw each other at college   I kind of resented it at first because I wanted to go to a  good school  but I actually had an amazing experience I was in the Honors College so we had smaller class sizes so that s something to keep in mind if you re open to state schools You could always start off at community college or a regional campus and transfer into the honors program at the main campus if you have a similar system where you live And state schools often have more resources for disabled students   my nephew now goes to that same university and has had great support from disability services   I also took my last two years of high school at one of the regional campuses and again they had smaller classrooms and better teaching Staff at bigger and most prestigious universities are often hired based on their research not their teaching so with community colleges and regional campuses you tend to get more staff who just love teaching and have more time to focus on it   Whatever you choose good luck  So I have just a tad bit of expirence with poor HS GPA and college All of that stuff you see on internet what your counselors say  and probably classmates say is a lot of hearsay and kinda misleading You can totally get in with a poor GPA mostly because I ve done it Just once you apply it will probably flag you application and say you will need to write an essay explaining your situation how you ve changed and how what happened in HS won t happen again All you have to do is answer the questions BUT and this is important you should have an open line of communication with admissions and the office of disability services explaining the situation Your more likely gonna get an acceptance notification that way   Now that being said if school is just hard for you then CC is a great way to get your feet wet save money and get back into the rythem of things A real college is so much harder than most people realize and honestly most of them are not accessible or accommodating Its a sink or swim atmosphere at those places and if your not ready for that then don t do it Having a bad college GPA is waaay worse than having a bad HS GPA   If you want to go to a full university TOUR THE CAMPUS Every schools says they re ada and accessible but thats because the pretty much have to be Example  The University of Cincinnati They are  technically  accessible but in order to go across campus you gotta go through like 2 buildings up 2 elevators and up a hill  imagine if there is snow or rain or God forbid an emergency you are totally screwed If they have to close a certain entrance again screwed   That being said it really depends on how much you want to put yourself through I agree CC sucks if you want the college experience then don t go to a community College But they are typically more accessible If you want to go to a university coordinate with the office of disability services this is their job they will accommodate   I hope this helps pm me if have questions   Source  lots of personal experience  I was injured after my freshman year of college and after taking a few years off I went back to community college Like another comment said disability services will be extremely helpful in making sure that all of your needed classroom accommodations are available to you I also had pretty bad grades my first year of college but after getting myself together post injury they improved markedly I graduated with an associates degree two years ago and will receive a bachelors degree in December   Disability services offices can vary widely as well I am at a large university that has a reputation for being very disability friendly and this has been a significant improvement over the services offered at my very small community college That being said my experience at the community college worked wonders for both raising my GPA and helping me adjust to college with an sci I wouldn t have gotten into the university I m at now without those years of CC Hey I was injured in high school as well I did two years at Community college then transferred to a bigger school out of my hometown  Best thing I ever    If you re in the US check with your Vocational Services They are extremely helpful They can help you with cost and getting personal care and accommodations   PM   I got a degree in engineering btw My GPA in highschool was ok I ve always been fairly smart but I m lazy as fuck and never learned to study so I really coasted I got into college and fucked it hard by partying away money I declared academic bankruptcy  basically wipes everything  and then proceeded to fuck it up again Now im 30 almost 2 years past my injury and the state is going to pay for me to go back If I can get in again so can you   Find your vocational rehab person  usually done by zip code by the state  They can help you get in and get it covered Also take time to visit the administration office of the college you want to go to  probably do that before vocab  and explain the situation There are strings they can pull to help you  Hey Had a severe skiing accident two years ago Injured L3 L5   a burst fractured pelvis Was in 3 surgeries that accumulated to  24 hours Happened when I was 16 and I just finished my first year at university I m in Canada so I m not sure if that makes a difference   My university is pretty accommodating but I still have to do physio weekly I really recommend emailing potential universities colleges to see how they can help with your experience Also there is not shame in taking less courses Quality over quantity   Chronic pain sucks but I somehow managed It will only get better here from now on Don t lose hope no matter what Just be grateful that you are alive and you have so much potential in you I believe in you   deleted  Attending a CC and then transferring out is actually a smart plan You save money on tuition and get your pre requisite classes knocked out at a discount No one is going to care that you went to a CC after graduating from a 4 year school I don t see how it makes things more complicated You can still experience college life at a 4 year school I joined my fraternity when I was a junior As far as your parents go they don t seem to have your best interests at heart or you don t portray them that way no offense If they wouldn t allow you to live with them while attending a CC or because you attended a CC for two years then they re not the most caring or the most sensible  Hello Have you heard of The Ramp Less Travelled It s a non profit designed for folks with SCI trying to navigate college admissions They even offer scholarships   Here s the link  http   ramplesstraveled org our solution  Saw the comments about your parents caring about school prestige  would they be okay with you going to a worse non CC though just cuz it wasn t a CC Because there are definitely worse options than CC and at least community would give you the potential of transferring into a more prestigious school   Put another way if you can t get into a good school what are your options  it s always good to have a backup plan   As for the whole college experience thing if you mean living and experiencing dorm life some schools still give you the option to live in the dorms even in your junior and senior years  esp if you have SCI  so I wouldn t rule that out either   Now all that said what in particular about the process are you asking about Application Vetting schools I ve been out for a while now but I don t feel like my experience was too different from non SCI folks aside from logistical stuff  more limited dorm options but guaranteed options etc etc   What kind of mentality is  I can only do community college   That s a pretty big slap in the face to anyone who attends community college like it s somehow beneath you or people who actually care about education  How about taking community college as an opportunity to better yourself and get a degree   Are you Asian by chance this mentality is huge among Asian families   I m disabled and fucked around in HS cause HS is mostly just BS anyways and had a 1 6GPA by the time I finished  Ended up in community college where I   gasp   saved money and took exactly the same classes as anyone else in a university  I then went on to transfer to a university and graduate  I also then went on to get my MA  So don t give me any pathetic line about community college as somehow an afront to your moral code  Thanks for the comment I had really good test scores in high school and I don t really want to go to community college for personal reasons but I appreciate the perspective Thank you for the response I ve definitely considered going to a state school I m just not quite on board with a CC for personal reasons  I ve always really wanted to get the  college experience  although I suppose now that things have changed a good bit that might be a silly reason School was hard for me sophomore and junior year because I was in and out of the hospital senior year once I had adjusted to being in a chair I was fine and my GPA went back up  Weighted senior year it was a 4 2  Would you mind if I DMd you with some questions Thank you so much for the response My main goal is just getting into collegeI know there s nothing wrong with Community College it d just make things a lot more complicated Just because my parents aren t the most sensible doesn t really mean I can just do it anyways right now I still kind of need their support for certain things Never heard of them sounds like a great resource Thank you so much My main concern right now is just applying with a low GPA I have good test scores and everything else the only problem is really the low GPA I m just not really sure if colleges will take into account the fact it s not really my fault or if its gonna be instant rejection anyways Also I m slightly worried about campus accessibility especially because I m not gonna be able to visit too many campuses that aren t within a reasonable drive I use a power chair and stairs are scary Hills can also be scary haha I m not Asian but my parents won t let me stay at home if I do community college There s really no need to be hostile it s not solely my choice I never said it was inferior it s just not what I personally want to do Need a little helpThere s different degrees of autonomic dysreflexia which I m willing to bet is what you re experiencing on the low range   Call your doctor and ask if a prescription of captopril is appropriate   For the mid to high range acute AD having a tube of nitroglycerin paste near your bedside might save your life someday No one wants to go out via hemorrhagic stroke   If you re really against written scrips some otc lidocaine spray on the burn might temporarily keep the pain signals from getting to your spinal cord  Assuming you re in the US there are no approved OTC drugs for high blood pressure Your best bet is to phone your GP and let them know what s happening and also avoid salt and caffeine eat potassium  or take a potassium and maybe a magnesium supplement  and increase your dietary fibre  thanks for the info i finally got into see my doctor but he has no idea what AD is and seemed really stand off and dismissive about everything so he just referred me to a neurologist my BP has stabilized in retrospect it probably wasn t a good idea to wait and see like i did but oh well is the captopril more of a take as needed or long term med Gabapentin  love or hate It s worthless They put everyone with SCI on it I quit taking it and lost 20 pounds and had no change in my pain level s Do you get a lot of nerve pain 3600 mg day seems like a lot I take 1500 mg day I used to take 2400 mg day Funny thing is when I lowered the dosage I didn t really notice a difference  I m on 2700mg a day and I don t have any side affects like drowsiness or what not Or at least I don t feel them It helps with my nerve pain I get and I have an extra PRN that I can take if I have a nerve pain flare up Hopefully I ll get off work it or a lower dose because I m tired of swallowing yellow pills 3 times every time at lunch brekky and bed    Was on it for  4 months and made 90  of my pain go away But it was a lot of work to stop using it   Took me about  2 months to stop using it cuz I had to reduce dosage at a small amount at a time Caused sleepless nights cuz my nerves body was so used to being numb from the pain   I m glad I m off of it completely because I don t get drowsy as much and my attention span has significantly increased  I just started taking it about a month ago Havent had any side effects yet but I m only on 900mg a day Hasn t really helped the nerve pain I think the dose might need increased  I was taking 3600 mg every day for three years and one time when I was filling my weekly meds I forgot to include it I was in the ER for three days with hysterical episodes of AD and I was straight up withdrawing from the medication After that I decided I was going to wean off of it which took about three months and now I ve been off of it for about a year The main thing that being off it helps with is regulating my temperature Because my nerve pain is a burning sensation I am less cold than I used to be because my nerve pain is a little bit more consistent now My nerve pain is still pretty bad but I can use PRN drugs like amitriptyline when it gets really bad  Hate 37 years old injured when I was 20  C5 C6   Been on 3000 mg a day the entire time Not even sure it does anything at this point other than a placebo affect I suppose  Why do you say worthless Yeah had been on 1200 when I first started therapy about 2 months after my accident That eventually went to 1600 then 2400 and now I m at 3600 I started experiencing severe muscle spasms tightness and pain this January thus the increase to 2400mg When that didn t seem to help I was recommended to a pain specialist to be evaluated for CRPS Well Covid put a damper on that plan After a teleconference he did decide to increase it to 3600mg That ultimately wasn t the exact solution as the pain spasms and muscle tightness are all present just less severe Now I find myself passing out almost like clockwork every hour after receiving my dosage Any of my fellow quads got tips on how to crack an egg  I tried and it was HARD I love your bingo card and problem solving in this video You should consider cross posting to r OccupationalTherapy I was intrigued about methods for cracking an egg and found a video of a woman who seems to have a similar level of function sharing her technique  https   m youtube com watch v GxPlHZInblA I hope it is helpful  I use my mouth  D Thanks very much That is helpful I ll think about crossposting over there Do you really  I debated trying that I have a friend who is struggling to find pain management that he is happy with I don t believe Oxy helps at all with nerve burning sensations  But it can cause stomache pains and bowel problems Has he tried quitting them and see if there any difference  RSO or Rick Simpson Oil will help with everything from the pain to the spasms and it s a natural extract  Like to be the same Question about incomplete T4 sciHi T2 incomplete here with a similar surgery I went into the surgery able to move my legs and came out with nothing for a while I found inpatient rehab to be super helpful though Right now I still don t have any useful function but I ve regained a lot of sensation in my lower body and can fire certain muscle groups I m 11 months post accident Feel free to ask me if you have any other questions And also each situation is better different depending on the severity of her injury it s possible she could be walking by the time she s done with rehab I do really suggest inpatient rehab though if she can it s super useful and gets a lot more progress done and has more access to care during the initial recovery stages  Hello I suffered a spinal cord injury almost six years ago I fractured the C6 vertebrae and am a C7 quadriplegic I am incomplete meaning I didn t completely sever my spinal cord As far as the ability to walk again the first year will give you an idea That s the time span you ll see any improvement in mobility of the lower extremities The only thing I regained was the movement of some of my toes but everyone is different   I was in inpatient rehab for two months I personally don t picture going straight home to do pt but that s just my experience The idea of having to do it ducks yes but looking back I wouldn t do it differently I improved a lot and had some great friendships made from it You learn a lot   This injury is very scary in the beginning I do want to tell you though regardless of what happens it does get better I ve talked with numerous others that have been early in their injury and they feel like life is over Far from it I m independent as a quadriplegic I have a vehicle I can drive and go out and still do all kinds of fun things Mindset is important during this time Being there for her and keeping her positive will go miles   If you have any other questions I ll be happy to answer Also if you look on the pinned post you ll see a link to the discord group There s a lot of active people in it that will be happy to help answer questions too They talk about things related to the injury or just regular things like what shows are really good at the moment It s a really good community  It depends   each injury even with the same mechanism in the same pattern and level has different outcomes Some loss of mobility sensation and function   below the injury level   bowel bladder etc  is likely to happen and can be permanent An incomplete injury means there s more potential for recovery but it is rarely complete recovery Active rehab is key She will find out more as her primary injury heals and she is tested in rehab and gets more into physio therapy and OT what her rehab overhaul could look like   Best of luck it s a tough time   just give her the space to work on her recovery with no expectations   be her cheering squad not her drill sargeant It s common for people who get some recovery to feel guilty or like they are expected to be  back to normal  after rehab when they still have lasting permanent issues like pain or spasticity or bladder dysfunction  so try to be that person who just wants to support her recovery no matter what it looks like   I wish you guys the best  Anything is possible with an incomplete injury I m a T12 L1 incomplete for over 3 years now and I can only walk about 300 feet with braces and a walker with help There are other people with higher injuries that can walk alright It all depends on the extent of the damage done to her spinal cord Inpatient rehab helped me tremendously but I was in really bad shape and stayed in inpatient for 4 months I still do outpatient PT twice a week and that is really necessary for recovering I truly hope for a good outcome for your sister  T11 incomplete everyone is different and everybody reacts different to therapy and speed How long she s In therapy depends on insurance her needs and doctors evaluation on progress PT and OT will work on your goals I Highly recommend that she s stay inpatient and don t rush home for therapy I did that and regretted it every second as it took way more to get into another therapy and I m not getting good therapy at that  As for her walking again only time well tell You will see this a lot around here but not to injury are the same even with same lv They won t prob release her from hospital until she has bladder and bowl management basic wheelchair skills and transfers down and she ll prob be in a turtle till therapy and her back heals enough to be self supporting w o a brace One thing she needs to focus on is mental health post injury and well as ot pt Hi just out of curiosity what country are you in I m 11 months post injury C6 7 incomplete and I spent just over 6 months in in patient rehab which is normal here in Australia and it was the best thing for me with out question   Now I can appreciate that if you live in a country where your hospital stay is going to cost you the limiting that stay might seem like the best option I would recommend trying to get as much in patient physio as is practical cost effective for your sisters   I know go to out penitent physio 3 times a week for 1h each and try and do 1 2h on my off days at home   Every ones out comes are different and its a long hard road Your sister is going to need your love and support even if sometime s that means giving her some space  I can tell you what her out come will be but I can share my results to date   I was told I might be able to walk between 5 100m  16 328f  I m currently up to 1 5km  0 9 mile  with crutches It ant fast or prittey but it alot more than was expected  I m a t2 t3 incomplete Suffered 1 year ago today They say I will never walk again Its not so bad my arms work I have a good support system also SSDI isn t bad for me and I have good insurance Any questions feel free to DM me  C3 c4 here Like the previous person said it s different for everyone I can walk but its extremely slow and with a limp Also did OP say if it was complete or incomplete Bored in rehab I got hurt back in 2006 so we didn t have issues with corona and restrictions on visitors but most everyone I knew besides my immediate family bailed on me so I never really had any visitors haha if I was you I d get on your hospitals WiFi and get a list of Netflix shows you wanna watch and kill some time that way I watched a lot of movies during my downtime in rehab and it was helpful  Where are you at My 17yo nephew is in rehab now only 1 parent visiting also I can hardly wait to visit him He just asked me for movie   TV show recommendations   Try reaching out to other patients   families there  Maybe learn a new subject Khan Academy YouTube MITx and Harvard University have free online classes  they are   challenging    There s a bunch of places offering  free for Covid  classes I m doing some coding classes now That kind of thing would probably  maybe   be difficult depending on your dexterity   What kind of interests do you have what are your passions Seek them out  Do you have a Nintendo Switch You could put 100 hours or more into breath of the wild and or witcher 3 Honestly I watched movies    Mystery Science Theater 3000  https   en wikipedia org wiki Mystery_Science_Theater_3000  was super helpful to me it just felt like company and there s loads of it so that was pretty helpful It also might a good time to learn about a topic you re interested in when I didn t have a lot of function I found a bunch of factual audiobooks and listened through them and when I got enough function to type I had a bunch of topics to read about engage with online  A lot of good suggestions so far I would also like to add talking with your therapists about grabbing you for additional therapy if they have time Sometimes schedules get changed last minute or patients refuse therapy and if that s the case if they know you re down for some extra time they can come get you This is especially helpful on the weekends when the downtime is the most boring You can also ask if there s some exercises to do in your room and the therapy teams can give you some small equipment to use in the room I would also ask if there s any recreational therapy available sometimes they have some crafts or other fun things to do  I was at craig for three months and I found playing Pok mon go helped pass the time As I wheeled around and did lots of laps Lots of mobile games reading and movies will help but don t use it to cope   drown yourself out  I brought my Nintendo switch with me earlier this year in January to inpatient rehab Kept me pretty busy with BOTW and now animal crossing is out Are you allowed to go around to other patient rooms on the same floor Someone else on my floor had brought his Nintendo switch and we ended up having mini smash bro s sessions with a couple one of the RN s and PT s that also played Though I m lucky SCVMC had a lotta staff and patients around my age  mid to late 20 s  Coursera Alison and open learn have free courses as well

15 minute walk away from my house I ride my hand cycle past it a few times a week 13 years for me and I was a week away from visiting my site overseas when we had to shelter in place Looking forward to doing it in the near future and meeting the guy that saved my life I m imagining a very surreal experience Will definitely check out your vid  Must be a sucky feeling to have such misplaced anger at something you don t believe exists I thank God we live in a world where I can place credit to anything I want If I want to place credit for me being alive to a zucchini what is it to you You re entitled to your beliefs and I m entitled to mine The rad thing about life and maturity is when you realize we don t all have to believe in the same thing and can still support each other I praise God for the drs and nurses and therapists who helped me get where I am and the medical school universities I lecture at never have a problem with me praising God so I don t know why you take such offense to some random dude online rambling Have a good day Every time I go past mine I like to yell at it haha find it therapeutic hahahaIf you don t mind me asking where did you get hurt For those who are incomplete or complete what did it feel like to regain sensation and muscle control I went from zero sensation in my arms and hands and almost no motor control  shoulders through hands  to almost 100  recovery over the course of about a year and a half I don t think I ever felt anything specific as function came back As sensation returned I would go through various phases of dysesthesia such as pins and needles a buzzing sensation pain and persistent itching These didn t seem to follow any kind of specific order and would come and go   I had to rely on objective measurements to be able to tell how much I had improved Number of rungs on a finger ladder number of reps of various strengthening exercises which theraband color I could use how much free weight I could use time to complete various fine motor tasks number of pushups pullups etc at a time and so on    how the nerves are damaged when a blood vessel leaks  Blood vessels supply the tissue with oxygen and nutrients and remove metabolic end products If a blood vessel leaks or ruptures the blood supply of the tissue is compromised and the cells get damaged or die due to lack of oxygen  nerve cells especially do not tolerate lack of oxygen well   I never got full sensation back   but I do have the buzzing sensation and the fun chronic pain I didn t feel anything super specific just noticed one day that instead of nothing I was getting low level buzzing feelings and obviously I noticed the pain but when the pain isn t there its just this kind of buzzing I regained a lowered tempertaure sensing in my hands and lower arms and use them to assess the bits that are most likely to get cold   but even that I just kind of noticed one day   I went from pretty zero motor control from the lower jaw neck down to regaining use of a lot of my arms and shoulders and some trunk All the measuring was done against other things like I couldn t raise my arm off the bed or move my shoulder or whatever so I worked to do that and would get like tiny bits of progress that all incrementally built up to more complex movements My right hand for example is a goddamn miracle and I can move the first 2 fingers almost 100  and that was through trying to move tiny groups of muscles Improvement was basically how well I could do the thing or how long I could hold a certain position how fast or how many  Thank you that helps me visualize it a lot better Any Para Quad Walkers use or used Step Smart BraceI m not handicapped but my late father was a polio survivor One of his ankles was surgically partially fused to prevent a complete drop foot  I don t know what braces he may have used in his youth and I didn t really pay attention to his handicap till he was in his 50 s or so  Around that time I know that he experimented with an elastic bandage that he wrapped around his foot and ankle    in a figure  8  IIRC    that apparently reduced the foot drop further   Obviously I can t advocate any such remedy but I though you might want to know about it  Bike riding  Hey mine is c6 7 incomplete from a bike accident too I have no desire to ride again but that is awesome that you do I think it is totally possible for you and

https   www facebook com groups 1575256319434654  ref share  They might have some SCI specific resources for you to reach out to Do you have any churches near you Even if you re not a member they can probably get you in touch with people who can help bring groceries and do other things I live with the family that caregivers for me It s a household of 6 adults  3 adult children have lost their jobs  So only one person goes out to shop quickly and he showers as soon as he comes home Otherwise DELIVERY whenever possible Meds from pharmacy Delivery Need something from the store but don t want to make an extra risky trip Delivery Eating out Delivery We ve used these services plus hand washing and wiping down packages etc I don t see any way that caregivers outside of the home can go about their lives without EVER coming into contact with others Perhaps if you set a rule such as  You must be not be in a group of 10 or more people  as part of the employment requirement Just trying to think outside of the box   I have a friend who if she caught covid would almost surely die She struggles to breathe as is  Myasthenia Gravis  and always has low oxygen sats She has required her CNAs to follow all the federal and state guidelines or quarantine without pay for two weeks So far it s working They need their jobs No guarantee that my friend or her CNAs won t get covid still but at least a risk reduction if you trust the carers  Care com is pretty good It may cost money to pay for one month but just DM a ton of different people  in every category  and you should get some good options Then cancel it after the month is about to renew I would also recommend reaching out to people in your church if you re religious Even if you re not many will be willing to help Lastly as a C5 complete quadriplegic I have decided that getting exposed to the virus is inevitable unless I want to stay in my house until there is a vaccine Obviously we all need to stay smart but it is unrealistic to think that you are not going to come in contact with people from the outside world Plus completely locking down can get very expensive quick  Where are you located  Nebraska I m my brothers full time caretaker He s C5   C6 incomplete At the moment during COVID we have had his Private Duty Nursing temporarily put on hold but I get paid through Easter Seals Contact your insurance company and see if you can get PDN through Easter Seals or a company like that It will be paid for through the insurance  Luckily we don t need to leave the house for much of anything We can get neighbors and family that lives close by to do any shopping we need and drop it off for us Most places deliver as well You can arrange to have medications delivered up to 90 day supplies Amazon will

hygiene trips into the world for the potential of me going back to work etc staying safe and keeping him safe I hear about how individuals at high risk should stay home but not all of their caretakers can Has anyone ever injured themselves from their spasms Hey I have a baclofen pump I promise it s better than oral meds AMA  My spasms are by far the worse in the morning as well I have experienced a fall due to my right leg just deciding to forget how to properly function and spaz out on me Good times  I ve kicked three CNA s and one PTA in the face because they didn t listen to my warnings No injuries though  Not quite what you re asking for but I broke a toe kicking my feet together in bed   I suspect people don t get injured from the spasms themselves because over time the spasms help retain bone density Purely a guess though  I ve broken nearly every toe nail off kicking walls I ve Knee ed my desk so hard my leg blew up like a balloon aand a leg spasm while going up a ramp tipped me backwards hitting my head   Mine are worse in the afternoon and just before bed and as much as I hate them i think I d miss them if my legs were just inert    Awesome  Thanks  Sorry if this is a lot   What were your spasms like before the pump and how do they compare now How long have you had it What was recovery from the surgery like How long did it take for you to get the  right dose    I guess I worry about it malfunctioning or not working or running out of medicine and having withdraws I m thinking of getting one My spasms are so bad and they last throughout the night so I can t sleep and I m on the highest dose of baclophen and dantreen During the day I just thump in my chair and if I move my legs I do the sewing machine effect How long did you get your implant I was told I need to wait a year before I get one   Damn man that sucks  Sometimes I feel like I m going to snap my bones in half Those are mainly first thing in the morning Any cases of covid19 with SCI patients We re all so broken the virus stays away lol I have a friend that is c6 quadriplegic that caught it Luckily he could go back home  From what I know as a provider about similar outcomes as the general population but I think it s super important to protect yourself and prevent infection because of respiratory comorbidities From what I ve heard officially we are not a higher risk category However with tetraplegic patients such as myself I would imagine respiratory problems however as this is a dry cough I ve heard from medical professionals that we should not be overly concerned  From the CDR foundation https   www christopherreeve org blog daily dose the coronavirus and spinal cord injury Provider here   Yes and let s just say it didn t go well  deleted There s also increased vulnerabilities because of self cathing or foleys And since CoVid has been linked with renal failure in some patients there s that comorbidity to contend with as well Can you tell us a bit more water wand Have you tried a water wand and had a problem with a leak  In my experience leaks from hose end attachments like nozzles or water wands are typically due to a problem with the hose washer    cheap and easy to replace  Make sure you use one that is resilient  An old rubber washer may get hard and be virtually useless    I don t imagine a T 4 injury would affect your grip but hose connections can be difficult to tighten even for the non handicapped  If you have a problem I suggest you use tools to get a firm seal  The need for tools can be mitigated somewhat by using a soft hose washer  If you need tools a channel lock pliers  or two  might be the best choice  Get one that moves between slots  to change the grip size  easily and does not slip out of its slot during use    And don t feel bad about using tools  I m not handicapped at all and I have a reasonably strong grip but I still need a pliers to tighten some hose connections leak free  hey thanks for that I was gonna come back on here and let others know that it was the hose The water wand still isn t great and leaks from the head but once we got a new hose it does t leak at the grip handle part anymore I guess the lesson learned here is don t skimp on a good hose Any campers here You might want to check out this tent if you are Very light at only 2 pounds and super easy to put up You should also go

it was incredible how independent it made me feel I can only imagine how it must have felt for him after 3 years  Thats amazing What city was this in that he was shot  hey do you need help setting up an onlyfans  RenoI have oneI ve written a guide with strategies on how to improve the immune system and stay well I glanced over your webpage and for the most part I think it contains good advice    though I m not so much into  natural  healing etc  as you seem to be   I can t say that you re wrong so won t comment further on that    A couple things caught my eye though  You speak of getting vitamin D from sunlight  which is fine  and from foods  From what I read sunlight can easily produce enough vitamin D to maintain your immune system  The caveat is that you may have to spend a fair amount of time with exposed skin in the sun    and production of vitamin D is inversely related to the darkness of your skin  as well as the amount of skin you cover with clothing     OTOH foods may not be a reliable source of vitamin D for two reasons  They don t necessarily contain very much vitamin D and they may contain vitamin D2 which is somewhat toxic in high doses   If I understand it right you d have to go to some trouble to poison yourself with vitamin D2 from foods just because they don t contain all that much   Hence the recommendation I myself am following is to take vitamin D3 capsules 2000 IU  50 micrograms  per day   Vitamin K probably should be treated with kid gloves  I am elderly and am taking aspirin as a blood thinner  My doctor has advised me not to eat a great deal of leafy greens because they contain vitamin K which aids blood coagulation and hence is exactly what I  don t  need  Recent news says that COVID 19 is causing strokes and heart attacks in young er  people due to small blood clots  I have no information one way or the other whether vitamin K is involved or would exacerbate this clotting   I also don t understand your comments about acidity   pH   I m a chemist so am well acquainted with these   In particular you state  Lemon water  Negates Acidic Body PH levels   Lemon water would be acidic    so how does it negate acidic pH levels    and why would you want to do so anyway  Hi I thought this post went to spam but maybe it didn t Great to hear from you   Yeah there are many distractions and so the amount of time spent outdoors is reduced significantly Foods have less Vitamin D but digesting them in distributed manner is more effective than all in one go It is difficult to calculate absorption rates  e g Magnesium Tablets vs Ionic   Ionic absorbs better Food even slower absorption probably but more efficient for quantities Out of the D3 2000 IU not all will be absorbed If I had a fillet of Salmon it lasts about 3 hours for me and I can really feel the effects greater than the tablets depending on how it was cooked  maybe because of the fat and combined components It can get really complicated   Your Doctor is for

more bed sores  Touchwood   Also use an air cushion when sitting in your wheelchair I use a Roho Quadtro Select High Profile cushion  I m not well versed in the matter at all but I did get a stage 3 bedsore on my butt prior to entering inpatient rehab They put me on a high protein diet to help the wounds heal repair I was also put on a 2 4 hour restriction on my wheelchair and was given a roho cushion during my stay  basically if I wasn t doing PT or OT I was on the bed  On the bed I was rotated every 2 hours and the wound healed within 2 weeks     Edit  I also had an alternating pressure

themiamiproject org participant research participation what are clinical trials clinical trials  I m not sure what level you are but I am a C5 6 and 7   complete from MVA Much stronger right arm than left When I was first hurt back in 2014 I was at the same point of desperation I found a stem cell trial to be enrolled in and was one of the lucky ones to be injected with like 40 million 20 above and 20 below my lesion Granted this was several years ago and perhaps stem cell therapies have come a long way since but not that I have found Regardless I woke up tied down and intubated once again in my life and not having any idea what the hell happened I should add the stem cells did nothing to improve my function and actually cause me to lose some left toe wiggles Time went on and I was eventually accepted into another clinical trial this time Dr Harkema s epidural stimulator trial in Louisville This called for a 2 year relocation I had just received my service dog and finally started to swallow the pill that I was chronically injured and I would just have to figure life out I threw myself into advocacy and played an instrumental role in Ohio passing a research grant for spinal cord injuries I wound up passing on the trial Life is certainly different and while I would do just about anything to get everything back I slowly learned how to navigate the new freeway of life It s not for everybody advocacy or adaptive sports or whatever else the community wants to throw at you But just know that you re far from being alone I wish you all the luck in wherever this

intentional but that s an awesome idea to incorporate them into the cuts I m still learning the editing process so I ll try that on my next video Any video ideas you think would be a good idea to make Getting harder to stay positiveI have moments but no I m not happy either It took me 2 two years to come to terms with how much I ve gained back  which isn t much for C5  That s when I was rediscovering how to be like the old me You re still there but in a different form Trust me you ll get there Finding out how just takes time   Once I figured out how to use a playstation controller is when I realized that not all was lost Started a company was part of creating a mobile game finished school got married then divorced I ve done more in the chair than out Cooking the laundry creating art walking a dog Life is nuts but some good can come out of this It s about what you do with what ya got now  My honest answer to you I ve been in a chair for coming up on 11 years from now I am a C6 complete quadriplegic after a diving accident after a day of drinking My honest answer you will have bits and times where you are happy but something about my past life I just can t let go of I m not depressed but I don t think I will ever be as carefree and happy as I was before my accident   I was truly free I was like you I lived my life at 100 miles an hour at a time Absolutely nothing holding me back I was 20 when I hurt myself But that doesn t mean your life now is going to be completely shit it s just gonna be different than it was You re going to do many things in this life that you never would have done in your old life and there s things in this life that you would ve never had to do had you lived your other life   But there s no going back even if you get 99  you ll still notice how you re missing a step here or step there   I asked myself every day why am here I don t know if I ll ever get an answer C5 Asia d 10 years post injury It s tough man I m not going to lie There are the good days and there are the bad days There are the good months and the bad months It all really comes down to your mentality You need to set achievable goals and really be frank with your inner dialogue This is some serious shit that happened to you so it s time to be serious about your thoughts   Surround yourself with people you love and start doing things you can do and that you enjoy Yeah maybe you can t do the things you did before but the world is vast and there are so many things you can do Don t knock it till you give it a try whatever it is   There are also so many organizations out there that assist in giving sci people a chance to do something like surfing in Hawaii or sky diving It s just hard at the moment with covid   It took me many years to overcome that dread feeling of not being able to do anything but once you see how people with a higher level of injury do things and how others with similar injuries do things it gets easier Learn your new body and know your limitations and never be afraid to ask for help You ll meet some people who are not down with disabled but there are way more people who can see past it and are okay with it   Your ego and pride has been shattered but it s something you will learn to rebuild Stay humble but confident It took you how many years as a kid to learn your physical limits and boundaries now it s time to relearn your new limits and boundaries   More than happy to chat Keep your head up cus it gets better Your support network is much larger than you think  There are so many things I miss And I just want it all back It s very frustrating and depressing I hope you have a counselor and a good support group I have to constantly remind myself to be thankful for the progress I have made and to keep pushing for more Life will learn a new normal eventually I hope for all of us Take care   Also 1000 feet is awesome And I figure if you can do that then you can build on that and you can eventually do more and more if your nerves still let you   With every new ability we wonder if this is the new normal But life is long and normal will shift and change     it s ok to feel discouraged   and you re right you may never be that happy again The question is whether you ll ever be happy in any capacity and given what you ve written I think it s a very good chance the answer is yes   If it s only been a year it sounds like you are doing well A lot of people say it takes 5 years to  adjust  to your new life and I ve seen that be true 1 year you re still grieving or even just starting to grieve the loss of your old life  seems like you re just starting based on this post    Allow yourself to grieve If you don t feel better in 5 years then you can start worrying but no need to worry right now I think everyone who was injured felt the same way at 1 year  Hey dude   Sorry you re struggling It s understandable you haven t been hurt that long I am a c6 complete coming up on 14 years I think it s important to grieve but it s also import to know that your attitude determines your quality of life I always use the cliche saying there s no use crying over spilt milk Life is hard life can even suck but if you solely focus on the negatives you will only see the negatives I don t mean to dismiss your feelings but things will get better I promise Use your pain for fuel  I feel outa place in these incomplete discussions but there is so much hope to recovery in your situation Even if your mind isn t with it fight like hell to wear out your body for a goodnights rest   There were some of us that woke up from a coma and couldn t move or feel ANYTHING below our injuries There was no recovery Our rehabs sent us home after a couple weeks cause they knew nothing was moving And we re still out here fighting   You can do this Best of luck from Cali   Hey there  It s been several days but just seeing this now so apologies for a late reply I hope you are feeling a bit better today  I have a similar injury  T6 T7 inc  and am in a similar recovery situation as you  June will be 2 years for me  A lot of what has been typed above rings true so I won t repeat  I don t subscribe to the 1 year or 18 mo Max recovery model that the PT people spout  I m still experiencing improvements constantly  The problem is that they are very slow SLOW  But when I think of where I am at today compared to the first day home 16 mos ago  I am encouraged  I wonder where I will be in 1 year from now  2 years  In the meantime I feel you  This sucks worse than anything and there are days I just want to die  I see my life ticking by and I m not doing all the fun things I had planned on doing   I ll see someone jogging  running used to be my thing  or a couple holding hands and it ll ruin my whole day internally  But as is typed above   there are good times also  For me this injury has made space to work on intellectual and mental expansion I probably wouldn t have had when I was a whole   normal person moving at 100 mph through life  The thing about this new life is that everything takes so long to do  Many  simple  things require some sort of problem solve or work around whereas before we didn t even have to think about it  It sucks every day  But there are things that you can do now that you couldn t before   there are things you ve been through now that you know would just melt all those  Norms  you envy  Those are a couple examples of how you might find power in the very adverse situation you find yourself living through  Stay strong      you aren t alone  This is so great of a response it s just what I wish I could communicate to everyone newly dealing with this huge loss Depression after hospital stay T4 T6 incompleteJust getting out of the hospital  rehab sucks I spent less than a week in icu and hospital before I went to rehab Then I couldn t stay there because my pelvis was being held together by steel rods that fixed to an external carbon fiber frame This meant I couldn t actually do rehab and if I stayed id use up all the time my insurance allowed for rehab All in all it really took me a good 8 12 months before I felt like I could actually live again It gets better but it takes time the best thing you can do for yourself right now is to stay busy Don t get stuck in your head and dwell on how everything is wrong instead just focus on the little victories Being able to move in a chair is better than being stuck in bed Little wins over time are the key   For your bathroom issue I don t know how far it is but you could try getting a bench and transferring to the bench slide down it and transfer to the toilet Thinking outside the box is the only way to get over some hurdles Life can only get better if you work twords it and even though some times all you want to do is shut down you have to force yourself out of that hole and fight Don t be afraid to ask for help either it s a hell of a lot easier said than done but quitting is just not an option  Are you interested in seeing a therapist   When I had my first surgery C2 T1 posterior decompression and fusion I was immobile for 4 weeks I had a 4 year old and a newborn I could not even hold the baby My wife had to take care of me two kids and everything else I felt so helpless because I literally could not do anything I was so drugged up that I didn t even remember the first few weeks of recovery   My sleep schedule flipped I was up all night and sleeping all day Being awake at night with everyone asleep was so difficult because my mid was racing I eventually had a breakdown because I just felt so terrible that I wasn t contributing   A therapist really helped me through it I still see her almost 10 years later I would suggest you consider it   Hope everything works out for you  I second the therapy idea  You need someone to talk to who you don t have any feelings of guilt toward someone you can just tell all of your fears to  Tell the therapist right upfront that you are worried they will judge you  Tell them you are afraid to take medications that may change you too much  Therapists are trained to be non judgemental  And if you don t like the first one you talk to find another one  Don t worry about offending them    this is you and your family s well being on the line   Right now you re dealing with deep feelings of inadequacy frustration and shame  This is like the unholy trinity of emotions many people experience post SCI  LOTS of us here have felt what you re feeling or we re even currently feeling it  You re not alone   There s often a grieving period that people need to go through  Your life has changed your plans for your future have likely changed and it may feel like the  old you  is gone  It s OK to be sad about this  In fact you need to grieve over this in order to begin moving on  A therapist can help support you through this    If you can tell your family that you are experiencing depression and are concerned enough about it that you feel you need a professional to help you through it  Hopefully they will understand and will continue to be supportive  They may offer to listen if you need to talk which is sweet but like someone who isn t a doctor can t fix a broken leg someone who isn t a therapist can t fix clinical depression  Please be gentle with yourself and give yourself some time to grieve Your injury was a loss and it took me way too long to realize this after my SCI Everything you are feeling is so normal I prayed to be able to go to the bathroom on my own even more than I prayed for mobility again That shame is so toxic and difficult to deal with But your family loves you and wants to help And you will not feel so helpless forever  I promise it will get better And I also completely understand the imposter feelings as someone with an incomplete SCI I can walk with a cane now 6yrs after my injury Keep some room for hope   faith  Sending so much love your way You re not a fraud The majority of SCIs are incomplete and come with vigorous rehab to get back to walking and recovery This is the most important time to give it your best and be strong for your family And I don t mean the emotional part I mean the physical   Your emotions will stabilize but it could take years Be patient with yourself on that one I was actively suicidal for almost 3 years after my injury Just barely coming to my foundation in this new life   Manage your diet well and try not to gain too much weight I put on 60 pounds since the hospital but have dropped 20 in the last year and still dropping Exercise rehab and that person you were before is waiting for you on the other side of this struggle She s just a little less mobile and will prob have a drier sense of humor All my best to you Good luck When I first came home I was completely dependent moved in with my grandma and she had to take care of me change my diapers give me shots etc this time will come to pass It seems like a life time I know from experience Don t give up things will get better 24  m  c 4 incomplete quadriplegic  I m considering it but I m afraid he she won t help or just judge me and I don t want to be prescribed anything that will radically alter me How s everyone doing in quarantine Bored out of my mind Although now I have no excuse not to lift every day Everybody make sure to bust out your spirometer and get some exercise if possible   https   www acsm org blog detail acsm blog 2020 03 30 exercise immunity covid 19 pandemic  I m used working and going out in the weekends And covid tanked both of those

I can get hugs and kisses throughout the day I m doing well  How about you OP  With non emergency surgeries canceled I m hoping to schedule a C3 to C7 posterior laminectomy and fusion to go along with previous anterior C7 T1 and C5 C6 I ve gone from being fairly active and fit to lying in bed and sitting around in the last few months Feeling useless while my wife does most everything Trying to limit the pain meds Absent a traumatic accident many people don t understand nerve pain weakness and associated symptoms because they can t see it until it starts wasting your body  I ve been

Playing lots of call of duty and doing a software boot camp to beef up my React skills Just staying inside since I can t cough very well if I catch the plague But am taking some strolls outside my neighborhood for exercise with sunlight     So bored Finally cleaned out the garage now to dust off my workout equipment it s been too long Thanks for the blog link I recently took up shadow boxing it s super accessible and a killer workout Haha and that s good Watching anything good How do you like the assisted living facility   I have seen those controllers How are you liking it Think it ll work

been playing on there Skyrim had been my go to anyone know what these spots could be they aline perfectly with my spinal cord They look like the beginning of pressure sores Are they blanchable when you press on them What are you lying on  Agree pressure sores I think you need more cushion on your back rest Definitely have someone treat them and keep an eye on them  pressure sores scare me  Demons Do you have a SCI Are you in a wheelchair  I had that happen to me but at the top of my back I m pretty active so it was a bruise Finally diagnosed the problem on my own Dumb general doctor and my spinal doctors sent me too have x rays and shit Couldn t find anything I ordered a new backrest cushion and it went away in 2 weeks One thing I do when I m in my chair for hours at a time and not moving I ll kinda flip over on my sides so I m kinda on my hip  Yeah grade one Likely from a back rest Agreed Looks like pressure sores from spinous process of each vert the spots are not directly on

little more on what you want to accomplish and why it s important for other people with spinal cord injuries Your introduction is a little vague and then you jump right into how to make a bingo board before you have really sold your concept Combine that with editing out your distractions and it will be a lot easier for people to get on board with what you are wanting to accomplish Great work keep

s good news This means you still have a connection to that muscle   This is how I have gained a lot of function back after my injury T5 incomplete   Once you get movement in a muscle that you can watch with your eyes it s like your brain remembers and finding more muscle groups are easy   I was told I would never regain anything because I had a significant injury with multiple broken vertibrae and severed portions of my cord  about 10   but I have regained all of my right leg my bowel a little bit of bladder  I can void 80  of my bladder  about half of my core and  most important  my sexual function I still can t walk due to a poor left leg and core but I m still working on it   Just keep sending the message down to that area over and over The first movement I got was in my quads I had the same feeling with the nerve pain just kept pretending in my head to hop in an out of bed It took 3 months to get the first decent result but within 12months I could walk in a standing frame with a left leg AFO   It s hard work mate but the extra function does make a difference like I drive a normal automatic car with no controls etc I sort of even got to a point after 5 years where I stopped training because other than walking I am just normal  still sucks though     Anywayz I hope this gives you a bit of MOJO hit me up if you want to ask anything  Nerve pain is funny like that It always feels somewhat like sand paper on my ass but over time it s just become the norm You can see your doctor and try never pain meds such as gabapentin  I have major nerve pain and spasms And get the same thing you do when you focus on something to move One thing that helps my nerve pain and spasms a ton is getting in the standing frame and getting on the floor or any hard surface and stretching the crap out of them From what I understand it s almost like the spinal cord has its own memory Your injury may not be as complete as you think with some sensory function breaking through  About me  July 6th 2019 I was shot in the back point blank range with a Glock 40 All my doctors at the time and my doctors at rehab 3 months later said it is 100  a complete injury I m a T5 complete they said   I quickly glanced over this last night and tried what you said In about an hour span I managed to move my toes TWICE It was a sort of weird twitchy movement but I immediately just  knew  that was me doing it somehow   When you say severed to me that s a complete because when I think of severing something for some reason my brain registers that as cut completely through Care to indulge me about that   How long ago were you injured How long after injury did you start to regain those little periodic movements   I m still unable to freely do it of course as last night I was only to accomplish it twice However it has lifted my spirits to a new apex post injury   Since they say I m complete maybe it s just my mind playing tricks on me sand paper on your ass XD that made me chuckleI ve been on that ever since it happened All it really does is slightly numb it for me The pins and needles and burning in my feet and legs never stopThe beachRent a beach wheelchair Get a motorized one if you can my city has a walkway down over the sand and they have beach chairs for rent  for free they hold my ID to make sure I bring it back  I always go with my friends and they push me because there aren t motorized ones available we just bring the normal stuff  swimsuits towels sunglasses sunscreen snacks and drinks I always bring an extra towel to put over my legs during the sunniest part of the day  if we don t go to one of the restaurants or bars across the street  because sunburns can cause AD I also always bring crocs or water shoes crocs stay on my feet better and water shoes protect my feet from scrapes if I get in the water   when i m getting back into the beach chair from the ground one of my friends holds the chair still to keep it stable I don t have much trouble with it it s not much harder for me than a normal floor to chair transfer I also put a towel under my feet so my feet don t slide on the sand  Question for the IncompletesI was also injured on June 10th 2 years before you though weird    I m incomplete and can walk unassisted I have various degrees of muscle control on both my legs some spots I can feel and move just like I could pre accident others I can move but have very limited sensation in them Best way I can describe it is as if those muscles are asleep numb but I can still move them   Sometimes things came back quickly I could suddenly move muscles in the afternoon that I couldn t move in the morning other ones came back so slowly I didn t even realize they came back at all until I looked back on things   I know I probably didn t touch on everything you asked so feel free to ask anything specifically that I may have missed  C5 incomplete  Keep as active and as healthy  diet  as you can  Muscle is easier to maintain than grow back  Hydrotherapy  Pilates  The boring stuff works  Efs C5 incomplete here Was injured July 2019 Continuous interaction with anything that touched my legs and feet allowed for a daily increase in sensation Massage therapy seemed to help quite a bit I at one point was not able to feel warm or hot water on my feet I rubbed my feet periodically throughout the day despite the uncomfortableness dipped them in hot water then cold then hot and on and on   I m not 100  with sensation in my legs but I would say sensation is about 85  there with slight tingling and a strange numbness   My therapist told me to continue to irritate any new feeling if sensation The nerves are hyperactive and increased activity will allow for eventual increase in sensation with normalized feeling I m not a medical professional   this is just what was told to me and how I combatted low sensation  I am c6 c7 incomplete almost 11 years out As of about a year ago I was still getting sensation return I can feel both of my legs but they are a little numb tingly I can feel pain pressure and sometimes temperature Temp just started recently and is patchy When I was in rehab I could just barely move my one big toe As of now I can move 5 toes on my left foot and can wiggle my foot a little It s definitely possible to be getting return years out Have you thought about acupuncture Would that be something available to you I found a great guy and I swear that I can feel energy and nerves when he puts needles in below my sensation level I also see a deep tissue masseuse she is a life saver with keeping my pain level down They work together to try and keep me as balanced as possible  Thanks for taking time to reply  We re you able to walk unassisted all along or did you spend time in a wheel chair   Almost 4 years out are you still seeing changes   improvements or has it leveled off   Congratulations on your recovery I was injured June 10th 2010 Small world Anybody get a tattoo I ve gotten 3 They are on my arms though Skin was fine just made sure to keep it clean and take care of it so it didn t get infected That was the biggest risk of getting a tattoo in my case  I have two big ones on both my thighs and both sleeves with my hands as well They turned out great But my tattoo I just had to be a little patient when doing my legs because of spasms I m c6 I have a few I have one down my right rib cage and I m a T 5 complete Be carful tattooing your injury line is all I ll say lol Didn t think of that  I ve got one on my arm and it went absolutely fine I intend to get more  Whats your injury level I m a t2 t3  was worried about my skin The ability to continue moving when you are feeling scared fearful or lazy is the sign of true mental strengthHey I know that room it s Shepherd Center You re definitely in good hands with them  Looking good bro Keep up the good work and you ll be ditching that walker in no time Any background context into what happened  Yeah either that or an incomplete spinal cord injury  Aaayee Shepherd Center  Let s goooo Glad to see an SCI patient making progress to walking How long ago was your injury  I got shit to complain about   Are you sure Maybe today is the day when I ll finally get the mental strength to overcome a complete spinal injury who knows I could be out jogging by tomorrow afternoon  sSurvey about body staging and exoskeletonsWhat worked to solve your incontinence Botox Botox is amazing Nothing is better   I had incredible bladder struggles for almost 15 years Originally did oxy tried a bunch of other medications but always had ultra sensitive bladder which would spasm and void everything and low capacity   150   200 ml  so I d have to cath every 2 4 hours   After 200 units of botox  every 6 months  I cath ever 12 hours can go up to 18 hours if needed Capacity is  600 ml and even hit 850 ml once  I was in a lot of pain though  I use botox every 6 months it s heaven  Suprapubic catheter I used to straight cath every 4 hours  if I could make it that long  I had problems with bladder spasms I would always have to wear a condom cath to prevent getting wet  It became a real pain with cathing and putting on a condom cath several times a day I have hand impairments  C5 C6   I got a suprapubic catheter several years ago haven t regretted it at all  A friend tried Myrbatriq and Toviaz Their secondary effects were severe enough that the med was more harm than help I think he went back to oxybutanin   a low dose of an antibiotic   Myself oxybutanin was effective when used acutely but it had to be bad enough to ride out the secondary effects I switched to a hydrophylic catheter which solved UTIs and the addition of Detrol LA 4 mg has been effective for 13 years   A capsaicin treatment didn t work for me   Hope that adds to your options to explore  Fecal transplant I had and augmentation and stoma surgery 14 years ago I am a woman so the stoma helps me put my catheter in and out without having to fin the urethra  I helped tremendously with UTI plus no more accidents  Same but 200 every 4 months How long have you been doing botox injections I m happy an SP works for you It was an absolute nightmare for me Hated everything about it And I had UTI literally constantly Ended up switching to intermittent cath and I m never going back Lol already had that to fix cdiff don t want either of those again Spinal Cord Stimulator Pros Cons deleted  Pros  Significant pain relief Less reliance on pharmaceuticals Control over settings timing Potential for  set it and forget it   You could always turn it off   Cons  Biggest risk I ve seen is failure over time in that it slowly just stops helping Obviously with any implanted device risk of infections bleeding etc  Others include lead breakage migration   Overall  I ve seen very impressive results with stimulators when more conservative options fail I believe overall they re underutilized  I hope that can happen for you I have an idiosyncratic reaction to the heavy hitters I have to be really careful with what I can take I can tell you this is no quality of life though  as I am certain you know I am really sorry it failed for you May I ask what you use for relief now Thank you for this informative response I have an idiosyncratic response to the heavy hitters so most prescriptions are out of the question I also have Ehlers Danlos I was referred to a Neurologist for that reason I keep dreaming that I m walking againHaha I still walk in my dreams but I m totally aware that I can t It s so weird  I am not paralyzed but my brother died 5 years ago and I dream of him all the time as if he is alive but I know he is dead at the same time The first year he died I had dreams every night of us hanging out and he was alive but rotting I feel like your dreams are a way of grieving the life you once had just like my dreams are remembering the brother I once knew  13 years now and in most of my dreams I m able bodied Some I m in a chair And a few I m running around normal but aware I m not supposed to be I kinda hate those lol Able body sex dreams are the best Till you wake up in utter disappointment    Bro  I have those exact same dreams  Perfect down to the waddle walk or limp or skip   Almost five years since my injury  In my dreams I m afraid to stop walking in case I can t start again  Me too    I m at the point now that I m aware I can t walk in dreams and I fall I have recurring ones where I m driving but realize I can t move my legs and feet and I crash This seems to be a normal phenomenon I have those dreams as well About half of my  walking dreams  my body is perfectly fine just like pre injury and half of them is me walking and riding a bike funny while it lingers in my head  you re not supposed to be able to do this    The other night I dreamt that I were working my way through some kind of obstacle course with Joe Rogan Haha  Totally the same here Same kinds of dreams too  Same here I just woke up from a dream where it was my first time biking to work since my accident and I was so happy in my dream it went well I really miss being able to walk and bike to work  May I ask how long ago you were injured And how do you cope with said dreams I can t help but feel these dreams are my body trying to communicate with me in a way Like it s saying  just get up it s all you gotta do You got this I ve had a few dreams like these Luckily my wife has always been in the car with me every time and I manage to downshift the car enough to slow us down so she can gain control of the vehicle as we re barreling towards something JRE is my shit You just made a new friend Not gonna lie not being able to enjoy sex has been the hardest part for me to cope with Watching your beautiful wife enjoy you while you have to reminisce better daysJune 11 I was in a terrible car accident causing brain damage abdominal damn along with a severed spine with a spinal cord injury A few doctors told me I would never walk again I stand before you with the strength and will power to show NO MAN DEFINES MY DESTINY Congratulations dude    When I had my additional injury I went to rehab with a guy that got injured on the same day had surgery the same night and we both got fitted for our wheelchairs on the same day I was in a manual Quickie GT and he was in a power chair steering it with a sip n puff I felt horrible for myself but I felt worse for him naturally However he had a much different kind of injury than I did and his recovery was miraculous Weeks later while I was struggling to just sit upright without flopping over this guy comes scooting in the rehab gym using a walker I was cheering him on and told him that he s my inspiration My rehab people told me to be very careful with my expectations because just like you ve demonstrated spinal cord injury recovery is an unpredictable thing that requires patience and the ability to accept whatever the outcome eventually is Rehab is a tremendous amount of work and you get out of it what you put into it but people need to understand that that guy I went to rehab with and you are ALSO  tremendously lucky  After six months if you re not walking again it s not because you weren t trying hard enough or your doctors PT OT are inept That s just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes But if you don t like what your doctors are telling you get a second opinion  Good for you brother My recovery albeit not nearly as successful as yours came in waves and lasted a long time Hold on to that attitude even if things slow down It s a good fight to take  You look awesome One of the tough things about SCI recovery is none of us know where our goal line will be or what we can expect out of our bodies We just gotta keep chugging along and working our butts off till we get there Keep chugging You re doing amazing  You re amazing Let s goo   Keep it up brother  Bro FUCK YES  This is so amazing  Keep it up dude  D Good effort You are still in early days of recovery so anything is possible Best of luck to you  My husband needs one of these but he s too tall for one  he s 6 7 Very inspiring man  Very good to see  I literally just collapsed into a chair after doing 8 minutes on a walker  T7 incomplete and 2 years in chair post spinal cord surgery on June 10th   and only 8 minutes and it just wastes me  Was thinking some negative thoughts like I m never going to be able to  Yama Yada Yama  You know what I m talking about I m sure  Reached for my iPad and saw your video  Thank you  I m going to keep trying  Posted Below In Wrong Place so Re Posting   How far are you able to go   how long has it taken you to recover this level of function  Thanks again  Were u wearing a seatbelt  awesome dude keep it up you will get better and better we all look forward to seeing it  Exactly No doubt it takes a lot of effort for the people who are able to get some motor control back and it s fantastic that they do but each SCI is very different and it isn t from a lack of effort that some people don t walk again     Some sites of injury are so severe that no strength or will power can force axonal growth across the site of injury or make glial scarring disappear the same way an amputee can t just try really hard to regrow a limb     This guy s progress is amazing and he should certainly celebrate but it s important to realise that we don t always know to what extent luck has worked in our favour Your amazing  I m going to tell some of my story tomorrow Hopefully we can communicate and I can get so advice Thank you so much for the positivity   encouragement Yes all my damage came from a seatbelt holding me in placeCollagen Peptidesnot collagen supplements specifically but when I am developing a pressure sore I make sure i m getting extra protein I think collagen is a protein so I can see how it could be helpful but I haven t tried  Chemist here  Collagen is protein but contains a the  imino  acids called  proline  and  hydroxyproline    These are essentially cyclic  amino  acid but you really don t need to understand even that much   There are 20 essential amino acids    ones that cannot be synthesized in our bodies    but these two imino acids are not among those 20  Hence there is no absolute dietary requirement for these   However it seems that when you eat proteins high in these imino acids they benefit connective tissue in your body    including hair and nails  Your body does not need to convert another amino acid  glutamic acid I believe it would be  into these imino acids   Since skin contains a lot of connective tissue if follows that eating proteins that contain these imino acids would benefit the skin  I have not looked into whether there be research to support this conclusion   I see no particular benefit to eating collagen  peptides   which are derived from collagen by cleaving it somehow probably enzymatically  as opposed to eating the collagen itself  Gelatin cooked connective tissue including skin and even tendon and cartilage    if cooked soft    are good sources   I do eat all these things BTW so this is not mere speculation    It s worth noting that vitamin C is essential to the formation and maintenance of connective tissues in the body  Scurvy is the last stage of vitamin C deprivation and basically amounts to your body falling apart for lack of connective tissue   Myself I take between 500 and 3000 mg vitamin C per day    the higher end now as it also supports the immune system   ARA 290 Preface  I m a medical researcher involved in clinical trials I d never heard of this agent My initial thoughts   1  ARA290  https   pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound Cibinetide  also known as Cibinetide also known as pyroglutamate helix B surface peptide  PHBSP  is a patented agent  2 The publication you posted is from a  registered clinical trial  RCT   https   www clinicaltrialsregister eu ctr search search query 2010 021518 45  that was started in 2010 The

nerves This isn t bad but it raises the   throw shit on the wall and see what sticks   red flag This is because most of the time a pharmacological agent has a specific target e g  it talks to a receptor that exists on a specific tissue  e g  neurons or renal cells or skin cells  that is involved in a disease   I know I m not providing you with answers regarding the agent s potential effects But hopefully this helps with your research  Im interested having sugary on my spine next Monday and have a lot of nerve damage Wondering dosages and length of cycles  Really appreciate the response Your points make complete sense Thanks for the industry insight I like you Hi I have small fiber neuropathy and have been reading about ARA290 I saw your post from a while ago and wonder if you have any updated information Also do you have any opinion on buying this from an online source like peptide sciences and self administering Thank you for your insight Likely hasn t caught on because it seems to cure the neuropathy instead of treating it so it s much less profitable My research has shown dosages of 4mg day for thirty days Many peptides work synergistically with others Running a generally accepted as safe peptide like BPC 157  the stabilized arginine version  along side it would most likely be beneficial BPC dosage is 500 to 750 mcgs 2X day BPC is probably the most widely used and accepted peptide to help with healing This is not medical advice and although both of these have been available with Rx from compounding pharmacies they are mostly considered research chemicals Insurance does not cover them or the supplies needed Good luck with surgery Nerve pain sux What type of bed do you all sleep on With any sleeping surface you need to keep in mind pressure wound prevention The hospital bed recommended likely is the surface your doctor medical provider recommended so if you are at high risk talk to them before switching That being said I ve known a number of individuals with SCI that have self purchased a sleep number bed and love it You can adjust the firmness and certain models have the articulating frame so you can raise head of bed leg part if it makes moving around easier for you  I use a posture pedic that changes positions Its not a hospital bed you can purchase them un any store DH is 30 years out next month he s always slept in a

about other communities I should reach out to that would be very helpful Best cavilon to protect against pressureWhen you say pressure sore prevention what do you mean Obviously there are many ways to prevent pressure sores Cavilon has many uses  My wound care consultant recommended using Cavilon on areas that are prone to pressure like heal ankles sacral area etc I couldn t recall if he meant use the cream or spray Working In healthcare with nerve damage after Spinal Cord InjuryI don t have any experience with this but every program has technical standards requirements which you would be required to meet  For example     The student must have the motor control and coordination to perform physical examinations through inspection palpation auscultation and percussion in order to elicit information  He or she must be able to perform laboratory procedures clinical skills and diagnostic maneuvers with and without the use of equipment In addition the student must be able to bend manipulate lightly lift to approximately twenty five pounds and assist patients   or    The individual must have sufficient strength and coordination to perform the activities required of a physician assistant These include performing a physical examination involving techniques in palpation and percussion and utilizing diagnostic instruments The individual must have sufficient stamina to sit stand and move within the classroom laboratory examination rooms treatment rooms and operating rooms for extended periods of time They must have sufficient coordination to move about patient care environments and sufficient dexterity to use common medical instruments The individual must have sufficient motor function and execute movements required to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients Examples of emergency treatment required for physician assistants are cardiopulmonary resuscitation administration of intravenous medication application of pressure to stop bleeding the opening of obstructed airways and suturing of simple wounds Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch and vision     The individual must possess sufficient visual auditory and tactile sensation to receive appropriate information in the classroom laboratory clinical and other education settings  Sensation must be sufficient to receive verbal and non verbal information while interviewing patients and to perceive signs of disease identified through patient evaluation involving inspection percussion palpation and auditory information at various frequencies  i e  patient voice heart tones bowel and lung sounds  All of these are essential for the evaluation and treatment of the patient   or    PA students must have sufficient visual and auditory ability to observe in lecture learner laboratory and patient care settings Sensory skills required in the performance of complete physical examinations utilizing inspection percussion palpation and auscultation include adequate vision hearing smell and tactile sensation All senses must be sufficient to observe a patient s condition and elicit information through history and physical examination     Sufficient physical stamina is required to complete the rigorous didactic and clinical portions of the program The didactic phase of the program requires extended sitting in contrast to the clinical phase which requires extended standing and moving about various clinical facilities PA students must be able with or without accommodation to elicit information from patients and perform a physical examination In addition they must be able to perform therapeutic and diagnostic procedures in addition to negotiating various health care environments such as outpatient facilities laboratories and hospitals Students must have sufficient motor function to execute movement s essential to provide general and emergency care to patients Some examples of emergency care reasonably required of physician assistants is cardiopulmonary resuscitation administration of intravenous medication the application of pressure to stop bleeding the opening of obstructed airways the suturing of simple wounds the handling of surgical instruments and the performance of basic obstetrical maneuvers Additionally the ability to use the electronic medical record as well as take the national physician assistant certification examination which does not offer paper testing necessitate that students are able with or without reasonable accommodations to use computer and other electronic devices  I know someone with a C4 complete injury who went to medical school after her injury and is now a doctor She cannot use her hands so she works with an assistant who helps with notes and physical exams You should reach out to your school and or employers and see if any accommodations can be made Your journey will be harder It is certainly risky to go into a career that demands such high physical strength and fine gross motor coordination As an OT or PT in many settings  Ex home health care acute care skilled nursing facility  it is literally your job to advance the physical and motor skills of your patients WHILE keeping them safe Can you very quickly grasp a patient that is about to take a tumble When a vent tube pops off their trach in the middle of the session will you be nimble enough to simultaneously hold onto the patient and with your other hand resecure the tubing so the patient can breathe Are you able to transfer heavy people with their own significant mobility limitations  I m not saying it s impossible You could certainly go into a niche field or teaching and I think your personal experience with injury and recovery is invaluable  Source  An OT who has mostly moved out of acute care and into the role of professorship due to a  very mild  spinal cord injury TBI  I am graduating with my DPT from Jefferson university next month In the cohort above us we had a woman who had an upper extremity amputation and she succeeded and did very well in the program as well as in her early career Like others have said it will take more time effort and possibly frustration as you will have to find techniques that work for your body to reach the objectives My experience is that gross motor strength is more significant in this field I fully support you going for it and if you need any additional information about PT school let me know  I m sorry you had that injury that sounds like quite a challenge Your studies are hard enough without that on top of it   There s a couple of aspects here Can t speak to physical therapy hopefully someone else pipes up from their profession You could very likely find a rewarding career as a PA where your possible limitations aren t an issue  psych comes to mind  However it s getting through school that presents some serious barriers The good news is that schools tend to go pretty far working with folks who need accommodations they tend to be pretty good about that sort of thing At the same time standards and requirements are important and there s only so far accommodations can get you Frankly this seems quite specific and particular to you and may depend on additional details   Surgery rotations in particular come to mind as something that could be quite difficult Standing for extended periods of time without moving while holding traction as well as suturing tying can be physically demanding and require fine motor skill With experimentation you may find certain techniques are less problematic  one hand tie for example  That said there are often a range of possible rotation sites and preceptors and one may be available with foresight and planning that could be more accommodating I would honestly recommend contacting a school close to you with specific questions  Someone here when the sub just got created posted about her husband being a doctor who had graduated fro yale medical school and was extremely accomplished in his field I don t know if that person is still around but it s defintely a doable  That is an incredible story much respect for her perseverance Dealing with sensations on top of my headI get this every once in awhile from smoking weed and so do a few friends I think its the HTC Cbd It never worried my friend or me and comes and goes  I think it s tension  I get the sensations multiple times a day But your comment is interesting because THC and CBD have been shown to reduce spasms and spasticity and I can confirm that it works for me It seems strange that it would help me throughout my body but cause new symptoms on or in my head r DisabilityArtTrach left in too longIs he breathing on his own No mechanical ventilation That is the important first step He has to be weaned off of mechanical ventilation I do not know where is injury was but some people can be off a ventilator  mechanical ventilation  for periods of time and then go back on Ask to participate in their weekly care conference or set up a complex care meeting with all members of the interdisciplinary team Explain that this is a concern and ask for a speech therapy evaluation They should introduce a  Passy Muir Valve  https   www passy muir com  gclid Cj0KCQjw Mr0BRDyARIsAKEFbeeJc6WofW3fcYM_uNHLhmw1G3BeZzGGWYfzwEKc0qxT BXJkw5AyCAaAl5pEALw_wcB  This allows for trial breathing through the mouth eating and speaking etc This could be called by other names such as speaking valve Utilizing this for trials throughout the day will ensure that he can tolerate breathing talking and eating with the trach tube sealed off Once they determine he can tolerate having the tube sealed off they can pull the trach tube out While frustrating it s not uncommon to have a trach tube in for several months even up to a year At least that s my experience as a nurse Others may have different experiences Regardless it is important for you or your family to continue to advocate for your Uncle Even if they are not doing anything with it right now the team should be explaining why they are not being more aggressive with getting it out  Sometimes people don t need assistance breathing  ie  ventilator  but they need a trach the be able to take adequate breaths on their own Is the trach capped and has it been for a while with no issues If so I think it s reasonable to ask if his medical team about decannulation If not they are likely focused on other aspects of his recovery and rehabilitation right now and he still needs the trach   FYI the typical progression from having an open trach is first use of a Passey Muir valve sometimes called a speaking valve This still allows air in but all exhales occur more naturally and allow a person to speak Then usually they will trial capping Then if the person is able to tolerate being capped  basically the trach is not in use  for extended time without adverse effects they will consider removing the trach The above sequence is done under supervision guidance of either a physician or speech and language pathologist Not everyone ends up getting the trach removed and may plateau at any point and the time it takes to progress to each level is highly dependent on the person s individual factors   I think it s wonderful you are looking to advocate for your family member Definitely ask questions to the medical professionals that are working with him They will know his specific circumstances best Hope this helps  Find out the injury level and prognosis Ask about the speaking valve Be persistent They left mine in for a week or so too long despite my concerns only through persistence was it removed My fianc e had his trach in for over a year after his initial accident He had the intubation tube down his throat for twice as long as you re supposed to due to complications so a lot of scar tissue had developed in his throat They had to do different procedures to try and remove the scar tissue so that his throat was open above the trach and after being tired of hearing the  wait and see how this one goes  we got a second opinion and less than 4 months later the trach was out   It s my understanding that as long as he s still using a vent in any capacity they ll leave the trach in If he has any other respiratory issues or if scar tissue has developed it most likely won t be as simple as taking it out He ll also have to pass a swallow test and see a speech therapist before they ll remove it from our experience  May I ask what level his injury is at  As someone who has been in exactly your uncle s position I can say that it is a very difficult situation Having the ability to use your speech is in itself a major improvement on your life opportunities I was on one for four months but I was eventually able to recover Again this depends on everyone and might take much longer for your uncle depending on the severity   I would strongly recommend speaking to his neurologist neurosurgeon and pulmonologist Get whomever who can talk about it to help you   Some things to let you know Depending on the level it may take longer to get off the trach and please keep that in mind Second when you have a trach depending on the severity of the respiratory health you can have it adjusted so as to allow air to move upward to the mouth so as to allow speech Third do you know that they are avoiding it   as in have you spoken to them or anyone you know Often the decision is also very difficult for doctors Fourth what is his level of mobility with his arm   is it limited or can he use his arm to function like normal in which case you can begin exploring using technology to bridge the gap temporarily That will also give a headstart later in life to explore other independence mechanisms  I had to use a ventilator for several weeks after my injury due to complications from my spinal fusion Even when I was able to breathe well enough on my own the doctors left the trach in for a few months to get through flu season They didn t want to have to intubate me or do another trach if things got bad Considering everything going on with the coronavirus maybe this could be what they re thinking  I ll add my weight for advocacy about Passy Muir valve use during the day If your uncle is still requiring ventilator support overnight then there ll be no question of the trach coming out until that support is no longer required but it s worth pushing the discussion in that direction My daughter was weaned off her vent over the course of a couple of weeks  her SCI is lower at T9 but she also suffered traumatic injuries to diaphragm and lungs  having been ventilated for more than two months The Passy Muir was a huge psychological boost   being able to speak was definitely a part of that but the milestones around the various SLP evaluations and swallow tests were important too   We  wife and I  were kept informed   in fact were actively encouraged to participate in and contribute to both the daily care briefings in ICU and later the weekly complex continuing care conference   I d also echo the suggestion from u billrn1999 to encourage your parents to make sure they re part of these discussions too Keep asking questions   I d be surprised and somewhat disappointed if a direct question doesn t receive a sensible answer And if that answer is  wait and see  then ask  why Wait for what see what     It s a scary and frustrating time for everyone and it s potentially more damaging to decanulate too early and then have to go in again if he requires breathing support in future Be bold in your advocacy but try not to get too upset when the answers aren t what you wanted to hear  This isn t with regard to the trach but is your family member making use of text to speech apps for communication  He s on a vent at night It s hard because my parents are the ones doing most of the communication with the doctors but I ll try to be more adamant about them taking more interest in it Thank you for your responseThank you Got it I guess more patience is needed I just feel so bad for him and I know he spends a lot of energy saying things twice and three times until we can read his lips correctly Thanks for your responseNot entirely sure how to describe it I haven t been in on the conversations with doctors and don t know the exact fractures he suffered but so far he is completely paralyzed neck down aside from one arm he can lift but no dexterity in the fingers I believe they re avoiding it simply because it was put in at a different hospital in another state and every time they are asked about it we are told to  wait and see   They could be keeping track of it it s just seems that they keep giving the excuse that they re worried about swelling when his accident was 3 months ago and his last surgery was a month ago His arm mobility is still low but that s something they re working on in rehab He has no dexterity in his fingers so unfortunately he s reluctant to try anything with it u oakvillein   Great information Thanks for sharing your story and experience with her Thank you Hearing everyone else s situation here makes me see that I just need to have patience and be supportive while still advocating for the best care Appreciate the responseHe has no dexterity in his fingers so he can t type unfortunately And he s reluctant and impatient to use a letter chart Tingling feelingI ve had it since day one after waking from surgery If I m in a quiet room and someone slams a car door in the parking lot or even just drops a fork on the floor it feels like an electric shock I used to have reoccurring dreams of falling forwards in slow motion out of a reclining chair When I reached the ground I would get one of these electric shocks in my dream Over and over This is what it felt like when I broke my neck originally No pain besides what felt like touching an electric fence   Is it possible you re experiencing PTSD symptoms  this is interesting bc whenever I heard sudden loud sounds now it s like an electric jolt in my stomach I m much lower  t10ish complete  and I get the same thing I definitely noticed it more when I first got hurt I mentioned it to my neurologist at the time and he didn t think much of it just that it was interesting Didn t seem to be concerned at all  I get that too when watching a scary movie or something It s wild  This has happened to me too  It happened much more often when I was first injured when it seemed my nerves were much more touchy   In fact the first two years I had something very weird going on  Whenever I heard a loud noise like a cabinet door slamming  my fucking legs would twitch  like they heard the noise  Even if I knew the slam was coming they would still jump like they got scared  And I have a complete injury  I don t know what the fuck was going on and I don t think my doctor believed me    Another thing ever since my injury I get goose bumps super easy now    the emotional kind  Like if I see a cat food commercial with a cute kitten where before I might have been like  Huh cute  and that s it now that commercial will make me break out in goose bumps all over my arms scalp and back  even though my mental reaction is still just  Huh cute   I m a c4 and it happens to me all the time The worst is when I m sleeping and something startles me awake It takes a minute or two for me to get back to baseline tingling again During the day it happens when doors slam or the dog barks unexpectedly but I get back to baseline faster I think it s because I m more relaxed at night so when I tense it s more obvious  I m a T9 and get this in my legs all the time Pretty used to it now so don t think about it but even large noises that I anticipate  like seeing a door slammed  creates that electric shock feeling  Hey it just occurred to me that a few times I would have gone insane without having a decent pair of comfortable earplugs the kind that aren t going to make your ears ache after hours of use  Secondly last year I got a pair of active noise canceling headphones They too have been a godsend   Just thinking that you might benefit from some increased peace and quiet  I have the exact same happen to me also c7 incompleteYou know possibly I didn t think about that I did get injured by a gunshot so maybe my brain is reconnecting with that soundI think it s just your nerves  I have a very similar reactions to your commercial thing I can see something sad and before it would just be like whatever it s sad but now it was crazy like a whole different reaction in my body but I can t obviously control itSo it does happen to everybody even when I m looking at something and I m expecting it I still get that shock thanks for the your input on thisI bought the Bose ones but because my everything is so sensitive I can barely stand them it s a terrible feeling I can have that s me without pain is really my face everything else comes with nerve pain or no pain but if it s on my head and it s pain especially my ears and my hair but thank you for the recommendation usually I just use the Amazon echo or my phone I do try to use the headphones every now and again especially if I m using the computerAnyone tried workout supplements and or stimulants Creatine is great protein is super necessary BCAAs are in protein you re not going to get anything from taking just BCAAs that you wouldn t get from complete protein sources  Lots of good research for plenty of supplements Creatine is one of the best IMO Personally creatine helped considerably with orthostatic hypotension  I need an abdominal binder to stand without creatine  with it I feel fine  strength and endurance Also like it for brain thinkin  It does however reliably produce a side effect for me My bladder spasms at lower than usual volumes and I have less time to get to the bathroom Over time I have developed a tolerance   take about 1 5g a day without huge affect to my bladder If I take a larger dose for any reason I have issues I d be very curious if anyone else has had this experience  This is very interesting   Also for those who are posting about their supplements could you also name the brand that you use There are a hundred different brands of creatine BCAAs and so forth  Hey very interesting post  Thanks  I have the same injury level as you  T6 T7 incomplete  and am trying to get out of the chair  Currently plateaud at 8 ugly minutes on a walker  I am 2 years post surgery which they say is  the injury  now and am continuing to slowly recover some sensation and more function  I am going to try your supplements and I hope you keep posting on this  That is pretty interesting I ve been taking Creatine for about a week now and haven t noticed anything like that Might still take some time before it saturates and I start feeling other effects Glad to hear you found a dosage though  DHopefully this works out   Creatine   BulkSupplements com Creatine Monohydrate  Micronized   1 Kilogram    https

but good with Viagra or Cialis   simulation Viagra works for a few hours comes with headache and congestion Cialis for a few days and less side effects Good enough for my girlfriend   I find vibration generally kills off an erection rather than helps one  There s a relatively new ferticare 2 0 which seems to work better than the other toys I ve tried Hitachi Viberect and TENS machines all seem to reduce erection  I am S2 S4 and mine gets like 1 100th stimulation but I have urethral separation so even if it got hard it wouldn t function On top of having zero sensation down there  I don t have the desire to feel or function I just want to be able to get hard so that I could at least perform the task  deleted Scared as hellAll these concerns should be brought up not only with your doctor but with your family and the whole team that is in charge of transitioning you back home As far as strength goes they re not going to send you to an environment that you can t handle without putting sort of adaptation in place whether that be some kind of stairclimbing system or just more time for strengthening  My fianc  sold our inaccessible house and bought an accessible condo on a Paratransit route and moved us in before I even made it out of rehab  Bring up that you don t have a plan for bowel accidents yet Think of all the scenarios and tell them where you stand such as  no I m not going to ever ask my teenage kid to do that   Your team I should know what you re capable of  at the time of discharge  and give you adaptive tools to make it easier to self toilet and put you in contact with home health agencies you can call if you find yourself sitting in poop at the foot of your bed with no one around willing to help   I m allergic to exercise but when I got home I found myself motivated simply to move myself around my big new condo and got more exercise than I ever bargained for  Our shit heel condo association wouldn t let us put hardwood floors in so instead we put in the lowest low ply carpet In a few short winter months my arms and shoulders were larger and had more definition than they ever had in my life just from pushing through all the fuzz I NEVER would ve gotten there if it were up to me to do bicep curls with some stupid Thera bands   Just trying to help prepare meals would wipe me out Until it didn t What I m trying to say is that there will probably be lots of opportunities to continue strengthening and skill building not counting what they ll be having you do in outpatient visits Also ask your team about where the adaptive swimming pools that you d be able to use Plan on hooking up with the local SCI support groups near you Don t shrug this one off before you ve given it plenty of opportunities to help you  At my very first meeting I saw a graphic reason why people with nerve disorders shouldn t use electric blankets or aftermarket seat heaters massage chair things No one warned us about that while we were in the hospital It s not their job to teach you common sense They try but just can t warn you of every pitfall heading your way     Write down all your thoughts so you don t forget to bring them up before you leave the safe cocoon of the hospital  Sorry if I m rambling Two weeks is a short time but you ll be surprised how much of a difference it can make in inpatient rehab Good luck transitioning home  You re going through big changes right now and it is okay to be scared Talk to your therapists about your concerns about going home Regarding toileting has your OT tried teaching you strategies for wiping and getting pants down while seated Without know your individual case it seems like an option worth exploring  Thanks for your comments Hubby reassures me that they can handle it even if they have to lift my chair up the steps I have a family training session tomorrow so I m going to bring up more of my concerns to my ot  Would a bidet help with the wiping We have one on the pricier side that has adjustable pressure and aim warm water and a blow dryer We rent and we were able to install it no problem on our toilet It does require electricity but does not require hot water plumbing It has a remote and the seat itself is just like a normal seat except a little taller  We tried but I found it so difficult with a diaper on I m praying I can regain enough strength in the next week to not be embarrassed I m

couple of notes    not all of the drop down answers are fully visible on mobile   some of the answers said  select all that apply  but I was only able to select one   for the b b management section there wasn t an option for including Peristeen Quofora IryPump etc These type of systems have _significantly_ changed my quality of life and outlook on my care so it might be worth having a look at that and updating that section with more options   I included my email address in the survey so I m happy to be contacted about any of the above especially the last point if there are any questions Thanks  Thank you so much for taking the time to do the survey and for this feedback We really appreicate it I ll let Dr Berndl know If you could also pass this survey on to other people you know who might be interested that would be very helpful We ll likely be in touch   The Spread of COVID 19   SCII am a researcher at a neuroscience research facility called the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis

great thanks for sharing  I m pretty sure I have a UTI Is the best course of action to get antibiotics or would that compromise my immune system further to the virus  Thanks so very much for this I ve been through a lot in the 40 years since my injury and I have to say that COVID 19 worries me the most  As a researcher could you share any information regarding SCI and immune response Assuming one doesn t have any underlying issues such as a UTI do SCI patients have  weaker  immune systems I m not a practitioner  MD DO PA PT etc  and therefore cannot give medical advice Your best bet is to speak to a medical professional preferably via telehealth In the meantime the Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems has a factsheet on   Urinary Tract Infection and Spinal Cord Injury  https   msktc org sci factsheets urinary tract infection   I cannot say I have the breadth of your experience but I too think that COVID 19 has serious implications for persons with SCI Especially due to the respiratory targets of the SARS CoV 2 virus that causes COVID 19 disease C6 Quad Intro YoutubeI m subscriber number woot Buddy you need a lapel mic   Also do you know about Cole   Charisma s channel    https   www youtube com channel UCA5Zfb OOm7eDHHa8iu9izQ Ayyy Thanks so much man I m still trying to work my audio out I know it doesn t sound the best    Yes I subscribe and watch them Their content is awesome Do you have a channel I have found it pretty therapeutic to create one Pushes me to try new thingsToday I walked C1 C2 incomplete and walking Welcome to the club You now have to keep going Every Single Day   Every day go just a little bit further The sooner you keep at it the better You will be exhausted but it will be worth it  Congrats    I m at my desk at work and starting to tear up with excitement for you I remember learning to walk again at 28 It is one of the greatest accomplishments in my life   Keep hammering  As a C5 incomplete this is amazing to see Congratulations  I m not someone who understands this but I m really happy for you Congratulations   Great news mate  So happy for you  Just ensure someone is around when you are walking until you get really stable  Don t take any risk at the moment alone  Good luck and all the best  T6 incomplete  I know how you feel  It s a HUGE deal that only you really understand  How long have you been working on it   June 18 will be 2 years in the chair for me and I ve been fighting it the entire time  I can drag myself around on a walker for 5 to 15 minutes  depending on the spasms and pain levels   Ive gotten a couple steps with a Cain once or twice and like you it felt like everything   Good Job Keep up the fight     Congrats  That s awesome My husband is C5 C6 incomplete so I totally get your excitement I hope your spasms continue to be kind to you   I understand how big of a hurdle that can be  Congratulations  I m a T 6 incomplete at about a year out just praying that I can get to where you are C4 5 walking incomplete since 07 Congrats That s got to feel amazing   I was lucky to have been able to start walking independently 7 months post injury 13 years later and I can walk around almost the whole day if needed Nothing happened overnight but I just wanted to encourage you to keep going  Incredible happy for you Way to go  I m so happy for you  Amazing x great news Sending gratz from Scotland xx Congratulations It must feel so amazing and like a dream come true best wishes for continued recovery Well F  king done nothing else need said       As a complete I am so envious But that aside congrats  Here s to more gains  Man that s awesome  Congrats  I was able to stand up by myself and just stay upright on my two feet after approx 3 months   I ve been working on it ever since Progressing slowly For the last six months or so I ve been seeing a physiotherapist three times a week walking on threadmill in stairs in corridors etc  always with some sort of support be it the physiotherapist or some walking aid   And like you it s my spasms which are the greatest challenge I ve got more than enough strength  I m able to mobilize enough strength to jump off the ground  But the crazy clonus and intense rigidity from my abdomen and legs makes it almost impossible to not just fall with every step unless I use a walker or crutches   So you can imagine the feeling of achievement from walking without any walking aid by myself for a longer distance for the first time  Tarlov CystHey So I have 2 herniated discs and a Tarlov cyst as well I fractured my L4 a few years ago My main symptoms were pain and overtime weakness and numbness Mine is smaller than your SO s  1 1cm  and My surgeon at Hopkins agrees that it s not time for surgery yet We are not sure what s causing what as well sadly  Treatment for EDC7 C8 complete for 11 years I ve tried the pills with little to no response so I tried Trimix injections they work great but are about  170 bucks for about 30 injections  Honestly in the end I cant feel it anyway so I worked on my oral game and bought her some new toys been happily married for about 9 yrs now   27 C2 C5 6 incomplete and I ve not been dealing with my injury as long as you but I deal with ED It s different for everyone but I ve never had it solved   I just found ways to defuse a lot of the awkwardness around it and past the first few months it really stopped being an issue for me in terms of actual impact   It was still a thing but I just learnt to perform in other ways and honestly if you re open with it I ve found that mostly it s not too much of an issue   There are also vaccum constriction devices and stuff but honestly I ve never felt it necessary  Would you consider a penis implant  I tried everything and finally discovered them and found a surgeon  I was terrified and kept canceling the operation at the last minute  Finally he called me up and we talked for about 15 minutes and he basically said  look your 40 years old and from here on out if you were completely healthy you d still be gradually losing your erection I ve done many thousands of these and not a single patient regretted it     He was right It s fucking amazing and every woman I ve been with has LOVED it    I did an AMA  with pictures  a few years ago so you can look through my post history for it  27 S2 S4 incomplete Been just over a year and honestly I don t even think about stuff like that anymore or have any urges plus I have zero feeling in the whole region along with complete urethra distraction to boot I m married almost 4 years now and we used to be very active before my accident and now we obviously aren t but it hasn t really affected our relationship We don t do other things and I don t have the ability to get a reflex erection anymore  I don t know if you ve tried it or are able to get it on prescription but Vardenafil  Levitra  works very well for me when Sildenafil  Viagra  basically did nothing I don t precisely know your situation but if you haven t tried this before just reply asking me to elaborate and I will  C5 incomplete here that uses Viagra It s incredible  I am a T11 L3 income and older than you but I have had the same issues I am only a year out and it weighs on me tremendously Yes my oral and otherwise game is on point but there is some part of me that really misses regular intercourse  Majority of SCI patients have low testosterone Ask to be tested Once I was on testosterone for a few weeks I began having morning erections Then reflex erections followed so it s much more manageable when you want to have sex  It also improves libido  energy  depression so might be worth a try If you add Cialis to the equation your sure to get erections  if you have a high injury  rather than an L injury  ED medication  of SOME type  is likely to work Get your doc to give you some viagra cialis etc samples to  start    I would think your GP can probably give you the meds probably don t even need to involve the urologist yet Only caveat is that those meds are expensive and rarely covered under health plans   Without even trying any meds it s far too early to give up Good luck my man    22m  c 5 high functioning quad I m coming up on 2 years since my injury and have dealt with this as well I get my prescription at Costco and its 35 bucks for 30 pills No insurance needed which is a steal compared to CVS who wanted to charge 250 for 30 pills I would talk to other doctors for more options as well   deleted For me my trimix is 80  and lasts longer than the needles they send with it But it changed my sex game tremendously Went from being able to keep an erection for 5min to 2 hrs lol And yes see a urologist having to cath you should be seeing one anywayUrologist say this is by far the best option for ED but nobody wants to do it I def will be checking into it more but trimix works wonders for me T5 complete It took me years to figure all this out After I found trimix and the tens unit to ejaculate I was damn near back to normal as far as a sex life goes Add in the intimate rider and it s even closer to normal See your urologist I wish they taught this stuff in rehab At least they didn t when I when I was there Stuck rear wheelIs it greased up Mine get like that sometimes but it s usually due to needing some grease or WD 40 on the quick release pins

with a very bad foot drop on the right side I wear these boots  https   www colehaan com 2 zerogrand city boot black leather C25557 html  instead of my afo and they provide me with enough support to walk around town with a cane The mix of stability comfort and flexibility of the boot is just the right mix While I would not recommend them for extreme conditions they suit me just fine for moderate wintery conditions and walking about town  You can use a splint that can be hidden inside the shoes   if you will not use splints you must choose a shoes with high neck   They arent light but brahma makes a high top steal toe shoe you can find at walmart Cheap and since u use wheelchair they will last a while They helped my dropfoot quite a lot Do you not wear an AFO  No one recommended you get an afo Ankle foot orthosis my right toe would drag without it  Xtratuf Not in a chair anymore luckily Just walk with a cane and trip a lot now I have one but I hate it Yup they did It just ends up hurting my leg Bless youDisability and Pandemic Disaster PreparednessA few tips here   1 Catheters can be reused Yes seriously After use give it a good rinse with hot water inside and out and then store it in a bottle of rubbing alcohol Shake it off before you use it next time I ve used a single catheter for months on end without a single UTI  2 Meds  talk to your primary doctor now If you get UTIs frequently ask for an Rx for antibiotics to keep on hand Get 90 day supplies of meds I m a primary care physician and have already done this for all of my SCI patients  It s been on my mind for sure I order 90 days worth of catheters at a time and don t reuse but if it came to it you CAN reuse catheters as long as you are extra careful  there s some good YouTube videos that show how to clean sterilize them  I did it for years when I couldn t afford to buy them fresh It s stressful for sure Hang in there  32 C3 C7 incomplete  Same here I have two different nerve pain medications one for spasticity and I m on opioid therapy which is hard enough to get on a good day I panicked last week and attempted to order my medications a little early  less than a week  and was denied due to insurance     I ll send a message to my doctor s office to see if they know what the plan would be I d ask my pharmacy but I m not fully certain they would give me a good answer     I hope you don t have to go without your medications and medical supplies I know how important these are to be able to live some semblance of a life  I just got directed to this FDA website that shows a list of drugs that are experiencing shortages    https   www accessdata fda gov scripts drugshortages default cfm   You can explore estimated availability shortage duration and reasons for the shortage  As the world supply chain starts getting more disrupted this website might start becoming important for people like us  Also how s everyone holding up in general  Hey my husband has catheters that don t work for him He s an L2 incomplete  I m not sure on the number but I think they re 150   the medical company wouldn t let me return them  I need a certain med to stay alive  kind of like a type 1 diabetic needing insulin  so I m definitely thinking a lot about this    I m torn between wanting to order 6 months extra and not wanting to be a hoarder that takes meds away from other people who need it    I m compromising by having 1 month extra meds and checking for med shortages everyday    It s certainly scary times  I ve had a couple of severe UTI s in the past which makes me nervous about reusing them However you re right Desperate times call for desperate needs I ll look at some youtube videos to see what people recommend Hopefully it won t come to that   When was the last time you had to reuse catheters  Yeah I can t imagine what that must be like I once heard about a woman who had a heart transplant and needed these very expensive meds to make sure her body didn t reject it She could only get them in 1 week amounts She got the meds through fedex A hurricane came through and stopped the delivery of her meds for a few days I think she eneded up making it by going to a ER but still That s a whole different level of stress   I m sorry you re going through it I m sure the temptation is there to buy a 6 month supply especially if you have the financial means to buy it I guess that s kind of a moral quandary  Do you buy an extra supply or do you buy a normal supply so that others aren t affected by it   What s your thinking on this  The us system is fucked The Second World War brought the nhs and welfare state I hope the us catches up after this wake up  It makes me sad listening to ppl stress about meds and pisssticks  We drew one of the shortest straws in the most affluent advanced civilisation on earth and America can t pay for piss sticks for the crippled It is criminal  Stay clean stay safe That s awesome to know Can you keep storing it in the same bottle of alcohol The alcohol won t get exhausted quickly   And thank you I did reach out to my GP about my hyprex Right I ve been through something similar before when I had lost my medication My insurance wouldn t budge though and I ended up having to pay an absurd out of pocket pricetag for a week s supply until it could be filled My insurance only covers 30day supplies of my meds which I think is a bit absurd What would happen if the scenario gets more extreme People should be able to get an extra month s supply of medicine in times like these Insurance makes it nearly impossible to stockpile any kind of meds for emergency situations   I called my catheter company the other day to see if they had any sort of protocol for the pandemic and they don t They told me to wait until the end of may when I can order again I keep hoping that deliveries will still be available then Thank you for sending this very important resource I checked it and amy medicine is luckily not in a shortage right now But who knows how long that will last for I will be sure to check up on it weekly Thjs whole thing has been quite stressful That sucks Insurance companies don t give a rats ass about people I m surprised that the medical supply company wouldn t accept returns I once had to return a whole supply because they were the wrong gage I noticed that you are replying to your own post and not to the

experience with orgasm  I ve been dying to know if others have the same I m a c5 and started trying with a hitachi massager about a half year to a year post injury and had a similar situation to you where finally something sticky came out and I felt a release as good as a pre injury orgasm my legs went ballistic but I wouldn t spasm after masturbating Nowadays I can get off with just my hand but use more handheld vibrators mainly pressed on like the taint to get off faster or go for a second or third or fourth time hahah as I ve started to gain back the ability to control my core and be more in touch with like my bowels it really helps to flex my abs and imagine like the connection between the brain spine and prostate or just like taint butthole There was a period where jerking off would then cause my bowels to be loose and like any vibration to allow stuff to leak out like my alternating air mattress or bumpy car ride but I ve gained back that control I m coming up on being two years post injury this summer  How long does it take you  I m seven months in and still have yet to figure my niche out but a lot of these responses are giving me hope  What s your injury level  Definitely sounds familiar  that huge rush of endorphins post climax and the crazy legs dance  I know I m not the only quad out there that does that just to calm down the spasms for awhile  So I m really funny talking about sex but I kinda experienced something a little similar So it takes me forever and a day to come as well but 1 time when I managed to get an ejaculation my toes jump out of this world  it s funny to me when the doctors ask me to move my toes or feet and all you get is the act of them moving but that ejaculation did wonders on my toes well just the left foot and mainly the big toe but I was floored  lol Mine don t feel as good as I remember them feeling tbh But I get super spastic for a minute and then my muscles are super loose for awhile so I ll take it I sleep a lot better afterwards lol Welcome to the club At T 6 you just make the unfortunate cut off above injury levels which generally require medical help to ejaculate I am T 5 6 and first ejaculation was three years post injury with a law school girlfriend  I too experience the spasms If you can maintain your erection long enough you have a good chance of being able to ejaculate during sex I use the Tri Mix Papavirine injection I fathered 5 children that way You do need to watch the Dysreflexia and blood pressure fluctuations but for the most part it s a great feeling both mental and physical We are lucky  I think it s cool it helps spasms gives me a good reason to keep trying at least Yup basically the same thing that happens to me My legs go crazy when I cum I even nailed my wife in the head once with my knee as I usually cum in her mouth My legs lose all muscle tone in them for an hour or two afterwards It s annoying because I use the tone for balance And getting my pants back on But totally worth it  T5 complete here was never able to ejaculate with manual stimulation But I never went super crazy trying either And never tried it with the trimix injections that I now use either Instead I found the Miracle machine that is a tens unit with the attachments for electro sex I now use this regularly meaning couple times a week As with most of the things talked about it seems it begins not to work if used to often For anyone wondering there is a whole thread on it here https   www carecure net forum sci community forums relationships sexuality 128849 electro nut busting You do need to creat an account to view the relationship sexuality thread FYI   As of for how my orgasm feels I feel immediate relief I feel Legs spasm like mad and then go dead I m thinking if I quit using this for like a month I may be able to rub one out But this is super reliable if used once or twice a week Works Flaccid even  Just for something for you guys to try Try coming in your standing it s fucking amazing for me And just cuz I ve never been shy and warning this is very NSFW  Here it is in action   https   www pornhub com view_video php viewkey ph5e48d9dfa550e 1  No idea if that gets me in trouble on here lol  It kind of varies A handful of years ago a cougar I used to mess around with gave a hitachi and that was the big game changer With that it only takes me a minute it s or so Unfortunately it doesn t work every time Recently I have t been able to for like a week or so I can t tell if it s a medication thing or not  too much baclofen or something Keep at it You re at the same level as me Do yourself a favor and get a hitachi magic wand That is a game changer I m a T 6 para So glad to hear that others have the same experience May I respectfully ask for some insight I ll start off by saying I don t really get offended by anything so I m not the best one to ask I m permanently banned from r disability for voicing my apparently unflattering opinion that too many people in the disabled community have a stick up their ass   That said I find the premise a tad cliche and boring It depends on the circumstances I mean what is it that the villain is requesting the protagonist to do in exchange I consider myself a rather moral and upstanding  ha   person I m paralyzed from the chest down and use a wheelchair full time I have for 21 years I have a beautiful wife a child good job I m happy So if his injury is not the focus of the protagonist s life he s probably doing ok With that being the case if what this villain wants him to do is morally questionable if he s anything like me he d just nope the fuck out Having legs that work would be great but not great enough to do some shady shit Also wasn t that the basic drive for the main character in Avatar You infiltrate the indigenous aliens and I ll get your legs working again Just doesn t seem like a good enough incentive for how you described the character They d have to hate their life more  Having him overcome his challenge by adapting to it and growing as a person would be better   Spinal cord injuries are not solved by taking medication So I agree with you they presumably don t mirror your own issues Permanent disabilities have a tendency to affect a person at their core They can be a very important part of a person s identity This is not always a bad thing  in fact I know loads of people with disabilities myself included who cherish that part of their identity   Check out Aaron Fotheringham s instagram He s a WCMX rider   notice how he hashtags  thankyouspinabifida His disability has propelled him into a career that he loves He wouldn t have had that chance if he were able bodied   Obviously permanent injuries and disabilities are devastating and frustrating But it s also a played out trope in media and stories to erase them with the  robotic leg gift   It s been done it s kind of boring and in some ways erases the realities of wheelchair users   You can of course write any story and any book you would like to I d personally find this an aggravating storyline from my perspective as a wheelchair user  I get a little bummed out when I watch or read science fiction and they haven t discovered a cure for SCI  Been in a chair for twenty years and I echo the others sentiments that a cure is not the be and end all Walking is over rated and you able bodied people tend to rate it very highly and wonder why I don t give a shit The wheels are my life they are part of me They don t define me but they make up who I am Removing them would remove part of me and that is not something to be taken lightly and definitely not something I would do shady shit for   I don t find it disrespectful but I do find it a little shallow There is far deeper meaning to he found in disability than the hope for a cure Yeah I just find it kind of boring I ve been dealing with my injury for no where near as long as some of the other folks here but even in the few years I ve had it and been a wheelchair user it s pretty much changed how I view the world and myself   Tbh I ve been asked a lot about cures and stuff because my friends are into scifi and ppl might hate me for saying this but I d prefer the world was more accessible   ppl weren t assholes Obvs there are issues and it s not desirable to have an SCI but I m not sure if I d take bionics over my wheelchair and my SCI   It seems way more interesting to have a nuanced character response to SCI rather than a magic cure imo I also have disorders I take meds for but taking meds for say   my pain or anxiety or whatever is not at all comparable to radically altering your life with the ability to walk again and some ppl  like me  wouldn t even really want that so it s pretty boring and kind of annoying to read a surface level understanding of the psychology of SCI that falls into the same tropes as every other portrayal   deleted  Personally I ve had a unique experience with my own legs My injury was much longer ago than for most SCI patients so I have issues with osteoporosis that I m constantly mindful of I have fractured my legs in one way or another my entire fucking life so they ve been nothing but an annoyance to me Frankly I d personally be okay cutting them off at the knees  where most of my swelling and circulation issues are  and leaving it at that   All that being said I don t think I d give much of a crap being offered the chance to walk again   Maybe a super chair that can navigate any inconvenience wheelchair users face while still being super lightweight That would be neat   I d much rather have full control of my plumbing and the ability to fit into a tiny bathroom stall to go if I needed without anyone s help   I d rather have full sensation back so  getting there  doesn t take an age and a half because my sensation down there isn t  gone  but also fairly reduced   Then again this year marks 27 years for me My view may be skewed by the fact that this is basically all I ve ever known since I was 7 Maybe fresher injuries or worse injuries would jump at the chance I just don t know Everyone is different Last year I discovered in therapy that I still hold on to quite a bit of rage and deep grief regarding my disability than I ever figured I felt Your character s inner world could well be more interesting and relatable to the wheelchair bound than the  here you get your legs back  aspect that doesn t even ring that relevant to me  This guy and I sound very similar including the age of our injury our family makeup and everything I haven t been banned from that subreddit but I will agree with the sentiment My criticism of your premise comes in that legs don t matter unless like the previous poster said they can do some pretty amazing things   If you want to shake things up maybe provide a cure for basic mobilty that already involves some incredible prosthesis but don t fail to address the more challenging parts of a spinal cord injury plumbing issues Those are my two cents Keep us posted if your work makes it for public viewing and thanks for asking Shows that you want your work to be top notch   Also wasn t that the basic drive for the main character in Avatar You infiltrate the indigenous aliens and I ll get your legs working again Just doesn t seem like a good enough incentive for how you described the character They d have to hate their life more   It s a YA novel so the protag is working for the bad guy He thinks he s making a project to win at an inventors competition reality is that he s developing a world controlling technology When he finds out he s going on the run because the bad guys erase people for a living and now he s put a target on his back   You make a good point about Avatar   I don t remember too much negative feedback about that part of the story Is it a trope Sure but so was the entire movie Still made bank at the box office   Also wasn t that the basic drive for the main character in Avatar    Boredom Nothing else  like relatives  keeping him on Earth Curiosity Exaggerated sense of duty Performing one last service for his dead brother The urge to be useful Money    The  definite  offer to get the SCI fixed came after taking a multi year interstellar trip I don t think that s what motivated him to take that trip in the first place I happen to agree with your unflattering opinion for what it s worth Watch me get banned from a subreddit where I ve never even commented    You can of course write any story and any book you would like to I d personally find this an aggravating storyline from my perspective as a wheelchair user   And that s why I m asking   if the entire storyline would be aggravating then I wouldn t want to pursue it I m not here to demand my readers like what I write about So there s no way to handle it just chuck it entirely in your opinion Fair point  I don t find it disrespectful but I do find it a little shallow There is far deeper meaning to he found in disability than the hope for a cure  That s an interesting insight  thank you for sharing that May I ask   is that how you d feel if you were fifteen or so The protag is a teenager   so I m wondering how that might alter his perspective So real talk  would it simply be better for me to drop the idea entirely since it would come across as boring  Thanks for that I m leaning toward just letting the whole thing go and focus on another way to tell the story It s not worth upsetting people  Thanks for that I m leaning toward just letting the whole thing go and focus on another way to

https   www amazon com dp B002OOWB3O ref cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_voMFEb1837058  for everything on my computer I use photoshop for fun from time to time and the ball works really well but it can take a while when I have to drag or trace something as I have to use both this and my laptop s trackpad For simply moving the cursor it works great though so if you have another way of clicking it may be pretty useful  What kind of things take longer   You can record actions on Photoshop and automate sequences of tasks   Also Dragon naturally speaking might be more precise than what you use now  I use  Natural Point  https   www naturalpoint com smartnav   navigation which allows me to place a sticker on a hat or glasses and an infrared light follows my head motion To click I dwell on something I don t like the idea of using something where I have to put the clicking system in my mouth because we all know how things that touch your mouth for long periods of time get I use Dragon Professional I dual run NatPoint and Dragon Thanks for the tips on Photoshop Tips tricks and adaptive equipment from a C5 C6 complete chick    This is great May be helpful to consider cross posting to r occupationaltherapy as we are always on the lookout for new tips and tricks Thank you so much for sharing  Great tools and information Thank you for sharing  Tip  make sure your head is elevated above your camelbak especially in bed and especially for those folks who can t physically move away from the straw  Thank you for posting this Just shared with some fellow OTs    If you can flex your wrist I recommend the  Cripper  reacher An OT wound need to do the measurements to fit it but it s been invaluable for me   I also use hemostats all over the house and keep one in my bag They are like tweezers that lock closed  They re sometimes called Kelly clamps  Very comprehensive list Didn t know many of these things existed Thanks for taking the time to post this to other SCI folk    Another C5 complete here This is so similar to my list As I kept reading down I was hoping to see something that I don t use Unfortunately we have the exact same list I d love to discuss more about what you use your echo for PM me if interested Thanks  Yes  Been a paraplegic for almost 5 years now Where were you and this post 4 years ago   Do you have other examples of  smart  products you use regularly  Ahhhh ok Sorry it was so recent i was still recovering from my car accident then Im 25 now but i still feel like im adjusting every day  My fine motor skills with my fingers and hands have always been troubling for me They have movement hust no complete movement so eating with a fork and spoon as well as typing have always been a little difficult for me Ive used a talking device for typing and have tried to find good utensils for eating so that adaptive fork would be super useful for me  Yes I really appreciate these posts because it helps me collect ideas for my patients with real world reviewsSeconded Oh sure Good point The one I listed has a rubber stopper that stops the flow when you stop drinking  you have to bite down with your teeth to get a drink so it doesn t really spell anywhere but that s still a good tip    This Is Amazing I had no idea something like the cripper existed practically my wildest dreams come true I will definitely look into getting fitted for one Thank you so much for sharing lol I ve only been a quad for a year now so I was still oblivious and walking around back then I m glad you found it helpful Sorry this reply is so late I use the lightbulbs the plugs and the TV that I listed above That s about it Oh I also have a fan that I can control through my phone but the last time we looked for it to buy another one the Amazon provider had stopped selling it What about you Risks with starting to stand again Ok first I need to say PLEASE don t worry If your doctor is confident this is what you should do you should trust them And a standing frame won t take you to full standing in the first session You ll start slowly until you can handle being back at that angle up uprightness   Second it can never hurt to ask your doctor to double check where your bone density is at right now They can do a full 3D scan  advisable every so often anyway  and confirm to you that your legs are up for the body weight   If you trust your doctor then statistically you have nothing to worry about   You could pass out  Your circulatory system is not used to having to pump blood all the way up your full height  So your blood could pool down to your lower body i e leave your brain causing you to get lightheaded and possibly pass out  Wearing an abdominal binder could help mitigate this  You should start small with the standing frame only ten minutes or so the first few days then increasing ten minutes every few days after that  It would be best to have someone there the first week really so if you start to pass out you wouldn t be alone and they could help you get back into your chair pronto and you wouldn t be at risk of falling   For me my signs of imminent passing out  pre lightheaded ness  are muscles weakness sudden fatigue and hot flashes YMMV    Weakened bones possibility of breaks  I ve been injured 20 years and broke my ankle just last year while I was in my standing frame  I leaned far over to one side then straightened back up rolling my ankle in the process and it just snapped  Do you know the state of your bones  When was the last time you got a bone density scan  If it s been more than a few years you ll want to go to your doc and get one before you do any standing  If you also don t do anything to keep your bones strong i e take calcium do range of motion  you definitely should get a bone scan first  My biggest issue when I first started standing was my Blood Pressure wasn t being regulated well enough so I had to be really vigilant with monitoring it But I agree with the other guy and if your doctor gives the OK go for it  Good for you Standing is good for you for me helps with spasms so much Other than passing out I don t know iod any Ted socks and abdominal binder will help Other than that maybe just try to have someone there with ya  Today was my 19th anniversaryI remember someone    John Hockenberry I think the paraplegic reporter    talking about his anniversary the one when his life was half without injury half with  He called it his  hinge point  iirc  I often wonder how I m going to feel with I reach then surpass my own hinge point  When I think about it it feels like I m going to have some sort of identity flip you know  Or maybe I won t maybe that s just anxiety talking   However I end up feeling I m kind of stunned that I ve made it this far  20 years this year   Congrats to you too  Happy celebration of life In April it will be four years for me since the date of my injury It s interesting the way I look at life I m so very thankful for all that I have I have a wonderful life Of course it s not the same I am very fortunate for my family my friends in the healthcare team that helps keep me going Thank you for sharing a little bit of your story with us It s added encouragement to press on word and upward I hope to live a long life and be able to see that point where half my life is post injury The first year post injury I would worry that my life will be shorter because of the injury Now I just live my life one day at a time Living it to the fullest Many blessings to you my friend  You are right  Every year is another gift I passed my 39th anniversary on November 17th of last year   Keep on truckin   I m 27 and a C2 quadriplegic I don t want to die This is a scary time for everyone but I can t imagine what it s like to be in your position I give you so much credit for having the strength to talk about your fears so openly I can t do much for ya but I d be happy to listen or just bullshit for distraction Feel free to DM me  C1 and on a ventilator all I have been doing is staying in my room I haven t left I keep everything pretty clean and much like everyone is saying just watch who you keep around you try to avoid going out I know all of my appointments got canceled Usually I troll people for whining but to you I truly am sorry and feel free to continue to reach out because what you described does sound completely bat shit scary Holler It s a scary time for all of us I fractured C2 C3 and C4 I am very grateful to not be on a ventilator In addition I am an incomplete quad That brings a whole host of different issues I m also a nurse It s very important that you isolate yourself and ensure that anyone that comes in contact with you is washing their hands If they have any signs of illness ask them not to visit If necessary have them wear a face mask Facemasks other than N95 masks or not full proof They will help prevent respiratory droplets from their mouth being spread into your space Hang in there Try not to listen to the news This is very serious but listening to the news will get you more worried about it than you need to be If you need to talk please continue to post here Don t hesitate to DM me Happy to chat with you Sending positive vibes your way  Ughh So frightening But I was actually joking about this with someone yesterday God forbid you get infected and get sick enough with COVID 19 that you have to go to the hospital at least you can BYOV  bring your own ventilator  But seriously I hope you stay healthy and avoid infection and that everyone you re in physical contact with has your safety top of mind and is limiting their risks as much as possible too  I feel ya man You know to voice your concern to all your caregiver s  Are they quarantine as well  I m not on vent but I ve got some breathing issues from my incomplete C2  also 27 btw  and ngl this did cross my mind  I feel you man I haven t been able to sleep in days because of the stress  C5 6 years  The one thing that we cripples are good at is A been isolated from the general population and B understanding that time runs differently for us For example 6 months to a year of maybe not doing so much really isn t that much of a sacrifice considering sometimes we really aren t doing very much  I never go on that fucking tube anyway  If you are prepared to be isolated from the general public Don t make any stupid quarantine breaking decisions with your friends and family You will be fine If you re smart and you keep ahead of it you will be fine Keep yourself clean keep yourself out of hospital   It s going to go through the general population in about six To 12 months Once that has happened and enough people have had it and recovered from it will become less and less transmutable through the population Hopefully by which time there may be a vaccine But until then we cannot be too careful My doctor friend said to me  absolutely no contact with the virus for you  Make no mistake this is a serious disease and it does affect anybody with young people and it s indiscriminate as to who it takes The only appropriate action for us is to avoid and wait out the storm My life got put on hold six years ago I m not about to let some fucking bug take the rest of it  I m happy to sacrifice six months or a year to let this thing blow over You should all think about doing the same Good to know I m not the only one here ready to dropkick anybody who is sick that comes across to me  How did u become paralyzed  How are you now OP  Yeah thanks for empathizing Good luck with your quarantine Thanks for understanding If I didn t have the ventilator I wouldn t be so scared but I don t have any idea how bad things could get You say if necessary have them wear a face mask what would make it necessary or not Would that default to everyone wears a mask Hey thanks for replying and good luck Haha alright I like your perspective I can outlast this shit It was a car accident ten years ago Eh okay Still paralyzed so no change there haha but coronavirus is still something hard to get out of my mind FES C5 complete here I went to Craig Hospital after my accident in a wave Four years ago I used FES bike while I was there and it help me gain a lot of muscle back No function just muscle It also got my endorphins up which was something I wasn t used to I now live out of Colorado and it s difficult to find a FES bike I wish I knew a better way  Yo Been doing FES since my injury and it seeeeems like it s helping regain some control function in my weaker  right  side I am only able to do it 1 2 week but I think it helped significantly over the past couple of months I m about 7 months into my injury  incomplete  and have a lot of function in my left side but my right side has been lagging significantly and the spasms are beginning to get really bad which can affect my FES pretty negatively PT here  I ve used it with patients a bunch and find it beneficial I ve seen it improve function for some and reduce atrophy with others I highly recommend it  I used it on some weak wrist muscles at the beginning of my injury and it has allowed me to regain wrist extension however as far as I understand it it just strengthen those muscles so I could use them again  I am working on an open source machine for FES It senses your movements and you can teach it repetitive movements and when to activate specific muscles during this movement  4 channels    I personally have a progressive condition and I use it to fight back so I can continue doing all the things I used to do  such as running  I still sprint at 25 km h   The aim here is to enable fun training that would otherwise be impossible I was thinking others could have great training with this   Components for the current version was ordered from Amazon  150   and assembled in an evening I am a computer programmer and the majority of the work has been related to the program responsible for learning how to translate movement into muscle activation   Sounds interesting  This company makes a more affordable one www myolyn comDo you own an FES bike We are a team of neurosurgeons and APPs from Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Hospital working during COVID 19 crisis AMA A friend has just been injuredIf you have flu covid do not visit  she may have difficulty breathing on her own and be on a ventilator or have a tracheotomy so you visiting might place her at danger   Neck injuries are difficult to assess but if she can move her arms and legs it means it s an incomplete injury which means she still has connection from her brain to her spinal cord and that s great news She ll have a chance to do physical therapy and maybe her condition can improve   Other than that there s nothing I or anyone can tell you since each injury is different Just keep being her friend and visit when you are healthy or call PM me if you have specific questions  It sounds like she may have central cord syndrome I applaud your choice to put her health and safety first  If it just happened Monday she may still have spinal shock In the early weeks after a spinal cord injury the body is responding to the initial trauma It will take some time to know what impact then injury had The doctors should be able to provide more information based on MRIs and clinical assessments   If you are not well whether it is COVID 19 or just a cold then you are doing the smart and kind thing to stay away Reach out by phone voice chat etc but it is best not to expose your friend to contagions    Best luck to her  Sending good vibes to you and your friend Thanks  She s breathing and talking on her own so that s a good sign  I m not going anywhere near her though until I m 100  in the clear and even then I ll be masking up  That is going to be a while so I m hoping to get someone to set up a video chat so I can talk to her   Thanks again  I just feel so awful being stuck away from her and unable to even talk to her    I have CCS and yes it sounds likely to be it When I was first injured I could lift my legs pretty easily lift my arms with great difficulty and my hands didn t work at all   If it is CCS then it has one of the best prognoses of any spinal cord injury After a few weeks when spinal shock goes away she will have a better idea as to the extent of the injury After that it is possible to see significant recovery in the first 1 2 years but it depends how bad the initial injury is I agree it sounds like central cord syndrome There was a man at my rehab when I was there that could walk around fine but his arms were completely paralyzed Sexual NeedsI feel your frustration I m a C3 incomplete quad I can get erect but cannot get off for anything What does happen is weird nerve sensations and bilateral leg spasms with each stroke For the past 4 years I ve been fortunate to have some physical intimacy  making out and cuddling I can count on one hand the number of ejaculations that I ve had The effort to get to them causes my body spasticity to go crazy and therefore not worth it I ve always been a very sexual person Masterbating was a 2 or 3 times a day thing and then sex almost daily I choose to meditate now I choose transendental meditation twice a day for 20 minutes It helps alleviate some of the anxiety and sadness I feel over the loss of sex It also helps me to tolerate my pain better It doesn t take it away the weird and ever unpredictable pain that the SCI causes but it helps me manage the pain better  I m female Ways I ve found that you might want to explore would be nipple play and mental masturbation  The first takes exploration the second takes patience and practice  With either you won t get that  explosion  feeling like you d get pre injury but you can get some pretty good feelings going on  Mental masturbation involves creating intensely detailed fantasies in your head  personally I find that writing erotica helps with this  It can get pretty hot   Some guys swear by prostate stimulation perhaps someone here can tell you about that better than I   I m almost 4 months post injury  c7  and I can t feel anything the couple of times I ve had sex with my husband I ve tried a vibrator and no luck  I was paralyzed totally from the chest down but I m slowly getting more sensation in my chest like it s going downwards I m hoping eventually I ll regain sensation in the clit area   I m with you man I m 7 months in and just getting to the point where I m just gonna give up Have tried  P Spot  simulation but haven t worked out the kinks yet so no go yet  I m glad someone mentioned the mental pleasuring because it s always hard to really explain how I get off   and everything that was mentioned is very true for me Visual aid helps with the imagination as well Good luck Most dudes I know end up going to a sex worker  Ok so I just copy pasted my comments from the thread above I had no luck until this Noticed some ladies in this thread I have absolutely no idea if this will work  I do know I ve seen able bodied women use the pads on themselves   T5 complete here was never able to ejaculate with manual stimulation But I never went super crazy trying either And never tried it with the trimix injections that I now use either Instead I found the Miracle machine that is a tens unit with the attachments for electro sex I now use this regularly meaning couple times a week As with most of the things talked about it seems it begins not to work if used to often For anyone wondering there is a whole thread on it here https   www carecure net forum sci community forums relationships sexuality 128849 electro nut busting You do need to creat an account to view the relationship sexuality thread FYI   As of for how my orgasm feels I feel immediate relief I feel Legs spasm like mad and then go dead I m thinking if I quit using this for like a month I may be able to rub one out But this is super reliable if used once or twice a week Works Flaccid even  Just for something for you guys to try Try coming in your standing it s fucking amazing for me And just cuz I ve never been shy and warning this is very NSFW  Here it is in action   https   www pornhub com view_video php viewkey ph5e48d9dfa550e 1  No idea if that gets me in trouble on here lol  This sounds a bit like my situation Can you feel any pleasure in your penis at all or at least tell what your body thinks feels good If so I may have some advice As I said in a previous comment it took me 10 years but I found a fairly reliable way to cum I ve never heard of mental masturbation Where did you learn about it Any tips     I ll take anything at this point Have you ever published any of your writings I sure hope it works out for you soon You deserve to enjoy thatKeep trying new things It took me almost 10 years before I learned how to get off I now cum at least once a week Multiple times a week depending on the situation My wife and I fucked every day multiple times a day for the first 3  years we were together Then we decided to have a kid Between her job my job and the toddler we don t get the chance as often as we used to My wife is pretty good at making sure I at least get to cum once a week We might have sex more often than that It s just that I only cum about as third as often as we have sex What do sex workers know then we don t The Coronavirus and spinal cord injuryThanks there s some great info in here Thank you for sharing this  I just found my old incentive spirometer and have been chugging away   Thanks for the excellent post   Breathe on fellow citizens  Wow thanks Are quadriplegics considered immunocompromised I m not sure about our immune system s but I know our breathing is compromised for sure Can t clear your lungs or have trouble too and you have a pneumonia that s a big problem   I would wager that we are higher risk than the general population in comparative age I think every individual with an SCI above T4 should consider himself immunocompromised I study this stuff The research shows that if your autonomic system is affected your immune function is affected Stay safe out there Be careful  My husband is a quad incomplete His doctor said he s not any more susceptible to catching the virus but he is at greater risk of secondary respiratory infections because of decreased mobility and a weaker cough Pneumonia is what s been killing people with this virus My husband got the pneumonia vaccine last year and his doc said that will help if he does catch it  I don t know about being immunocompromised but your cough is a lot weaker and Corona virus has a bat of terrible pneumonia that affects a lot of older   immocompromised individuals So stay safe  This study used a mouse model but I wouldn t be surprised if something similar was true for people as well I consider myself immunocompromised to err on the side of caution    https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 20832407  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 20832407    more at risk if I were to come down with it   Maybe but not due to being immunocompromised  white blood cell counts can be checked for if you are worried about that    I ve had more than one bout of pneumonia and they were all on the   more affected side of my body Maybe because that side of the lung is less ventilated due to scoliosis and lack of muscle strength  My husband is C5 and he s been self isolating for about a week now When anyone comes in we make them wash their hands and I sanitize surfaces  I was told I m not immunocompromised but that my breathing could make things real difficult if I happened to catch it So I m essentially self isolating  https   www christopherreeve org blog life after paralysis the flu Yeah that s what I was figuring I imagine the risk just gets worse for every level you go higher Like a C4 is going to be more at risk than a C6 etcHis doctor is completely wrong about the vaccine helping fight COVID19 The pneumonia vaccines help protect from pneumococcal pneumonia such as Streptococcus Pneumoniae one type of bacteria that causes pneumonia COVID19 is a virus and thus causes viral pneumonia It is not affected or tempered by the pneumonia vaccine I have trouble keeping people off of their phones If you think about it a cell phone is the dirtiest thing we own probably every time someone comes into my house besides just having them wash their hands I also make them Clorox their phone front back and sides stay safe out there Will my back pain go away  para at T11 Asia A not sure if complete or incomplete  If you are ASIA A then you are complete friend    Since everyone is different there is no way to know if your back pain will go away  However anecdotally I can tell you mine did improve There s an adjustment period to sitting in a chair so over time it will settle in Also your body is probably still healing   depending on how recent So all that  to answer your question  probably will get better  T 4 5 ASIA B here Give it time I m 5 years out no idea how long it has been for you and it has become tolerable I have nerve pain and there are no medicines to stop that First 6 months are going to be hell But you ll learn to tolerate it I had a few contusions in my head due to my accident and I d fall asleep relatively faster as soon as I d close my eyes after my injury Also the nerve pain the constant feeling that my foot is on fire and constant prickling sensation I couldn t sleep the first few months I d wake up in the middle of the night and start touching my feet And couldn t sit for extended time in my wheelchair also Half an hour sitting would give me back pain Five years later I work full time now and sit for more than 12 hours That includes 2 3 hours of travel by car It pains sometimes but it s not that much Keep yourself distracted and you ll be good  My SCI occurred from L3 L4 about six years ago Initially I had lower back pain that was helped with pain meds  along with nerve pain in legs that was not helped by pain meds  Once the shock in my body finally calmed down many things started improving including the lower back pain It took about six months for the shock to abate and my doctor told me this was a normal time frame Another improvement from this was that the exhaustion went away and that s when I started feeling much better overall I think I also had to get used to sitting in the wheelchair every day And my body took some time to heal   A friend who has had two SCIs told me something soon after my injury that really helped me get through the first year He said just hang on through the first year and do everything to keep your mood positive After the first year everything will seem tremendously better I held on to this advice and it really helped me to get through the first year Hang in there  T5 complete herr  I got My injury almost exactly a year ago and im still improving pain wise  First six months i could hardly move from searing pain Now i only take pain meds maybe once a week  I m a C3 incomplete quadriplegic The four year anniversary date of the accident is approaching in April I have muscle spasticity and nerve pain from my shoulders down The first year was the worst It does improve My body has adjusted to the pain Most days I don t really pay much attention to it The worst part for me is the nerve and sensation pain It seems as though I go through periods of time where it is really horrible By that I mean my feet will have sensations that feel like they are sitting in a fire pit Then will turn around and feel like they are solid blocks of ice I was maxed out on oral gabapentin and that left me with crazy brain fog I m now on Lyrica 150 mg twice a day For spinal cord injuries you can go up to 300 mg twice a day I find that the 150 twice a day helps me for the most part Unfortunately the answer I get from most of my physicians when something crazy happens or I have increased nerve and sensation pain is that they tell me I have a spinal cord injury There s no method to the madness   Saying everything that I just said I want you to know that it does get better You find ways coping hopefully healthy versus destructive and your body adjusts to its new normal Every one of us on this subreddit group have similarities regardless of our injuries and then we have our own experience of how our bodies react to our individual injuries Hang in there my friend I m not sure where you live but there are wonderful support groups in many areas Some of them will allow you to participate online or by phone In addition this sub seems to be a group that provides wonderful support and information  I m an L1 Asia C injure December of 2018 I have a fussion of T12 L3 I had constant back pain for the first month or so but Tylenol helped stave that off Once I took off my TLSO  back brace  at the 12 week mark I had regular back pain for a few more months I still have a lot of pain some days but most of the time it s fine now I wish you the best if luck with your recovery and adjustment  Thanks   I was just curious if this will be something I just suffer through forever or improvement is ahead I m Asia A and I m incomplete L1 walker and parttime chair user since my last surgery in Nov 19   On the pain issue no one can tell as every injury is different but I know from experience  3 spinal surgeries now  there will be a lot of swelling at the injury site which can take 2 years to subside Don t loose hope just yet there is a lot of healing still to go Thanks for the reply Hopefully it improves   my hardware is still healing so they could be it I forgot to mention that the one thing that really helped me with pain in general and especially with the nerve pain was marijuana and also CBD I m lucky that I live in Colorado where marijuana is legal so I have easy to it Throughout my returns to Craig Hospital in the first three years for re evaluation they told me that many SCI patients told them that marijuana helped much more with pain than the narcotic pain meds For me this was very true In fact it is what helped me to stop using pain meds altogether and I still use it as needed You basically described my injury pain trajectory  C5 incomplete quad  At first when the pain came it s quite overwhelming and upsetting  As others have said time heals both physically and mentally I used to be jacked up on pregabyln Lycra but for the same reasons fucked it off That s not to say it s not necessary for as long as you want to need it  Sure my feet set on fire but honestly 6 years in It s not nearly as bothersome as the genuine panic it stirred up in the beginning  Think of it like a cut or a bruise as kid that first toe stub or bee sting Pain and panic pain and fear  Now think how you react after years and years of stubbing banging tripping poking falling etc   Pain no fear or panic   Although if I bang my toe now least I don t feel it   Trust me mate you ll be fine It does takes time I Stood Just brought tears of joy to my eyes CONGRATS  Congrats  Don t give up  It took me over a year to learn to walk again It was a super hard road You got

Congratulations Keep on keeping on  yayyyy congratulations     C5 Asia d I remember my pt getting me to stand after 3 weeks of lying down and just sitting up would cause orthostatic hypotension aka passing out   My weak side was definitely slumped but standing there unsure if I was even standing on my own But I looked over and my friend was smiling ear to ear giving me a thumbs up and I knew what was happening I stood for about 10 seconds but that memory will be one of the memories that Flash before my eyes before dying   Good job and keep up the hard work It pays off  That is awesome  I think the next time you do this maybe you should set your phone somewhere and record so that you can see yourself doing this Reason being is so that you can look at yourself from another perspective to see how much upper body strength you are using to push down on the walker to assist yourself when standing  State the time and date and the possible percentage the ratio of upper body strength and lower body strength   Then when you look back in a couple of months you will be able to see your improvements and the smile on your face when you view that video will be well worth it Also ask your therapist if she he would state their assessment on video too Splice all the videos together into one   I m very happy for you Keep up the awesome work and please keep us updated      C1 C2 central

becoming quadriplegic  any experience with scholarships or grants I m in Arkansas and the Spinal Cord Commission office in our area was a godsend for just about everything we needed If you have one nearby or something similar they may be able to point you in the right direction    Also tell your daughter apply to every scholarship she possibly can  through the school or otherwise  even if she doesn t meet the qualifications they have listed If no one who meets the qualifications they ll sometimes give the scholarship to the best candidate Some of the smaller scholarships don t get many applicants because it s such a small amount of money but those small scholarships will can add up to a decent amount   She can also apply to be a student worker so she can make a little money to put towards her degree if needed The schedules tend to be more flexible than a regular job and it s great for networking   She may also qualify for Pell Grants depending on your income   I know you wanted your kids to graduate debt free but life throws you curve balls sometimes Try not to beat yourself up too much You sound like a great parent student loans or not  Contact the Christopher Reeves

htmReceiving anal sex   paraplegiaI m female  This is my experience and advice   I m 20 years post  I no longer do anal play  I ve found that my butt just can t take it anymore without consequences those being  loss of sphincter tone  as you mentioned   tissues becoming more delicate resulting in external injury  splitting   increased incontinence    However if you re younger your injury is younger you probably won t have as many issues so I say have fun while you can  Just please be careful and don t use big toys and if your partner is on the bigger side go SLOW and use tons of lube   You say that you will lose tactile sensation with a partner  I don t know if that s always true  with me I often keep a hand fingers down where the action is happening so I know what s going on  plus it s a turn on  so that way you d still be able to feel what s going on    As far as the other stuff  my recommendation is to be very open and honest with your partner about your concerns and about how your body is different than most other bodies  Tell them you need to start go slow  Tell them you d be OK with a faster pace for a minute or two but then you d need them to stop for a minute so you can see how your body is reacting  or however you want to do that   All your concerns are valid and you shouldn t compromise your health or safety just to sexually please anyone else or because you feel uncomfortable talking about it  Regarding autonomic dyslexia    Are you susceptible to it and do you know it when it occurs  It s common that even EMS crews   skilled nursing facilities don t know what it is or have never experienced it firsthand I have  or had  a little credit card sized laminated card explaining what it is why it happens why it s life threatening and first aid procedures for the inexperienced I also have a tube of nitroglycerin paste handy if I can t correct the cause promptly I also make sure each new primary doctor I get is well versed in it in case I need them to back me up in the face of ignorance   Good luck in the butt    I actually just got a so called  P Spot  stimulator but haven t had a chance to try it out yet  I mean it just got here today      I am a little anxious a little worried but pretty excited to see how it goes  It will be my first time ever really exploring back there so I ve been trying to find posts just like these so thank you     x200B   Just trying to enjoy sexual activities again and trying to find any way that works for me  I m about 7 months in from T6 7 Incomplete with a little bit of sensation coming back but I m like a sexually frustrated rhino over here and I m getting crazy impatient with the lack of  release   deleted  Thanks for your input and I will certainly bear that good advice and your experiences in mind in my case it s 34 years post accident I guess it s probably something I can only resolve one way or another by careful experimentation Good tip on retaining some tactile feedback with the hand placement too   Yeah i have a page from a SCI management book I flash to any new doctor  other than the ones at the Spinal Unit  and it s definitely something a lot have not heard of let alone experienced It also seems to scare a bunch of them  the description alone not presentation of any symptoms  Not prone to full on AD though I m always wary of situations that might trigger one Every time it has occurred has been bladder related due to voiding issues resulting in distension Always keep some nitro pills close by or on my person though just in case   Thanks   I m glad it was a timely post for you and hope you have fun with your new toy Certainly for me anal play is the most stimulating sexual activity  below injury level at least  so hopefully it is suitably stimulating for you too Let us know how you get on   Thanks for the advice that s reassuring to hear I ve taken on some pretty big dildos too without any issues and likewise not noticed anything long term regarding tightness but It s just that final step of relinquishing control to someone else that gives me pause I guess   Ladies  crotch chafingHello there I do get chafing as I have plenty of allergies and

try giving yourself a break from underwear and pads At least at night when you can try sleeping commando as this is great for our hoo ha The skin needs to breathe and so does our vag I would also try wearing 100  natural fibre underwear and this is not that easy to find these days Try to find underwear that is either made by cotton or bamboo that allows your skin to breath and hence helps reduce the amount of chafing Maybe also try some pads that are handmade from natural fibers too   There are also period undies that you could try but they are made from man made fibres      https   www

health rashes from pads Something else you may want to consider  the pads that you wear are designed for wicking away moisture    great for when you have leaks but not so great when you have to wear them constantly because they wick away ALL moisture which can leave your vulva in general quite dry  This can lead to the delicate skin cracking or splitting which creates small wounds that can look like cuts   My gynecologist suggested that I use a thin coating of Aquaphor  basically vaseline  on the vulva a couple times a day which will help keep moisture in  Yes a good start I also go commando

exchanges measured over a period of months With only a few of those actually likely to progress to the next stage of meeting in person I think in my  best  year I maybe had four partners from there

these days   for good reason It s a safe place it s a bunch of people at your fingertips Sure it s got its own issues but online dating is so much easier   OkCupid was a good hit for me  I definitely had my share of dates and most of them were fun   Match and EHarmony may be your best bets IMHO These sites really sing if you pay the monthly fee  and you should  Pay sights have an inherent way of

ended up wasting time on people that would have just ignored my profile cause of the chair Weed out the people who aren t cool with it first that way you aren t wasting time  Tinder is very frustrating at times best of luck to you Try https   www dating4disabled com  Or https   www whispers4u com  I found the love of my life on one of them  Honestly the same way you did before your accident A lot of cute girls on Tinder  I only started my account today but I ve been at it an hour and only got two matches  one of them was a dud  I m not a bad looking dude either At least according to some people I ve never tried Bumble has that worked better for you compared to Tinder You must have a really engaging profile I suck at this stuff I would say don t advertise it but also don t intentionally hide it I found my current GF on tinder on my profile I made sure it was clear I was on a wheelchair I had a couple of pics with the chair and a joke about it in the description which turned out to be the reason she texted me And also include pics of you doing  normal  things Like driving a car or cooking or other totally normal independent stuff If someone has never met someone with a SCI there s a huge chance they think you have a nurse full time or that you cant live a normal life  for example What would you recommend I tried these as well It definitely brought a lot of devotees my way  I would like to implore people to keep an open mind when talking with these people but use caution  they are flakes They ghost hard because their kink is  taboo   If you can get one to be reasonable you may just find a dev to be your thing  But if it s not your thing know devs patrol those sites Tobacco   Nerve painYes 100  I quit smoking for a little bit and when I started again my nerve pain became increasingly worse I asked my doctor about it and she said that tobacco could be a cause for the increase in nerve pain  Nicotine is a powerful nerve toxin that damages your nerves Smoking is not worth the extra pain At least not for me  Absolutely  Wish it didn t because I used to enjoy a smoke with a drink every once in a while but not anymore because it sets my nerve pain on fire  Whoa That makes ao much sense Im only a social smoker but it makes a lot of sense that one begat the other  thanks for bringing this up  Having a cigarette seems to make my spasticity increase and nerve pain stronger but only for a few minutes usually I m generally back to normal by the time I finish smoking  It really does it s so weird  Sometime a big bender on the booze at the weekend does the same  Also on a side note smoking is bad for normies really bad for us cripples Don t add additional cripplness I started smoking again when I got out of rehab and my nerve pain has gotten worse so maybe there s something to it They told me it did So I quit smoking They lied But at least I quit smoking  I did not know that I chew tobacco quitting in the processTraveling and No 2T8 complete with history of pressure sores I take a cushioned seat with me to go over the toilet to protect me All the chairs I have been offered travelling have not been suitable Good luck  I pack and travel with a padded raised toilet seat which I fasten to the toilet   Pressure sores are not a problem until they are Then they can wreck your life No one wants to spend months in bed hoping that a wound will close that it won t escalate to osteomyelitis or worse to sepsis One slip and you can hit a hard surface and break down the tissue Go onto  sci rutgers edu  https   sci rutgers edu  and read about how easy it is to start an ulcer A recent study indicates that even small impacts to the skin break it down and make it prone to ulceration   When you are young it s easy to develop habits which are not conducive to long term health For instance you can make awkward transfers with bad positioning of your arms and get away with it Then one day you tear a rotator cuff and suddenly your transfers are much more difficult  and dangerous  If you can initially learn good habits your older self will thank you I speak from experience  40 years in a chair  I was a  supercrip  and did everything to the max I handcycled 15 miles every day 30 miles on Fridays made awkward transfers and  did the impossible   I suffer with aching shoulders which keep me up at night Oh the things I d say to my younger self   Sure you could transfer to a hard seat and trust that your bony prominences were safely out of danger But if you make a mistake the rest of the trip really won t matter that much to you Treat yourself luxuriously  you deserve a padded seat and fewer worries   Oh before I end this tome you can say  manual evacuation of the bowels after digital stimulation  if you want to discuss bowel care with a bit less uh messiness     Good luck and best wishes  I m a T12 complete para and I do just sit on the toilet I have had pressure sores but it wasn t from that When I sit on the toilet my three bony sit bones don t hit the seat its more the area surrounding them I think you ll be ok but being cautious is VERY SMART I would call ahead and see if they offer a commode chair or maybe bring a removable padded toilet seat cover you can strap to the seat Good luck  How long is your bowel program I am a T8 and just use the toilet seat even at home I use Metamucil and enemeez and rarely am on the toilet more than 15 minutes I m T10 complete too I m pretty light so my transfers may be easier than most but I haven t used a commode since the hospital I transfer over and shift as far forward on the seat as I can for  reach back room  I wouldn t personally worry about pressure sores as the pointy bones of my ass sit inside the circumference of the seat I would say like everything else give it a try at home a few times because every injury and every person is a little bit different Maybe it won t work but at least then you ll know  T10 as well I also use a squat a pooty to help give me easier access to the anus  Are people with quadriplegia more vulnerable to the Corona Virus What are your thoughts Yes people don t actually die from the Corona virus but things like pneumonia which you catch because COVAD 19 has weakened your immune system As a quad and not being able to cough pneumonia can be life threatening  I asked my husband s doctor about this She said it s not that he s more vulnerable to contacting the virus but that he s much more susceptible to secondary respiratory infections like pneumonia and that s what makes it deadly He s had the pneumonia vaccine and we ve been super diligent about washing our hands Doc said that we re doing all the right things until more is known about the virus  Using catheters adds an additional entry point of infection  Keep clean and use those wet wipes pre pee  Why should I be more concerned about the coronavirus than pneumonia   I am a C5 complete My cough is weak but I have gotten pneumonia before and it sucked but I didn t die Everyone is making out the coronavirus to be life or death  for quads  but if I have had pneumonia before  it obviously sucked and I was using my cough assist almost every hour  and didn t die why should I be more concerned about the coronavirus than pneumonia  Yes Weakened immune system  Would those cough assist machines be of any use in this situation How is our immune system weakened Borderline personality disorder common in patients with chronic pain 27 5  in SCIYou forgot to post the link    I think it s pretty fucked to diagnose someone with chronic pain with a personality disorder   In fact I d argue that if you had other conditions that are likely to be responsible for your symptoms then you don t exactly have a personality disorder  was your other personality suppose to copy and paste  Oh we know this that s why I moody  A disorder just means it interferes with your life Complications with my medications gave me GERD and Barrett s Esophagus Does that mean I don t have them because it was created by another medical condition Of course not   I can see the symptoms myself with people I interact with There are absolutely times where I am a giant asshole whether it is a bad pain day or tbi causing it doesn t change how it interferes with my relationships Thus it is a disorder     If it doesn t interfere with your life than it is not a disorder Having flare ups makes sense and why they would consider labeling it borderline Has anyone else been in a gray area regarding their sci How did you deal Unfortunately no one can tell you anything because every SCI is different   Your best course of action right now is to work heavily with your physical and occupational therapist You should also talk with a therapist or counselor One month isn t that long and yes there is a grieving process   My husband is a C something incomplete We re about at the two year mark from his injury and things are

itself but because it will impede your ability to do rehab or explore legal options if it turns out that the surgery did go awry  I can relate to your struggle because I am also someone who was paralyzed fully from the waist down and told by doctors I d be in a wheelchair forever but now 6yrs later I walk with a cane I don t want you to give up hope Right now is so scary for you because the

lifesaver for me 3 months post injury and I have no idea what I m doing this helps so much    would love some input to help get this message out  of course I was surprised that no one has done this before I will update this post and I am looking at doing a podcast or something in the future to inform people with spinal cord injury and those withoutAbility to have orgasmSame fam I m a little over one and a half years post accident and those feelings have subsided some but it s still a bitch I am a t8 complete and can somewhat get an erection but I can not orgasm not for lack of trying I feel  see a lot of the muscles spasming when I try but I think the lack of result is possibly medication based Im on several meds but lexapro and baclofen can result in the inability to cum and im on both plus the spinal injury just makes it hard It s a pretty common topic on here and some people have had some success with different approaches if you take a look through other posts you might find something that works    https   www hotoctopuss com diverse accessible sex erection problems   https   www hotoctopuss com diverse accessible sex erection problems   these work like the hitachi but a fair bit cheaper and they ve got better settings This was one of the biggest things that affected me mentally after my injury  T7 complete over 4 years ago  Not being able to walk was obviously first and then this issue And ya know I have never really gotten over it Idk how to Ive been struggling with it ever since Ive been able move on from not being able to play sports but not being able to ever orgasm during sex ugh   Even now I cant get over it Im sorry if this didnt help at all just how I feel about it  I ve been wanting to post about this for a while but I have an issue similar but might be unique   I m going to make a separate post about this for visibility in hopes that it helps someone else out   First  I m an L 1 incomplete able to walk short distances without my cane unable to get an erection and ended up getting a penis implant  HOLY SHIT HIGHLY RECOMMEND and I did an AMA that went viral several years ago Even did several on air phone interviews to TV and radio     I have zero feeling in my penis but I have an area the size of a quarter beside my penis I have complete sensation  my luck of course    When I get aroused I spontaneously  orgasm  and a small amount of semen will flow out barely  couldn t even make out with a girl without climaxing   The orgasm is more like a strange feeling in my head that isn t really pleasant without any body sensation   Here s what fixed it  I was a firefighter paramedic for 20  years  got drug tested OFTEN  and was always very straight laced growing up I NEVER did drugs of ANY kind and was firmly against cannabis  I kept seeing SCI folks recommend weed to me and I was just completely against it  brainwashed    Then my partner said she would try it with me if I would  It was a few sessions before I discovered this but one night I was fairly high and we started messing around  I noticed immediately that I was HIGHLY aroused but I hadn t climaxed yet  Then we had sex and I was able to go and go   But then  I had a MASSIVE orgasm that I FINALLY felt and it was MAGNIFICENT    It gets better  several years later I tried my first psychedelic  We made a mushroom tea and I ll be damned if I wasn t able to have MULTIPLE full body full ejaculatory orgasms    I ve experimented with different psychedelics and have found that with lower doses I m able to explore not only my consciousness but my sexuality as well Higher doses are for going DEEP within yourself and exploring your mind and not much sex goes on with those    I still have zero desire to try drugs that make you escape I prefer psychedelics and use them as tools   I m super curious if anyone else has had similar results and if anyone can explain why this works so well for me  Hi there There are lots of discussions about this on this sub so you are absolutely not alone Others will likely chime in here but I can also tag you on some posts if you d like   Also I don t think less sensation is normal sequelae of disuse Maybe less urge but not less sensation Also some men have issues with low testosterone so definitely get that checked if you haven t already  Also if you haven t and you re ok with it give the Hitachi Magic Wand a try If you have a partner you can also get attachments for it for your partner for extra fun    I m very incomplete t 10 I assume I can t get psychogenic erections it seems and zero nocturnal ones I have a super high sex drive so it s like being a prisoner trapped in my mind After some work and manual stimulation I get 80  erections and my orgasms are about 60  I feel like the nerves that transmit thoughts to my penis are subdued and only after watching porn and manual can I make it work Iv e never had a girlfriend because most guys get aroused and touched then get wood I can t and fear embarrassment I can walk run an do stuff it s just my penile nerves is subdued a bit same as my lower extremities I can feel my feet and my legs just not as sensitive ad say by arm area or neck The worst part is porn abuse nothing really works anymore so i m rebooting right now iv e done this before and it works but the worst part is I will be alone forever and cant date despite people thinking im normal because I walk around and do stuff play sports run etc  I m telling you I went years not having an erection except the occasional randoms that only stayed for a minute or two Then i got EDEX and that changed instantly  you should try to get it brother even without a girlfriend at least you can know that it will work when you finally do find a girl Or you can get a professional to help you out if you have the money You d be surprised how easy it is to get sex drugs approved by insurance  I m a c 4 through c 6 incomplete It took me over a year and half of trying to have an orgasm under I looked into the Ferticare vibrater which definitely did the job It s just super expensive   deleted Have you tried EDEX for your erection Aprostidil I think is the actual drug name Its an injection directly in the shaft of the penis and it doenst work everytime for me but its the only thing that works over 80  of the timeThat s way more subtle than the hitachi  I call it  the karaoke microphone   It helps more than you know  it made me cry but it also helps to know I m not alone If you ever want to talk just reach outWhere would a normal straight laced guy with normal straight laced friends find these psychedelics This   I m a 34yr old male T6 complete SCI para going on 14  years now since my injury  I didn t have a single orgasm for about 5 years after my injury until another SCI friend of time told me about using a vibrator  LIFE CHANGER  I bought the Hitachi Magic Wand and the first time I used it I prob orgasmed within 15 seconds no joke despite not having any sensation down there  I guess it had been a while lol   For any you out there struggling to orgasm try using a vibrator  Everyone is different so by no means can I guarantee it will work for all but I have a lot of SCI friends that have had good results with vibrators   Two other things that have dramatically improved my sex life   1  using penile injections  Tri Mix or EDEX  instead of oral pills  e g Viagra Cialis  especially for a complete SCI para like me  no sensation   The pills were simply cutting my performances short  We re all different so please do consult your urologist first   2  the Intimate Rider   YouTube it   Boy was this a game changer I only wish I would ve gotten it much sooner  It s a bit pricey but absolutely worth every penny   Lastly like anything in life confidence in your own sexuality post SCI comes with time and practice  The sooner you can get over the stigma of trying all the recommendations mentioned above and by others and start practicing the better off you ll be  Over time you ll start to take control of your sexual experiences and be more confident  You just have to try things out and see what works for you  Again definitely consult your doctor on some of these as some may having unique circumstances   Hang in there with time and practice you will get better and more confident Look into the EDEX injections and if that doesnt work consider a penile implant Prob with ferticare is that once the internal batteries die it s dead I have a friend who has hacked into his and changed the batteries but it takes a lot of work and dang it is expensive just to trash it otherwise I have one and it never workedLSD and Depressionpsycehedelics have changed my life for the better I became obsessed with learning everything I could about them and have read 12 books now    I wasn t a big drinker but I was drinking higher gravity beers and just getting really buzzed every night    One night after a larger LSD dose I poured one of my favorite craft beers  around 10  ABV  and it had this really weird taste  I thought the beer was bad so I had my partner taste it and she said it was fine  So I tried a different beer and it was the same thing   Told a psychonaut friend about it and he knew exactly the culprit  Plant medicines were telling me that alcohol was poison and no good for me    I still enjoy beer but I ve not even had a buzz since then and that was about 3 years ago    Now I make a low dose  1 gram or less  tea about once every 10 15 days and then I do larger trips every 3 4 months  I do these solo with the intention of healing grounding and connect with all living things   I ve also become artistic  NEVER was before  with painting and photography making terrariums and little crafts    They ve changed my life in the most magnificent positive ways healing traumas and expanding my mind    I have some mild spasms in the beginning but I think cannabis helps to calm them  and helps potentiate the psychedelic  I did schrooms a few times It killed my addictions iPhone and games It s a n amazing experience not scary and you don t feel  out of it  like heavy drinking or monged like mdma  Highly recommended regardless of depression cure Did you have any spasms  it didnt cure anything but it did give me a better perspective DMT gave me a crazier perspective  Also  it did give me spasms so  use at own discretion  Yes extremely bad spasms in my legs but i just mentally prepare that its going to happen and I ve mostly gotten over it I definitely don t concentrate on it anymore unless someone mentions the whole bed or couch is shakingRecreational drugsI have out of control spasms on LSD and shrooms I have neither decreased or increased spasms from cannabis  Same they re the worst on lsd and shrooms manageable on mdma I ve heard people taking baclofen before taking drugs never tried it personally though  C5 completes here Took shrooms three years after my injury and didn t realize how much my legs would spasm I figured I was having autonomic dysreflexia due to the poison in the magic mushrooms Honestly the spasms ruined my trip I did LSD before my injury and enjoyed it but I don t think I want to do it if I m going to spasm the whole time If anyone finds a solution please post it here   I use cannabis every day and have been for the past two years I m actually on a tolerance break right now  on my third day  and my nerve pain has been acting up Not sure if those two are correlated My favorite recreational drug is Xanax because it completely knocks out my nerve pain and I love the feeling it gives me Normally I take 1mg Definitely very addicting and I wouldn t recommend taking it more than twice a month Would love to hear of other drugs that SCIs enjoy  Does your doctor ever drug test you for the Vicodin Is he cool with the marijuana use   D8 complete  Once I tried LSD I gave me too many spasms such as you and a few cold sweats other than that the trip was good do you experience any other fiscal problems that I should be aware of im planning to take a full tab next month  It took years for me to find a VA Doctor that would prescribe me pain pills with my marijuana use but he made me get a medical marijuana card and after that he was fine with it Not that i cant think of  definitely have a pool or cold shower available if you start overheating I would recommend a trip sitter and telling them what to expect and have them read about autonomic dysriflexia so they can recognize if you need hospital attention Dont be afraid of the hospital either if you meed to go they cant arrest you or share info with the cops Any fellow quadriplegic SCIs have impacted teeth removed I had mine removed 4 years ago after my SCI Hurts like a bitch but you get to have loads of ice cream later to relieve the pain  That s the best part Apart from that  you don t really feel anything because your mouth is under anesthesia Good luck May I ask why are you getting your tooth or teeth removed  Yes the pain is after Thank you anesthesia I had one of my canines removed It broke from the root due to the impact during my accident Thank God I was wearing a helmet no other major injuries except my spine  D I am a T 4 incomplete  C5 6 I had 6 wisdom teeth removed about 2 years post injury I was given laughing gas and whatever numbing agent they used They didn t want to put me out I brought music to drown out anything else I still bring music now any time I get a filling It was a pretty short process with very little pain afterwards During the procedure there s just pressure you feel it s more mental than anything I m glad I only was given gas I wouldn t worry much about getting it done I assume the pain or discomfort is different for everyone but I didn t even use any of the pain meds they gave me  Had a bunch removed   all the wisdom teeth impacted one another and it was fine for me All right So the pain is after   And I am getting a molar  non wisdom  removed Kind of pushing another tooth out of its socket or whatever Also thinking about getting one or two wisdom teeth removed   Thank you so much Out of curiosity I am c5 What level are you Re using cathetersWash them in soap and hot water and put them in a paper bag   like a school lunch bag  you can find this information on Google   Unfortunately some single use catheters simply aren t made for reuse and are impossible to steralize The old school red rubber caths can be reused but at the end of the day just if you are going to run out buy some inexpensive ones off the web I use allegro medical and they have some fairly inexpensive caths that can get you by until your regular ones arrive  People reuse all the time although it s not the best option As mentioned red rubber and plastic catheters can be cleaned and reused but pre lubed ones shouldn t be The dry lube can only rehydrate once or twice and can cause damage to your urethra like micro traumas that cause inflammation There are countries that still believe old evidence and only cover 1 catheter a day and even these don t recommend reuse for more than a day Each  I have a completely different catheter it silicone comes in a tube filled with water so you take it out and put it back in the water after used it lasts for about 6 months Oh yeah totally done that stuff just how it goes when you re in a pinch Sometimes stuff goes wrong and just gotta work with what you ve got If you get an infection you get an infection better than kidney damage from holding on too long or even just the indefinite discomfort  You have to pay to get supplies    But yes I have re used many times without getting an UTI  Here s my old routine when I was self cathing A bit over the top but I have very in frequent UTIs so hopefully this inspires you   1 At the end of the day a small bundle of catheters that I used are put in one hand all facing the same way and rinsed under hot water inside and out so all the semi dry lubricant is washed away   2 Bundle is allowed to soak in a tall container  I used a tall glass cylinder similar to what barbers keep their combs in  filled with your favorite anti septic solution I tried several different things like isopropyl alcohol ethanol hydrogen peroxide  chlorhexidine   3 At the end of the week The bulk of the catheters are taken out rinsed thoroughly and then I fill up a clean plastic container with hot soapy water and use my hands to agitate the catheters back and forth so that water is thoroughly forced through them I rinse with regular tapwater  you may want to rinse with some kind of deionized water  and holding them in one hand I would sling or whip them so as to force any water remaining inside the catheters out   4 Now that they re as free as water as I can mechanically remove I lay them out on a paper towel to air dry   5 Finally  this is the over the top part  I bought a ultraviolet sterilizer meant for manicure tools  very similar to this one  https   www amazon com dp B01AOJA858   and I d leave the catheters in there for any number of hours without experiencing any problems Then I d take them out as needed for the day I d throw them out and replace them with new ones if I saw scratches or deposits that I couldn t remove  That s shit  My cousin lives in Boston I nearly threw up when she said how much it costs to have a baby  I had my accident  Ambulance to a n e  Intensive spinal unit then   I spent 9 months in specialist spinal unit 6 weeks in intensive care 24 7 care turned every 4 hours  physio hydro etc etc etc then 3 months in a hotel for disabled ppl before my release   by bill  ZERO My care was epic  The nhs is not perfect  But it works I m a staunch believer in capitalism with a small c with taxes I am a business owner still There s no better system so far  But government plays a BIG role in society Education  Law and order  Welfare  HEALTH CARE  Heath care cannot be run for profit  I was taught this as one of a few methods while in rehab after the injury They were okay with me doing clean cath instead of sterile so the washing with soap and water  I ve always been nonlatex cath gang  was another method   The methods    wash in soap and water   Put it in a bowl and pour literally boiling water over it   use iso alcohol but rinse thoroughly to avoid irritation   could even keep them in a clean jar with boiling water and Castile soap put the lid on it use the next day   I ve heard stories that suggest not all SCI rehabs teach it I have no idea why Emergencies happen This is suboptimal to a new sterile catheter every time but it keeps you healthy  I knew a guy that licks his catheters to  lube them up  before inserting Hasn t had a UTI in years   I HAVE USED THE SAME CATHETER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME AND NEVER CLEANED IT I HAVE NOT HAD A UTI FOR 8 YEARS   But back in the day before the new method I would get a UTI every month for years I tried every one of the washing techniques described and posted on every forum but nothing worked I was back and forth from doctor to doctor   Eventually I was so lost that I called the spinal injury support center and asked for a nurse to home visit Without me going on for days she told me this No soaps or alcohol and no lube Just use a bamboo baby wipe  I use a brand named GAIA NATURAL  and get laser polished catheters one size smaller  APOGEE catheters white for gauge   Technique is to bunch up the wipe around the tip and squeeze some fluid into the catheter drop that sucker down your urethra wetting it with the wipe on the way down and bingo Afterward pull it out and chuck it on its hook in the bathroom  most of the time on the floor     You can take it or leave it But a box of 50 Cathers is still going 8 years later  I use cliny kit catheters They are designed to be reused You put glycerol in the tube that the catheter is stored in It s a bit messy but it also acts as lube    You take the cath out of the tube use it Rinse well stick it back in the tube   They cost way more but a single cath can last a month The glycerol needs to be changed every 5 days or so as the level goes down First sign of a uti and swap to a new cath just in case   The tube will last 3 months and you can get the caths by themselves to use in it   It is a lot easier to carry too compared to a bunch of single use ones  I might be preaching to the converted I m in the UK and I haven t really had the need to reuse catheters as they are free Although I have on holiday using the same ideas and haven t had a problem   I have however had problems in spite of using sterile catheters over the years  It s the point of entry   However I have found that using some sort of wet wipe whether it s anti bacterial wipes or just a simple wet wipe Is it really effective way of reducing firstly the stinging cystitis and then subsequent full on UTIs  I got a bit side tracked with idea of sterilisation and anti bacterial products to  kill gems   around the area of entry  its is a red herring I have found is that using alcohol  ouch  or harsh chemicals and anti bacterial agents isn t practical or effective for the reasons you might think The fact is that you can never fully sterilise that area  However using clean ordinary wet wipes has the effect to greatly reduce the amount of bacteria around the entry point and therefore vastly reducing chances of infection  It does this amazingly by physically removing them by wiping away I don t know if everybody knew this but I really didn t I thought you had to  kill bacteria  with anti bacterial agents or a harsh chemicals or something  Wiping really works  The same principle applies to soap and water When washing your hands Soap does not really have a great deal of affect on killing bacteria however the mixture of running water and the lather mobilises the bacteria and physically removes them from your hands  It is therefore a very effective way of reducing infections  Hence why it is still used in hospitals today  So as much as you would like to fuss over sterilising your catheter as important to that routine is adding in an additional steps to simply wipe the end of your dick a few times with a clean baby wipe and wash your hands regularly will really help  This is also the reason that sadly ladies are more prone to infections as it s much harder to remove the natural bacteria prior to entry   allegro medical  Can you buy without a prescription At the start I was given 1 catheter a week  I don t miss those days america  https   www youtube com watch v VYOjWnS4cMYWe advise people if they have to reuse to heat catheters up in the microwave after rinsing to kill any bacteria then store them in a new ziplock bag Never heard the UV light trick interesting I was in intensive care for only a month and a half shipped ASAP to rehab sent home ASAP got waaayyyy less care than you did and STILL had to pay a shit ton  And I had insurance  The older folks here have lived this way their entire lives and it s all they know  They can t comprehend a system like yours And they re told from right wing media here how you guys are dying in the streets because you can t get the care you need with your awful socialized medicine  I can sum it up for you though  This country is owned by the mega rich and they control us  They divert our attention so we ignore their corruption   Sorry to get on a political rant  but it s really damn frustrating for folks with medical needs that our system is soooo broken Done this HOLY SHIT this is amazing  I haven t had a UTI in a while so what the hell this will be worth it if it works   I m clear except the laser polished catheters Do I just ask my supply company for that particular style  Or are you saying APOGEE is the brand    Did you get the bamboo baby wipes at a grocery store or where I ve never heard of these Our healthcare system in the U S is just mind boggling to the rest of the world  I pay about a hundred USD on catheters alone each month  Hopefully one of these days our system will catch up with the 21st century Does anyone else take adderall I don t take it but I have read that stimulants can affect the contraction of the bladder s spincter I read this while searching for info about urinary retention Also    Muscles in the digestive tract are slowed down by Adderall use which may lead to constipation abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal issues   I used to take it all the time to party with before the accident Haven t taken it yet since which has been about 7 months but I will try it sometime and report back  Hi u knockout350   Nurse here Yes Adderall can cause diarrhea  Also constipation which sounds weird but is true   Some things to try if you re paranoid about it happening again  take it about 30 minutes before you take other meds And don t swallow it with coffee Only water  Been taking adderall for a while and yes it does very much make me have to go the bathroom Thats a side effect  I started coffee again after not having ANY caffeine since 2007  I LOVE coffee but it doesn t love me  It s been wreaking havoc on my bowels and bladder and I guess I m going to have to quit again  adderall triggers my muscle spasticity something fierce particularly in my shoulders neck super uncomfortable and can trigger migraines it s a shame since i have spasms all night long so during the day i walk around in a fatigued haze  i m a partial c5 c6 walker   Okay I have tried the Addiez now and will let you know tomorrow if it hits me in any way Also how much were you taking I usually did 15 30mg and took 20 this time  Saw that it were experiencing some constipation  is that still happening  I get mild abdominal pain but constipation is the exact opposite of my issue I actually stopped the oxybutanin because I leaned I could go without and just my myrabetriq but it was causing constipation issuesThanks I think it may have just been a one off from starting the meds because I haven t pooped in 3 days now so I think it s reversed course Always fun dealing with an sciI haven t had to much issue with that I do notice I have to stop and stretch out more often though but I don t sleep for shit without melatonin and a heating pad for nerve pain anyways Yeah im on the 20xr had an issue with diarrhea when I first started but now it s all leveled out now It does cause spasms to kick up now though Are we more vulnerable to the corona virus with sci Nah cause we don t leave the house lol I have heard about this immune system stuff and I think it s correct My partner has an L1 incomplete injury 10 months in He s been sick a few times already since the injury while I ve shared his saliva and got nothing Fever a few times some UTI related sore throat colds He is also mobile He got blood testing done recently and one of his WBC was higher  At 6 months out with an L1 injury you are no more at risk than you would be without SCI   In general the higher the level  for example I can t cough like an able bodied person but you can  and or the longer you have been injured the more your SCI factors into your flu risk  The biggest problem is the risk of pneumonia with any kind of respiratory infection which includes Covid 19 The inability to cough and expel mucous leads to pneumonia and further reducing the ability to absorb oxygen into the bloodstream This applies more to C6 and up so your L1 isn t as big of a risk  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC5029284  Are we more vulnerable to the flu Yes you were told that   so that s really the fact you need to be focusing on and getting the flu jab taking precautions The thing about the corona virus right now is that we don t know a lot about it beyond the cases that we ve observed that s why it is being framed as scary  we don t know really what it does and there isn t currently a known treatment Altough you re right it seems to most negatively impact old people people with lung issues and people with preexisting health conditions That could include SCI and its impact on the immune system   Though I wouldn t worry massively about it   the media are whipping up irresponsible amounts of panic surroundin COVID 19 and as of current the phrase to remember is Alert Not Anxious Just wash your hands and generally go about your business as you would to avoid the flu I don t know what country you re in but follow your governmental guidelines as well as that of the CDC   I vaguely considered this my coughing is impacted a little being an incomplete quad   but then I dismissed the concern because it is no where near me and the few cases here are very monitored and in hospital Much like very severe cases of the flu  Weaker immune system Depends on degree of injury and level of mobility So in short yes  I feel I m going to start giving out Lysol spray to my reddiwheel drivers so we can spray down the seatbelt and seats  I might be talking out of my ass however the reduction in the efficacy of the immune system is surely related to being inactive and then therefore less physically fit with it s related Heath issues rather than the spinal injury itself been the causal factor in the reduction of the immune system   Heyyyy  good to see you out   Corona Virus   I think I ll try to get hold of the primary doctor i had at the rehabilitation hospital   As I replied to another user I did get the common flu even though I got the flu shot as soon as it was available I ll let you guys know if I get any new information from the hospital Why is the flu risk higher if it is longer since the injury That s an interesting study especially because they found effects for both innate and adaptive immunity I would add some caveats viral titer is probably a decent surrogate to how  infective  it is but not necessarily Different viruses may have different effects and this study is done on mice so a follow up human study would be great For Covid 19 and flu it carries more risk for quads and thoracic level paras because they have reduced pulmonary function and would suffer more once infected If anyone hasn t gotten flu vaccine they should And if it starts getting more widespread avoid large gatherings and make sure everyone is washing their hands Ok so because nerve signals having a chance of being disrupted the immune system below the point of injury could be affected Much of the immune system is within the bowels right My stool is not like it was before injury and has not improved It is like many small ping pong balls like an elk or a deer I did get the flu even with the vaccine so I guess I should take precautions My mobility is good I can take long walks in the woods without any aids   Why does mobility have an impact here Activities for SCI10 years post as well SCI is a lonley life Your friends stop coming around family moves on It may seem trivial to you but just hanging out and watching TV with someone is letting him know that you give a shit Don t feel you have to buy a brain controlled chess set or anything simply showing up is always welcome  Hey bro I m 10 years post SCI I only remember the friendship and support of my visitors not what we did Just hang out and talk about normal shit You are a true friend just being there   Oh yea don t talk about how paraplegic people can still ski and ride bikes and ATV s that sort of shit it offers no comfort   Your a good man  My injury was the last time I saw most of my  BFFs  I m also about 10 years out  Keep doing what you re doing It helped when there was sports on because it would give us something to watch I started watching hockey around this time of year and have been hooked ever since When I had my tracheostomy I literally went crazy I had bad psychosis because I couldn t communicate at all My arms and hands didn t work A few weeks later they put a cap over the trache hole and was able to speak I wish they would ve done that for a minute or two a day just so I could tell them I wanted to change the channel Anyway just keep visiting and maybe read to him if he ever enjoyed that sort of thing  Could you get him a laptop and something like a Tobii eye tracker that works with free software like https   github com OptiKey OptiKey so he can communicate Or a quick printout of something like www communicationchart com  free    If you are running out of stuff to talk about and can hook up a console to his tv you could maybe bring a console   somewhat slow game with a good storyline with you and play that for a while and talk about what to do in the game   Less boring than tv movies get after a while I think One of those interactive decisions matter games might be fun also if he still can t communicate but can do yes no by looking left right up down whatever works   There are ways to make a game controller quad friendly and there are games that work with eye trackers but if you want info on that better ask some of the quads here I just googled Good luck  Glad to hear that the surgery went well I think he would just appreciate having the company to be honest   My trach period was probably my most frustrating because I couldn t talk Looking back my parents created an alphabet chart on paper so I could communicate with them with my eyes Maybe get him something to use so he can do the same  I m 19 years out and have no friends really or family I always appreciated people just coming around telling stories from their lives watching TV even scratching and massaging my head  So long as it s not painful   I had a trachea and would mouth a letter and someone would type it until they knew what I was asking for or was trying to say Much easier than the letter chart  10  years also here Just keep doing what your doing man THIS COMMENT    I ve been binging on the show Survivor lately so I m thinking I ll pick a season and watch an episode every time I come My family is making sure someone goes and sees him in rehab every day They have 7 8 sports channels so we make sure his games he wants to watch get written on the board Thanks for your response Thanks friend Yeah we have one of those letter boards and also a list of common requests So far he doesn t like using the letter board He s always been easily frustrated so I think unless it s really important if we can t read lips he just mouths nevermind I haven t had any alone time with him yet but tomorrow I m going to see if he ll use the letter board to say anything to me because I just want him to communicate with me and know exactly what He s saying even if it s just a word I really really hope the trach comes out soon It s been almost 2 months I just want to bring him some chick fil a Start up looking to meet people with spinal cord injury to understand their situationI

cane I m a Paralympic swimmer and also play sled hockey and wheelchair basketball  Low cervical AIS C here I think you could talk to universities around you and see if their disability resource centers would be willing to reach out to disabled students there I m in college and there tends to be at least a few students with SCI and similar issues at most large schools and most of us are open to being involved in this type of research  I would reach out to non profit groups that support stroke victims after hospital care  My mother had a stroke last year and the local  Kingston not that far from Waterloo  region has local resources for her to join to exercise with others at the YMCA and other facilities  Pretty much what you are looking for I think      Feel free to contact me directly for more info  I am a 25 year old C6 quadriplegic as of 2013 I live downtown Toronto Feel free to message me T2 T3 incomplete feel free to DM me That s a great idea didn t think of that We re pretty close to a few universities so that s one to look into Thanks a lot We re definitely looking into that Thanks Will reach out if I got questions   How to not go broke paying for medical stuffSCI means you get automatically approved for disability I am lucky  well everything is relative  not to have a high level SCI so can still work but my understanding is medicare will pay for a power chair catheters and some reimbursement for care givers   Maybe someone who is on government programs can describe what is covered I would start applying yesterday not matter what it takes 4 months  I think  If you are in the United States check with the nurse case manager or social worker at the rehab facility about Medicaid Medicaid in most states offers sure worker type services in addition to whatever other care would be covered by Medicare Most facilities have someone who will help facilitate the initial application for Medicaid Plus they have resources to direct you to low cost services to apply for Medicare disability Often the services are cheaper than attorneys The money comes from your initial disbursement  Did he have a life insurance policy at the time of the accident Many have an Accident Death and Dismemberment rider Losing function in a limb counts as dismemberment under all of the life policies I have seen  Simone needs to contact social security now There should be social workers at the rehab to help He is eligible for catastrophic approval Very quick and includes full health insurance They will pay the three months prior to applying for medical bills It all starts and ends at your Social Security office Good luck  I just wanted to say that I m so sorry you re going through that I fractured my spinal cord and was in the hospital for close to 8 months I live in Canada so it was all covered I can t imagine    I hope you find some helpful resources  Move to the UK There really is no such thing as  automatic approval  anymore I mean you won t be denied but you still have to go through the whole approval process  As a previous commenter said that can take 6 months   year But yes they will pay 80  of the cost of a chair most medical supplies etc  You are on the hook for 20  of stuff so it s wise to look into a Medigap  effectively a Part C  plan     HOWEVER   if he s not retirement age sadly he will need to be disabled  that is from when he starts his disability benefits   SSDI  for two years before he s eligible for Medicare So get that ball rolling now   If he himself is super duper poor  like under  16k a year  he can get Medicaid health insurance I applied in March of 2019 and got approved in September Still didn t receive my first dispersement until December Thank you very much Happy healing to you Should I tell them I am in a wheelchair If it s in person then yes let them know ahead of time  I never do  they ll obviously find out in the interview All my jobs have been office jobs in a cubicle so being in a wheelchair doesn t affect me doing the job I was a cashier at a fast food place when I was a teenager  was working there when I got hurt  I returned to work months later   Good luck   Remember to report your wages if you re on disability I m always upfront and transparent about being in a wheelchair For example back when I was doing online dating I had at least one picture of me in my chair and mentioned in my profile in a joking fashion As far as jobs go though I ve had my fair share over the years and never did I once mention that I was in a wheelchair when simply applying If you get an interview they ll obviously find out then and there and they don t need to know beforehand Only once was I ever turned down because of the wheelchair Job would have required a lot of flying on a company jet to private runways that wouldn t always be accessible  How can u maneuver in that lil bit of space  Isn t it illegal if they ask what accommodations you need or what disability you have But idk whether to tell them  I Second thisThank you I m nervous for the interview I dislike people asking me question maybe that s why I don t date Haha reply I don t know I ve never been inside that particular store I have a manual wheelchair chair so it s less comberson I might be in for a surprise I just filled out this application as a fluke I m a little concern most of these chain store company s are not hiring the disabled in particular wheelchair folks I am in California Lots of laws out here Just need to ventI hear you  A few years ago I was dealing with spasms that would come about every five minutes  So just enough time to start to drift off to sleep  only to feel like someone s shaking you awake  For hours  I took sleep aids pretty often during that time which is of course not good for you but I didn t know what to do    Mine subsided a lot because I eventually got a much needed spinal fusion so I don t have any advice for you  sorry   But I understand  I don t think I have any helpful advice but I just wanted to say I m sorry for what you re dealing with I have spasms spasticity that definitely impact my QoL but they don t sound near as bad as yours   What country are you in I m guessing the US based on the insurance denials but I know other countries do health insurance too If they finally approved the trial is there any way you can have it done somewhere other than the place that s  at capacity    The only other thing I m gonna toss out there is Valium I know you said you d tried meds but you didn t specify all of them I m guessing so if you haven t tried Valium but know someone who would prescribe it it might be worth trying I use it though definitely on a limited basis when I really need the relief because of the dependency issues when it s taken regularly   deleted  Have you tried yoga  I really hope that you are able to get the pump I was in a very similar situation Maximum oral dose of baclofen tizanidine and Botox  The oral stuff really made me tired all the time Needing to nap like an hour after taking it I also found that it really made me kind of mentally clouded Hard to focus on things Getting the pump straight up changed my life I could finally go down the street without feeling like I m going to fall out of my chair from my spasms Actually get decent sleep at night And not be practically falling asleep during the day at any moment I really know the frustrations that you re going through so best of luck finally getting the surgery  Also just so you know when you get the trial it makes you completely flaccid Which is actually a little weird because I didn t realize that some of my spasticity helped my transfers But don t worry When you get the pump you fine tune your dosage to get the perfect amount that works for you  I second this My spasticity isn t THAT bad just when I go from a sitting to straightened position then all hell breaks loose  But smoking and edibles help me sleep almost the entire night It s in his second sentence AI Robotic Arm Assisting Quadriplegicshold a slice of pizza  or sandwich   or hamburger See if I can wipe my own ass suppository insertion without  errors   Overthrow the bourgeoisie Play video games possibly  Like others have said  handheld foods Also eating utensils a cell phone pens cups a comb toothbrush a jacket zipper maybe a door handle some type of bag AirPods etc Really anything that s practical for everyday use  Curious if you ve heard of the  Kinova robotic arm   https   www kinovarobotics com en products assistive technologies kinova jaco assistive robotic arm  I would almost recommend trying to find something that your arm might do better than this one Or something it may offer that this doesn t  I like the use of machine learning AI or eyegaze  Voice control may also be interesting A lot of feedback I hear from folks using the kinova are that it s hard to control I ve also seen them pretty beat up bc of where they mount if wheelchairs and their size making them prone to getting smashed in doorways and small spaces I would also reinforce getting it to do anything that a paid caregiver might do in order to demonstrate to insurers that the cost of the arm would save in the cost of care providers  I d love a robotic arm to grasp my delicate object     also where do I sign up to test your beer slamming iris tracking terminator thumbs up giving wonder arm I would 2nd this but I wouldn t be the tester guinea pig Is that the T 1000 main operating protocol Thanks for your input   We are actually working with the Jaco2 from Kinova however as you say control can be hard given that it has many degrees of freedom and quads generally don t have the mobility to control all of them properly which is why we would like to  smart it up    Voice commands are actually planned as well such that the arm can determine whether it should i e pick and place something or grasp something to eat Does anyone tell people a made up story of how they were injured I don t personally do it but I don t see anything wrong with it especially if it makes you uncomfortable talking about it Don t feel guilty we have enough other stuff to worry about with SCIs I was injured in Afghanistan when an IED went off and flipped the Suburban I was in I wasn t in the military at the time I was working as a contractor basically a glorified bodygaurd I just tell people I was in a car accident If I add IED Afghanistan I get   thank you for your service  which I don t want to take credit for and don t want to explain why It is no ones business how you got in a chair I wouldn t sweat it  If you re going to lie might as well have fun with it   A crazy lady pushed me over the rail for the lion exhibit at the zoo A skydiver landed on me in a freak accident My neighbor went crazy and started chasing me with an axe until I fell in a hole  Oh I do this as a bit I was actually injured as a passenger in a car accident but I got tired of telling ppl that Specifically I got tired of that being the first question someone asks me when they meet me My favorite  reason  is autoerotic asphyxiation Ppl get REAL uncomfortable I usually say none of your business and laugh people feel so awkward when I make that statement that it gives me a little bit of a chuckle At the end of the day you don t owe anyone an explanation of your injury Just say something like why don t we talk about something else or there are other important matters Tell people about your injury only if you want to considering we lose control over our life take control by telling people when you feel comfortable It s a confidence booster and I think it s fair because people don t understand that just because you have an injury doesn t mean you need to talk about it  Bruh making up stories on how you are in a chair is the best part imho  I usually go with  the chute didn t open  or  tragic jousting accident back when I worked at Medieval Times    It s fun Not on a regular basis but with people how are clearly going to be annoying or in front of friends that know the truth and will get a huge kick out of it I ll occasionally make up a story I don t remember many but I know that I once said  Death by snu snu didn t work on me   My SCI is super rare and the explanation invites complete doubt It s exhausting to explain in the face of disbelief So yeah I ve just agreed it s from a car crash many times  i like to go with saving a baby from a burning building i also tell ppl my feeding tube scar is a gun shot wound lol Don t feel guilty for not answering a very personal question asked by someone you likely don t even know very well  It s none of their business   Of course if you want to be honest go ahead  But really you re under no obligation to them  Just understand that it is your choice so feel OK to make that choice yourself  It s up to you whether or not you share your story  Why bother to lie  I just explain what happened and answer any follow up questions they have It s not so bad The more you do it the better you get at it I m a c4 I know what you re going through But there s no reason to be embarrassed and if you don t lie there s no reason to feel guilty Just my opinion  I used to do it when I worked retail and got asked several times a day It was just for fun But mostly people get different versions of the story depending on how well I know them  For literally any injury I have ever had I go with the  I ran into a burning building to save a baby  line This is also acceptable for papercut  Most people notice and ask why my hand is in a soft brace first and I just gesture the ever eloquent masturbation motion and say  a little too much lately    Usually breaks the ice and brings out a smile so I can smoothly transition to telling them I was actually shot in the face  I start with  Gunned down by a mob of jealous husbands     I m actually pretty open about my injury  fall at a construction site  but it s okay if you aren t  I suspect that most people are actually trying to protect their own sense of security   Well it ll never happen to ME because I don t work construction      There s also  I walked up to a guy in a wheelchair and asked the wrong kind of question   Lately my go to is  walking is beneath me  I used to but now I see the folly of my ways Lying to people is not great especially about something so personal I explain and answer as many questions as I can I find it helps them to understand me and disability as a whole I feel like if I give them honesty and treat them with respect then the next disabled person they run into they will return the feelings If I lie to them and disrespect them then they will see people with disability as jerks and not be respectful to the next person they meet If you dont want to talk about it then say that please dont lie it is not a good message to send to others    I usually say I was in a car crash and the conversation stops there   You could say it was a sports injury  Run over by a dump truck is usualy enough  I knew someone who always said the sex swing broke Hubby tells a different story to everyone who asks  Definitely depends on the situation When it s just a random person on the street I sometimes have lied and said it was a car accident when in reality it was a diving accident   It just makes the interaction faster because they tend to have more questions when I tell the truth I do every once in a while but usually after I tell  them  the real story   I broke my neck diving into a pool but that s a boring story so I m going to start telling people I was skydiving or bull riding like my quadriplegic friend actually did   Why not  What are  they  going to do Fact check you Lol Tagging u organic_hobnob here because he posted something about this in a more recent post  There was a typo on a local news station website a few years back Marine loses leg to IUD   Perhaps you should make a small tweak to your story and see who notices  Hahah I

don t have tips but I damn sure could use some how did u set everything up cuz I would love to set my room up so I can exercise on my own Thanks for the inspiration yes we gotta keep fighting as much as we hate this shit Nice man very cool idea  I usually figure out or ask others about ideas on how to set up things I want to work on The pulley is just a  15 pulley I ordered from amazon I had a friend drill eye screws or bolts into my ceiling so I can attach the pulley and other things over head I also had a square of fencing from home depot affixed to two walls and you can attach things in front of you Keep fighting I m sorry I m not great at explaining things but I will try to explain as best I can so feel free to ask Got to keep trying I haven t come close to figuring out how to do what I know I m capable of but there is always a wayHow do you shower while traveling I put a towel into the bottom of the bathtub to sit on and transfer onto the side of the tub then slowly into the bottom of the tub Getting out I can only do if there are grab bars transfer back onto the side of the tub  with another towel laid over the side of the tub to protect my butt  then transfer into the chair  I always pack a shower bench It breaks down and stores in a Pelican type case   I don t trust the benches that hotels provide They vary in shape size and condition By traveling with my own I can avoid worrying about taking a shower   If you are flying you can pack a fairly large  Pelican case  https   www pelican com us en product cases transport case protector 1630  full of equipment and  it ll fly for free  https   www transportation gov individuals aviation consumer protection wheelchairs and other assistive devices  if it s marked as Disability Aids I d travel with a shower bench padded toilet seat catheters and other necessities The airlines never charged me for carrying it as baggage as long as it was properly marked   Most hotels I have stayed in have acceptable shower benches The exceptions are very cheap and super expensive ones If you are staying for a couple days and the shower bench sucks Amazon has reasonable ones for 60 bucks and if you are a prime member you can get it next day for 70    Then I just leave it  I try to get the low down from the hotels ahead of time   newer hotels are typically better regarding accessibility and I find Marriott brands to be good too  i like roll in showers with fold down benches   but I have taken my rubbermaid carex seat in my car before  you can typically rent a shower bench in a town from a med supply place if you want to have one delivered to the hotel goesanywhere com makes a bunch of cool products That s the way I manage Hotel benches are crud most of the time You wouldn t think we don t live in the dark ages any longer Thank you for this tip I m traveling to Austin later this year and was trying to figure this out This is looking like my most economical option  Thanks  Honestly may even dry it out and return it via prime  I spent 10 months in bed eight of which in the hospital laying mostly flat on my back without the use of my hands but I could still play Civ Jacked up on Valium I made a video how to improve the game for quadriplegics 4000  hrsAwesome  Dude nice I d be so annoyed with the head tracker  Hi  I played a lot of Civ as well    you should definitively check out XCOM 2 it is made by Firaxis as well You can often find a bundle on discount on Steam   It is a turn based tactical squad game with lots of content If you can play Civ you should be able to XCOM as well from what I see in your videos   I play it using a GlassOuse headmouse with a bite clicker   2 buttons for mouse right click and scroll up Most other functions are clickable on screen except the escape key for bringing up the main menu  Complex Regional Nerve PainI have just started down the road to diagnosis Pain is unreal  I was rx d gabapentin for central sensitization which is similar No side effects I use before bed  I m actually on gabapentin baclofen and duloxetine for nerve pain from the spinal surgery Unfortunately the dosage I m on isn t doing what it used to I may have to talk to my doc about upping it gain I just want a little relief Salt and snowIt s just something you gotta deal with I try to make sure I don t wipe my hands on my pants regardless of how wet and salty they are and I generally go wash my hands as soon as I get inside a building I haven t don t this but you could try carrying a salt rag to briefly clean your rims and wipe off your hands when you enter a building and then stow it away  I ll carry a small hand towel in my backpack to wipe things off when I get somewhere if I care about the place like say a friend s house  I drive everywhere I can and park in undergrounds if possible and seat covers for the spots I put my wheels in my car cause that shit gets filthy   Try gloves my dude They look a little ridiculous but they work for me in the snow I look like a fucking disgusting mess in the winter Salt everywhere The floors in my apartment are gross and I clean them constantly    very relatable Gloves  my partner uses utility work gloves because we live in central Alberta  and a second set of wheels to swap into once home if you re able to do that have worked quite well for us   Ideal situation having one chair for indoor usage at home and one chair for outdoor everywhere else really helps minimize the salt and snow everywhere   Carrying a small towel that you can use to dry your wheels off and such also helps  Finding it hard readjusting to my previous social and work life after injuryC4 5 incomplete walking quad injured in 2017 For me these adjustments have taken time The injury turned into the only thing I knew for awhile No matter what I was doing SCI was on the tip of my brain And still is to an extent But things eventually started to feel normal again Little things I didn t notice at first making a pot of coffee taking a piss getting dressed having a non health related conversation These little things add up and have learned new norms   Eventually a day will go by when your injury is not the most important thing in your life You ll talk to your friends and family about normal things You ll learn to live a normal life again just different than it was before  Give it time focus on recovery things will come back together for you  C4 5 incomplete walking quad since 07   In my experience everyone has a different reaction ranging from wanting to be there for you at anytime to fearing being by you because they don t know how to act   The silly notion that the new physical you somehow comes with a new personality of you drives many people to avoid social interactions   It s only when you become comfortable with the new you and are able to openly talk about your injury and new reality will some of those people come around   Relationships with others may never be the same but it helps you weed out who you should be hanging out with and who doesn t deserve your time to begin with   I found my pre injury social circle shrank and I built a new post injury social network that was stronger   7 months ago I moved away permanently and have been travelling since which has put building a brand new social network to the test Being completely open about my injury and comfortable with myself helps a lot and I find the topic of my injury actually helps break the ice and gives any stranger an opportunity to talk to me and vice versa   It won t happen overnight but the sooner you make peace with yourself and accept your new reality you will find moving forward with anything else much easier including your social life  Im a T7 para and Im 25 now but was injured about 4 1 2 years ago The things I couldnt do and the places I couldnt really go with my friends took a toll on me mentally and plus they all were like awkwardly sorry for me at first so that didnt help thing It was super awkward for a while but when I got used to me situation and they got more ised to seeing me in a wheelchair it got a little better It took at least a year after my injury for them to be normal with me and not act like I was some special kid lol Just took a while for me to feel comfortable in my chair talking to other people for me to come out of my shell   Once you feel comfortable in your situation you gotta put yourself out there I also started to play different wheelchair sports when I was finally able to  a year or so after  so that way I was able to meet other people in my situation  I don t think that your experience is uncommon My social life especially changed quite a bit after I started having serious medical issues and difficulty walking You didn t say your age but I think that can sometimes factor in I initially started having trouble when I was in high school at 16 and had to take time off school because I was in and out of the hospital so much There were some minor efforts by friends at that point to try and be supportive but by the time everything was said and done most of the people I was friends with prior to taking a break from school were no longer close to me and I don t think they could really understand the gravity of the situation   It was about 4ish years ago that things finally hit a point where I needed to start using a wheelchair full time  currently I m 32  and while some friendships have become much more superficial there are definitely a few that are just as strong as they were before I chalk that up to age and maturity   At the end of the day though I think that expecting everything to return to how it was before your injury might be a bit unrealistic Things are different now you are different now and that may mean needing to build new friendships if the current ones you have are no longer what they once were   It still hasn t been that long for you yet either so I would keep that in mind If you re saying that you haven t yet accepted and adapted to your new normal then perhaps expecting others to do so is a little bit unfair   If I could offer you some advice it would be two things  1  Talk to your friends Be honest and open about how you feel about your injury how it s changed things for you and how you re having a difficult time with adjusting to the social changes it s brought in particular Give your friends the benefit of the doubt and do what is within your control to try and help them understand  2  Be patient and don t expect things to ever be exactly as they once were You will find your new normal including your social life and all that But as you ve said it hasn t been too long yet and I d encourage you to focus on becoming more comfortable with yourself before you move on to working on outside relationships   I wish you the best of luck Maybe consider joining the Discord server and talking to those of us that are on there I ve found it to be quite helpful   ETA  You mentioned that those you ve spoken to about it haven t been able to be as supportive as you d like I think that likely has less to with whether they care or not and more to do with them not knowing exactly what you need to feel supported It might silly at first but sometimes explaining what they can do to support you can be all it takes Just as this is is uncharted territory for you the same can be said for them In my experience most people don t necessarily know how to support someone through such a life altering event and at times that can come across as uncaring when really it s just a lack of knowledge  and often a fear of saying or doing the wrong thing  Don t be afraid to tell your friends what them being supportive means to you and perhaps reassure them that they don t need to worry about doing or saying something  wrong    that you re still you  Thanks It helps knowing that I am not alone I have had days where I have been able to focus on other things than SCI and I do appreciate some little things like coffee and good food I do spend a lot of time in the forest and some days I am able to take it in relax and just be in the moment That helps and I appreciate those moments I hope I eventually will feel like I have gone through the changes that will happen and that my health is more stable from day to day Then I will know what my new normal is and I can focus on other things I m at that very uncomfortable point right now 6 months along a T6 7 Incomplete but starting to use a walker and crutches but still mostly wheelchair It s hard going from a life of partying every weekend to just wanting to not do anything and feeling pressured to go out or go to concerts  Hoping things get better  I know that things will be different going forward I feel different physically and I think my personality will change some as well because of this injury if not I will at least gain some perspective   I think some of my social issues I m having has to do with my friends and even some relatives are behaving and treating me just like before In this transition period of my life that is not what I need I have noticed that right now things that I used to spend time doing with my friends before seem pointless and a waste of time This is probably maybe a temporary thing that will change when I am used to the new normal   The surgeon that did the last operation on my back told me that most of the changes improvements to nerve damage and other issues related to the injury will happen during the first year Then it becomes less likely but some more changes can happen during the second year After that window of time has passed there s very low likelihood of improvements to the nerve damage I have This makes me focus a lot on my health and spending as much time as possible being active   This injury is a major life changer in many ways and I think it is just overwhelming to have to deal with it all myself Some days are good and I feel positive and energetic Other days can be painful slow and frustrating I guess I am just searching for a way to ease the path I have to walk It helps knowing I m not alone Thanks everyone for telling your story Shower bench chairsI didn t like the cheap quality of the  cushions  provided on my Drive bench So I cut a piece of 1 2  marine plywood rounded the corners and added threaded inserts I then shipped it off to  C Cushions  http   www ccushions com  here in Texas and had them make a  boat cushion  for me I removed the standard three pads and bolted on the replacement   Now I have a very well made cushion that s designed to withstand water and hold up in a wet environment It s completely seamless and sealed very well It will last much much longer than the vinyl covered cushions it replaces In addition it s a single piece with no gaps  which I have found can contribute to skin breakdowns   If it works for you maybe re order the same one Four years is a pretty good life for a padded tub bench If you change brands do make sure the dimensions are similar  I ve run into models that sit too high off the floor for most people  How are you people using non padded stuff  One shower on a hard surface and I m risking so much   I know you said bench but if you can use just a chair I just got this a couple months ago It is pricier but it s the best constructed chair I ve used  you do not need to use the arms rests They just snap in and out    https   smile amazon com Shower Armrests ComfortAble Institutional Quality dp B01IPZVI0C I got a cheap Rubbermaid stool that fits my tub shower about 15 years ago   I have a roho deflated nexus cushion  damn thing will not break https   www amazon com dp B004AC6UOO ref cm_sw_r_em_apa_i_nverEbJXB6M9N  This is what I use other than being a little creeky at times at been great  https   www amazon com gp aw d B008PC23QE   I use this one It s very sturdy As a male I find just putting a facecloth on it before sitting makes it more comfortable   deleted  Yeah am considering that The reviews I had been reading for the Drive bench seat weren t promising which is what I already have  Didn t know if anybody had good experiences with other brands like gaurdians or anything like that OP has a tub shower so he needs a transfer benchSame here as a person with a complete SCI for 20 years if I took one shower on a hard shower chair that would definitely be skin break city for me  Even in my younger years I was told to avoid the hard ones I used to use one similar have had to upgrade to something a little larger and more stable But thanks Bathtub  Which is why I switched from just a regular shower chair to the bench style  Good question thoughJobs I have been in the silicon valley working as a software engineer since the early 90s Getting remote work will be hard with little experience   Why remote I am a T8 complete and have no problems working on site   If you are set on remote start practicing interview programming questions Be serious about it time yourself do it in Google docs and not an IDE The only way you will get a job is to crush those in the interview process   Have a GitHub account and do a non trivial project Write a Android game or a micro service   There are companies moving to all remote work forces the problem is everyone wants that type of job so it s highly competitive Treat getting a job as a job  I have some friends that work in CS and software engineering for Banner hospitals and Blue Cross Blue Shield Depends on the position but some work fully from home others work half and half   I found out after I got my job  I work in finance  that my company was an affirmative action employer From my understanding they go out of their way to hire minorities and disabled people So it wouldn t be a bad idea to try and find those companies  Shouldn t be hard telework is becoming more common not just with CS EE major here but I have a friend who is a software engineer at Equifax He started out as an intern and he only had to be in office two days a week When he went full time he only had to be in office once a week  I m a t5 complete and I work both on site at my day job and remotely for some side hustles  You shouldn t have any trouble finding work  In my experience employers will o out of their way to accommodate  I ve never tried it myself but have a look at  Upwork  which is a freelancing platform They take a portion of what you make for fees which suck but it could be something to consider for now  im a software dev and t6 i work remotely 1 4 days a week i also get a lot of leeway to go to drs appointments  Its it took me about 2 3 years to get confident to go out on my own after my accident but now i get on the train get the best seat everyone is willing to help me  to the point of me being like fuck off weirdo  only thing that sucks is the once or twice a year when the train breaks down im stranded Ive had to wait for them to fix the train to get home always carry extra supplies  pants never know when you are going to be wearing your puma pants at work     be upfront with them and tell them why you have the gap  if its accident related  play that wheelie boye card haha      PAID RESEARCH PARTICIPATION     Looking for people with a physical disability from the UK     Contact prosociality hope ac uk   Study P3   in order to participate    We need more posts like this Maybe some US ones and or some borderless studies  Long car rides with bad backs yep same 4 hr drive to moms lives with 2 other family  i get real fidgety and uncomfortable real bad if we didnt get out a few time over the 4 hrs then have to deal with no seating playing musical chairs between the hardwood kitchen chairs and couch  i ll steal 30 min on the couch when i can to get my feet up   after 3 days go home my feet and ankles swollen christmas week long visit started to turn colors because the only seating with about 9 adults around was my sport lawn chair i brought with me because they only have a couch and kitchen available  there is a recliner but it s mom s snag it when she s in bed    tell you what i loved going for christmas to see my sick ma but i paid for that no seating bs even on a 3 day run then ask me why i bring my lawn chair hahaha are you kidding me my issues are KNOWN smh all i got for you for advice is ibuprofen get up out of car often and hold on for the ride it sucks  Back when my pain was real bad I would drive for 45 minutes and take a 15 minute break to stand and or walk around or even lay flat I also used to have a  butt pillow   basically a soft cushion to help softened my well ass It helped a lot because I used to have sciatica and could not sit more than 30 minutes  Yeah I used to love going on trips but now I avoid it like the plague I just moved back to my hometown Before that  it was a 5 hour drive  often took 6 5  to visit my family and it was pure hell most of the time Sometimes though  it wouldn t be so bad I d wake up the next day ok or better than I expected I would take it at your own pace  Stop frequently Medicate If you can tolerate nsaids  maybe try those because they reduce some of the inflammation I used lidocaine patches too Make sure you pack all the pillows tens  meds that you ll need to recover   Last week  my friend asked me to drive her 4 hours to a doctor appointment I asked if she was going to stay the night there and she said we could if I needed to I still haven t answered her because of this very thing I feel like an asshole because i have the time available  but i don t want to be in unnecessary pain and I m selfish I guess Either way you never know how you re going end up at the end of the trip  just make sure you have what you need to be comfortable Disposable back heat wraps really help me  L3 L4 incomplete with rods etc  with long rides  Stretching every 60 90 minutes is great if you can ask the driver to stop  Other than that muscle relaxers might help      Alternating cold and heat treatment for 15 minutes at a time when you get to your destination for a while can help too   Staying within the rules of your post I will not ask about the vehicle in question only suggest if it s a car the back seat by yourself has more room to semi lay flat might help  Thank you for saying that I m going to ask my pain doctor near the end of the month what he recommends for this

that that s crazy  teamzach    Check it outCalling bullshit on the  200 part mine isn t full standing like that and cost me over 3k Other than that it looks good Would love this for my husband If it s made in India for people in India than that price probably makes sense Please help me understand An incomplete injury means that the ability of the spinal cord to convey messages to or from the brain is not completely lost Additionally some sensation  even if it s faint  and movement is possible below the level of injury   A complete injury is indicated by a total lack of sensory and motor function below the level of injury    https   www christopherreeve org living with paralysis newly paralyzed how is an sci defined and what is a complete vs incomplete injury https   asia spinalinjury org wp content uploads 2016 02 International_Stds_Diagram_Worksheet pdf    Actually imagine what to expect before I see the individual   Well the ASIA scalle doesn t tell everything as it uses muscle strength as a grade for motor function but there may be other motor symptoms present  spasticity tremor etc    And different causes for the injury create different patterns of symptoms Many but not all SCIs are due to trauma some are due to tumors or cysts etc  The ASIA scale by way of a physical exam attempts to evaluate two elements of an individual s SCI  level of injury  and  completeness   It conducted in a very technical and precise manner in order to be reliable for clinical and research purposes   The  level of injury  is basically how low on the body  or really the spinal cord  the injury is It is the lowest  normal  level where there is no spinal cord injury So a C5 injury would at the 5th cervical vertebral level T12 would be in your thoracic spinal cord at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebral level As you move down the spinal cord you gain more functional areas of the body   The ASIA grade  A B C D or E  reflects level of completeness In fact it s redundant to say ASIA B incomplete as it s already reflected more precisely in the  B    There are very technical guidelines for these but for gestalt purposes   ASIA A  Motor and Sensory Complete  No motor or sensory bypassing the level of the injury  ASIA B  Sensory Incomplete  Sensation bypassing the level but not motor  ASIA C  Motor Incomplete  The scale that the ASIA developed from classified these as motor incomplete  functionally useless   essentially it was proposed that those of ASIA C would not be able to walk  ASIA D  Motor Incomplete  This came from  functionally useful  and the thought that those with ASIA D would be able to walk   ASIA E  Person with Spinal Cord Injury but no deficits on ASIA exam  they ve returned to normal or have deficits in other domains   This is just a rough description It s possible to be a C4 ASIA A and walk with without assistive devices at all with essentially full use of your arms So keep in mind this exam isn t the end all   Don t feel too bad I have residents who will be specialists in SCI who have difficulty getting the ASIA at first  Awesome Thank you for sharing Ok hmm good to know Thank you for this worksheet You re awesome This will def help with my studies I am sorry but can you explain how a C level ASiA A can walk I am a T8 ASIA A and my ability to walk is on par with my ability to fly Thank you for explaining this to me No wonder I was getting confused Oh Now I understand Thank you for making it click The advances in assistive devices are amazing It s so wonderful to see the options out there And it s great you point out that s not

below the waist is that nerve damageWe are not doctors Please seek medical attention  Seek professional help In all possible areas  Do you have a spinal cord injury You need to be more specific as this is a subreddit for people with spinal cord injuries and I could give you a better opinion if I knew why you re using an indwelling catheter If I yanked it out like I was pulling a ripcord I m

soon  And getting sent or tagged in every SCI treatment article People don t know what to say They re just trying to be nice but end up being annoying   Edit  I think half of them say this to make themselves feel better I d say the most frustrating thing aside from the physical aspects of the injury is the unwanted pity  23 years post injury this fall  One of the bad things is when one says  that must be terrible   because on one hand it is   lack of access dating life is tough no more hiking bike riding etc   but a lot of what is tough is caused by society and not my injury   On the other hand I am a tenured college professor with research and professional respect In spite of society s part in my lack of access I have a good career   I must say though I d take a shot at not being disabled by gambling on a fix as long as the treatment wouldn t make my ability worse  Yeah me too  It tends to remind me that most people see me as broken  After 20 years that gets old  When I was first injured it didn t bother me as much  But now that I ve had two decades to accept my life as is it s annoying to interact with others who obviously haven t accepted it like I have  Don t get me wrong if there s a cure I ll take it blah blah blah    What I find quite interesting is that people who talk to us about curing our conditions don t really have any clue about the kinds of intense emotions that kind of talk can dredge up in some of us  It s like  Hey you know that most painful and difficult thing in your life you deal with everyday that thing that cut you to your core killed your dreams and fundamentally changed how you see yourself  Well they ve fixed a fraction of that in an animal that s not even close to humans and human trials    which probably won t happen    are at least 10 years away  So you know don t give up hope  finger guns   I m sure I can take my fusion powered fully autonomous flying car to the treatment center then  hardest part of rehab for me was not having family and friends accept reality  As far as I can see a real cure will involve crazy molecular biologic wizardry by somehow re growing tons of nerve cells and making them assume the connections that were lost   Curing cancer sounds easy compared to that Curing cancer can be done by destroying every single cancer cell in the body while leaving the rest alive No reconstruction of anything is necessary  Upvote for Caterpillar Toenails    My pet peeve is that when I meet someone She wants to  fix me  and wants to drag me to some doctor that she knows Every Damn Time  My Dad tells me this He sees I m down and only wants to fix it I m not holding my breath though until one of these trials looks past the medical pump I ve had installed  My advice   get busy livin  The  cure could be decades off still  I hope there s a cure soon My trial I was in basically bumped my injury level down a couple levels real quick And it s still healing but I would say naturally now If that s even a thing What irks me is when people say how sorry they are about what happened to me  That bothers me And hearing that  oh this one guy I know was paralyzed but he recovered so I m sure you will too  shit really bothers me More like obnoxious these kinds of people   they need to STFU   Well they ve fixed a fraction of that in an animal that s not even close to humans  They can t fix a fresh clean SCI in an animal I am not getting my hopes up before they can repeatably demonstrate that they can  And in my case there s the tumor issue and the fact that part of my spinal cord never developed in the first place But when the understanding of nerve cell biology and the ability to manipulate cells on a molecular level has expanded enough to allow fixing SCIs I assume these will be minor additional issues  Diet and neuropathy pain and healthUnfortunately as you suggest neuropathic pain is a difficult problem For my patients that have failed the above treatments these would be some of my next options   Lyrica  Works by similar mechanism as gabapentin I ve had a few patients who have had surprising success switching between the two   Other antiepileptics  Topiramate and valproic acid can be helpful for some patients   Opioids  Although I recommend and try to minimize opioids as much as possible for some patients there are no other options Not all opioids are created equally for neuropathic pain The ones I would primarily prescribe are buprenorphine and tramadol and tapendatol Methadone also works well but I don t prescribe it   Tizanadine  and other muscle relaxants   muscle relaxants particularly tizanadine can really help some I ve found particularly if coexisting spasticity   Topical agents  Lidocaime and capsaicin Can be a good adjunctive treatment for some   Cognitive behavioral therapy  pain psychology  some will take this the wrong way but there is usually a psychological component to chronic pain Even if its learning how to cope with pain it could be helpful This is NOT saying it s all in your head   Big Guns  Intrathecal ziconotide and spinal cord stimulators  I ve seen life changing effects from these but invasive Would explore the above first  Try manual physical therapy  You will need a doctors script for this Neurontin made me exhausted all the time I would walk into the grocery store and be tired by the end of the first aisle I hope you find something that works for you My pain doctor says he would be a millionaire if he could find something that works for neuropathy  Seems to be a very common problem I would suggest going through the subreddit and looking up other posts about pain and see if there s any Solutions there I know so many people who are on a bunch of opiates but does nothing for neuro pain If you do find something that works though please post because you may help someone else  I am a T 6 Para x 29 years   I have severe Nocturnal Clonus which I manage with a combination of exercise FES bike stimulation and CBD products I recommend you try these before any more pharmaceuticals  Hospital boredomStand up comedy was my favorite entertainment What is your level I m c5 6 and I can game on my phone Currently playing call of duty mobile and it s pretty fun There s other games I m sure you can find one you can play Just keep trying  learn a new language or read books What are your interests before getting injured  PODCASTS since my injury podcasts have become huge in my life Audiobooks  Also you can PM if you want to chat to someone Watching anything on TV that comes on at a predictable time helped me when I had a 3 month stay  I would suggest getting a tablet Like a phone but better for gaming videos browsing the web And a blue tooth speaker imo Good sound is underappreciated lol If you are going to be in bed most of the time a exercise band would be good You can tie it to the bed frame and do many different exercises  If you have an Android device or even better a tablet I ll send you links for apps that I use to help keep you occupied while you wait PM me anytime  Maybe you can listen to some classical music my favourite piece is the Chopin ballade no 1 very beautiful  There is a great app for your phone called Pod Kicker and another called Player FM They are both podcast aggregator apps You can browse what s popular or search specific names or topics Then if you want it can reccomend other similar podcasts I have a list of about 50 that I enjoy greatly Mostly science and history Dan Carlin is exceptional in his Hardcore History podcast Extremely long and detailed while not boring or riddled with numbers that lose all meaning quickly   If you would like any suggestions or a list of the podcasts I have found just let me know I can even share an email that has all of my podcast subscriptions on it and it will add them to yours  There are payed versions of both apps but the free versions are fine I hope this helps Good luck  For workouts  what level is your injury are you complete or incomplete and what function do you have  Have you tried audio books Or for learning stuff some of the crash course series on YouTube are interesting   Hospital is bloody dull hope you get to escape soon  Is there anything you want to learn more about Consider taking courses through Kahn academy  it s already been suggested but audible is great  I listened to so many hours of dungeons and dragon podcasts or audible  Also tried to learn another language with podcasts but I m not the brightest and suck at English enough already on its own Any interest in

wish I new where ya are  I definitely love stand up comedy I am C4 level I have some games I even tried yet but I think if I set my phone up in landscape mode I can give it a go Angry Birds Plants vs Zombies Fallout vault etcetera I tried Duolingo for languages but I thought it was crap Before my injury my hobbies were martial arts climbing and triathlons so no luck there lol I also like writing

doThank you very much I ll send you a PMI am C4 incomplete I m able to use my upper back shoulders and biceps recently I ve been practicing leaning forward and backwards and I have some control  The only problem with that is I need some supervision because if I go too far I get stuck laying in my lap lol hospital is awful   somewhat luckily for me I was in a coma and have a brain injury so I was

ago I have the Witcher last wish The Hobbit and a few other fantasy and neurological books to look into I think the hardest part about audiobooks is some narrators sucks so bad Thank you I will look into thatThank you for the recommendationI got those headphones they are the shit only annoying thing is with headphones hard to put on and off as a quad unless you have good range and a bit of strength in the wristsDefinitely I just managed to secure some transitional accommodation so I have been out of hospital for a week now Sleep and privacy was the biggest reason to get out Still trying to find ways to stay active as it s quite boring still but I m getting there New South Wales AustraliaQuads with 24 hour care needsI have 2 live in carers but one is on at a time Each one works 10 days on then 10 days off  I also live with my parents which helps when carers need to have a night off or go home early  I have between 4 6 care givers at any given time All of them stay at least 24hr shifts One care giver lives out of town quite far so she does 4 5 days at a time 2x a month Then I have two three that do 2 3 days each week Then I have one that does one day a week and another that can do like one or two a month   Since no one works for very long chunks and usually have a number of free days between their shifts then burnout is minimized   I tried to keep things fair and not have one person always working weekends  unless it s what they want  And I make the schedule out for a month so everyone knows when they re supposed to be here  Interesting set up  when they are working 10 days on what are their shifts Do you require overnight care as well Walking woodworkerLife Changing Power of the Lateral Rotating Mattress   no more pressure sores  I m glad this mattress seems to be working for your family  As for as not wrapping your head around why professionals don t recommend them more often  my understanding is that research does not support that these mattresses replace the need for a caregiver to turn the user at regular intervals I would be happy to read any research  not sponsored by a mattress manufacturer  that suggests otherwise  Without the research it would be very difficult to justify purchase to an external payor source  The situations in which I have heard them being paid for were when the caregiver physically needed assistance for turning the user  that is the caregiver needed an extra bit of help that a top sheet wouldn t be able to provide  Disclaimer  I don t provide mattresses but my colleagues do  Here is a lower cost alternative that varies the pressure throughout the night Less than  100 and quite helpful to me   Med Aire Mattress Pad System with Alternating Pressure Pump by Drive Medical  https   thewheeledwonder wordpress com 2018 05 05 great product med aire mattress pad system with alternating pressure pump by drive medical  I ve dealt with SCI for 14 years due to a tumor removal Do we have any other campers in the group I was an avid backpacker hiker and climber before I had a climbing accident December of 2018 I m an L1 incomplete para who can walk with lofstrand crutches   I ve gotten back to Climbing and now climb at my gym 2  times per week and I ve gone on a few outdoor climbing trips with an amazing adaptive climbing group called Paradox Sports But I m hoping to start hiking and camping on my own more this year once it warms up now that I m further out from my injury and have had more recovery   What s your injury level presentation like Have you done much camping post injury  I used to be a huge backpacker hiker camping all sorts of outdoors stuff but unfortunately im a t8 complete para So I have no way to walk and I ve yet to find a way to take a wheelchair on a trail or find a way to camp without an rv or something  Not exactly camping but we did some bush walk trails recently with my partner who s a T4 complete para That was a challenge Came across some stairs and he was game enough to want to wheelbarrow his way up the stairs   as in get out of the chair and climb up facing down using his hands while I held his legs  This is what I miss the most Backpacking hiking and camping It s amazing that accessible trails and campsites exist but they are too manicured for my liking Being out in nature and confined to a neatly paved trail makes the experience worse for me Plus all the equipment and supplies needed for me to camp somewhere is ridiculous The hassle is not worth it   Take an extra breath of fresh air for both of us next time you re out there  I want to go camping so bad I haven t been since I could walk  I m 4 years out  My problem rn is that I live in Florida and I m in college so my only free time to go is summer and it gets way too hot for camping I m also a little nervous about my bowel program when I go but I haven t put much thought into planning a trip yet  I m an SCI walker no chair My tumor was removed between T11 and L1 Two years later I had to have an AV Spinal Fistula repaired Took me 2 years to get away from a walker and a cane That was back in 2006 I ve been doing this type of camping for the last 4 years I ve camped all my life You can go see what I do and how I walk over at Half Pace Outdoors on YouTube I do a lot of camping lolHey go check this girls channel out she has some useful info for people in a wheel chair She can probably help you more than I could   https   www youtube com channel UCDsUIsIjWQnjYcwf4eWdm QHey at least you guys are getting out there  ALONEGo out Meet people Go to pubs bars Join Meet ups Lots of people willing to overlook the chair  Luckily my important friends stayed around after my fall I m not very social but get just enough to not feel totally isolated There s something about old friends that livens up your soul   May not be relatable to your situation but is there an old best friend you can reach out to Someone you may believe is gone forever but you guys had shared times together that you still think about They may be closer than you think and wonder how you re doing Sometimes a call or text is all it takes   Good luck man 30 years is beyond respectable living like this  I am a T 6 Para x 29 years and managed to stay 100  independent while raising a family and holding down a career It is hard to be social with SCI because we are treated differently and the injury aftermath shapes our personality into a different being   who has time for socializing when you are constantly in survival mode   But your mental health is at stake  What I recommend is that you get involved with Adaptive Sports such as hand cycling It can be a very social experience and many communities have organized cycling groups and events Also basketball and rugby and snow skiing Even ATV off roading clubs Find your nearest Adaptive Sports chapter and reach out Your health and wellness is also a huge side benefit  I met my partner on good old bumble He s t1 incomplete  For some people they won t be able to see past it but I m sure many will Never phased me I guess maybe try some new things we go clay pigeon shooting together He met a lot of people there  I thank you for your responce   we are both t 6 i would reall y like to talk about other things two Hi there   Your post brings a tear to my eye My boyfriend is a T10 Incomplete and uses a manual chair Him and I have been together for three years He wasn t initially in a chair when I met him Had a blood clot on his spine due to Mrsa ANYWAYS He is the most handsome man I have ever seen even in the chair I don t notice it Other people might but who gives a damn You shouldn t let your fear of people only seeing your chair hold you back This injury has been horrible but the one thing I can say is it really shows you who s with you and who s not   Cheers  I hope you re feeling alright Glad to talk with you I was able to find some info on the interwebs This is an example of some activities available out there https   www friendshipcircle org blog 2013 02 12 the three most amazing adaptive sports centers in the u s    I m going to PM you some other stuff    Hey I am positive you will meet someone if you didn t just yet  My biyfriend is T6 T10 complete and I knew him way before his accident and after 6 years being by his side and he being by my side we finally realised that there is something more than friendship The chair is just a piece of equipment and it is overseen by a lot of people we know    So don t be afraid to speak to women use dating apps maybe call some old friends that might be more than happy to see you    You never know what might happen when you reach out    Hi Weaver I came across your post and I wanted to share with you There are many other places you can go besides a bar and definitely meet new people Check out your community resources in your town See if they have some sort of a website and it should have local activities Many places host free events classes Also check your local senior center You may not be old enough to join but they might have information to help you as well or at least point you in the right direction Use Google to find recreation centers near you If you don t mind sharing your city I wouldn t mind doing a quick search to see if I can find something I work in the medical field and I really enjoy helping people expand their horizons I think it would be great for you to get out and about I have a lot of respect for you getting along all this time on your own You are awesome And I m proud of you Now get out there and do your thing    thank ya for the last comment I m half tempted to go pick up a drunk but that only lasts a night or two and even though I am lookin for a female I am not particularly lookin for sex I wouldn t say no to it but i don t get anything out of it just work WHAT IS good old bumble I want to meet new people but don t know where to go besides a bar  I don t like alcohol and I haven t met a single female in my 30yrs  I need to talk to a female voice  are there any single females in americaHey just got over a bad couple of months  I thank ya for your response and any input ya can provide  a little help in any way is a good social practice For those with stiffnessI can t tell you enough how important it is to get a decent range of motion I fucked myself up permanently by just not moving and now I have contractures in my knees and hips and one finger for some god awful reason   I m on a shit ton of baclofen to alleviate my spasms  I take oral baclofen now and I recommend that you at least try it for a week or two to see if it changes your life It does have a sedative effect but it s minor compared to the other stuff I m on If you find that it makes a terrific positive change in your life but the side effects are too much a baclofen pump delivers micrograms instead of milligrams  Great tip Any recommended stretches  I ve just started really stretching beyond my PT stretches  similar to how I would have done sitting stretches pre paraplegia  and it has been a game changer I kept feeling this god awful tightness whenever I moved Now I stretch for at least 20 minutes a day  not gone but better Every small thing helps  Be careful stretching if you have osteoporosis or osteopenia I broke my femur stretching my right leg over my left Can t cross my legs to put on shoes either  Stretching really helps especially after a shower I also use a massage gun and that thing really get the knots out  https   youtu be purCXL42UA0This I broke my femur by using the same movement I was taught in rehab Just after 15 years my bones couldn t take the stressMedotronic spinal cord stimulator I have one implanted in my sacrum to provide stimulation to my bladder Lumbar spinal cord damage has affected my ability to release urine I think I found a program and intensity that provides me with relief   deleted  I have had one for almost three years It did help with my leg pain but not very much If i had to do it again I would not get one  How long ago did you have it How long ago did you have it How does this work How do you program it Did you consider other makes The one being discussed with me is the Abbott BurstDR In addition to the routine battery replacement  surgery I presume  any lifespan discussion or possible occurrence failure at some point how about going through airport security or getting MRI s My docs are about 50 50 on whether this is a good route to go for me My neuro in particular isn t a fan of how implant healing scarring can go  but the trial seems like a reasonable route to go Happy for ya  on your own experience Hiya my partner has an L1 injury with bladder issues Are you saying this stimulation device helps you pee on your own What caused it to fail Really Why Need some advicePossibly Any change in the texture or color of your skin especially on a pressure point like your sacrum warrants a check by a medical professional If you ve had issues there before definitely get it checked out because the skin integrity is not normal there  In the meantime try to spend as much time offloading that s area as possible Hope it s nothing to worry about  GO GET IT CHECKED NOW I am currently in the hospital for 6 8 weeks with a butt wound   The main thing to check discoloring is if it blanches If you press on the color  usually red  it should turn white when you lift up then immediately back to red If it s consistently white and leathery I would imagine it s scar tissue from previous wounds But it s nothing to mess with either way get it checked immediately if you re concerned   I had a stage 4 right above my crack after getting out of the hospital I m sure you know but weekly debriding at the wound clinic and daily nurse visits to change bandages is something you definitely want to avoid Took 7 months to heal mine but the remaining tissue is still leathery and discolored Lighter than the surrounding tissue Good luck man Get it checked out Whenever I get worried about my old wound bed even if it feels irrational I go to Wound Care and have them look at it It could be old scar tissue or it could be something new  don t risk it  No one here can tell you for sure  it s definitely a good idea to have Dr look at it  Same thing happened to me except it got infected 4 months in and they had to cut a bunch out Took about 18 months to fully heal Sucked big timeCheck out these neat Waterproof trousers for wheelchair users Exercises and weight lossWe re always gonna have bellies unfortunately Without core abdomen muscles it will always pop out  especially when seated An abdominal binder helps a lot but I finally got sick of putting them on and making sure it wasn t fkn up my skin   A c5 injury should allow you to use a hand peddler with wraps if needed for cardio to burn calories And any weight lifting you can pull off will burn calories and drop weight It s hard to drop weight when 100  of your muscles work With only 25 30  of mine working it s so hard to drop weight but I m doing it   I ve tried to cut sugar heavy protein for skin health and only 1200 1500 calories if I m doing it right SCI is such a bitch If you eat wrong you can be consistently hungry and still gain weight Good luck dude Have you tried arm ergometer with wrist hooks I also recommend adaptive swimming Some areas have adaptive gyms associated with their spinal cord injury centers  Dang bro that s deep but I thought of that but just sucks for me because I ve never done anything before my accident so you got to actually do some crazy things as a adult I was only 15 16 and the fat ugly guy that made everybody laugh and looked more as a friend than a significant other and now I m 21 and only experience was a couple of pecks on the lips I know I probably sound like I m being weak or boo who we have it worse than others but we are all unique but I m picking up what you re putting down Oh okay I understand I use a electric wheelchair but I have a manual chair I can use it s just I don t think I would be strong enough to push myself up a hill but thank you for giving your time to help me out Thank you so much   by the way what s the best way to find a woman that would actually talk to me and maybe get more serious Thank you so much I really appreciate your help my accident was 4 years ago so is there anything else I need to know Thank you so much I ll research that I never heard of it beforeI don t have sci but getting out to a put or something  if you drink  with a group of friends always seems like a good idea Be yourself don t try to fake or force anything just for the sake of it  My partner is c5 6 complete last year my friend was working for him so I would sometimes meet them both in the pub and it just went from there  I found him attractive from the start though when I met him as I agreed I could help if my friend was ever off sick or anything like that  If you prefer online or anything your approach is up to you People are always going to be judgemental and or arseholes  Good luck    xOf course Even going for a push on level ground works my heart and cardio harder than the peddler All my best to you Keep me postedShit man I have no interest tbh I m complete so there is literally no motion or sensation below my nipples Luckily I lived like an asshole before my injury Had threesomes dated a wild stripper was in absolute love a couple times    Now it doesn t even hold an interest Got down with one of my wound care nurses  of all things  and it was only frustrating It gets your heart rate up but that s it for me Suckin tits and eatin a gorgeous woman straddling your paralyzed body only made me want to blow my brains out lol   Some people are good with it and think pleasing someone along with mental satisfaction is worth it but to me it s not I know what it s like to be someone s everything To know you satisfy them more than anyone on the planet can If someone falls into my lap and is good with my company then so be it But it s far from my list of priorities   My list is enjoying the day Good music good weed and food Got great at a few video games Exercise is more stimulating to me than what completes call  sex  Trying to get an old classic car I restored before my injury converted to hand controls is next   Sex and love is one of the greatest things on the planet But unfortunately my memories are far more satisfying than spinal injury  sex  lol So I m on to other shitCatheter bypassI would definitely see a doctor but you can take medication to stop bladder spasms which helps some people Tolterodine one of them  Spasms Suck  My husband has the same problem Something that helps with immediate relief is CBD He uses 1000mg full spectrum and a couple drops under the tongue usually gets them to subside after a minute or so It s not perfect and on really bad days it might not get rid of them completely but it s helpful  im a walking c 7 don t use a cane though   Two important things you need to do  1 Stretch Stretch Stretch and Stretch this will help you a lot with not only walking but also with spasms 2 Go to the gym and make it a lifestyle if you can get on the treadmill do if not then hop on a bike or use the Nustep  a lot of planet fitness has them  3 Look into getting botox in your legs 4 Smoke weed Maybe you could take more baclofen before going to bed  I m an incomplete c5 c6 and I take all my baclofen before bed I don t take as much as you  20mg a day  but my spasms amp up at night too  I take 30mg at 22 30   Get me through the night I m in the same boat with baclofen Trying to take 10 in the morning 10 at around 2 and 30 or 40 at night Was taking 20 three to four times a day but I get super drowsy I just can t find the perfect dosage schedule to balance the spasms and drowsiness  I am going for my 6th Botox treatment this week  it has helped me immensely  went from severe spasms contractures in all limbs and hips and barely able to ambulate to recovering like 75  motor functions and able to walk with crutches   C5 C6 Incomplete I personally use the cbd lotion my pain doctor uses It s  RX strength   I don t remember the actual dose  and guaranteed no thc so it won t pop a drug screen  some cbd has tiny amounts of thc in them Not enough for you to feel but enough to pop a test Be wary of that   I ll rub it on my legs and my partner helps by rubbing it into my back and arms I m c5 C6 incomplete too and your post pretty much described my spasms exactly Good luck If you find anything that helps a lot post it so we can try it too  I m T 6 and I have horrible spasms and nocturnal Clonus and started using CBD It worked so well I developed my own line of CBD products which my wife and I sell in our local store and on the Web I would definitely recommend trying CBD before Botox or a Baclofen pump  I ve had good results with CBD as wellHow does CBD work  Is that the same thing as pot I mean do you smoke it  I ve read people using it but I don t know anything about it Thanks The first two are normal parts of my routine now I do a good amount of stretching and working out I was extremely active before the accident and worked out quite a bit  I was one of those CrossFit superstars before the accident Haha   I am actually signed up to do a 5k in May and I m on the treadmill training for that It s definitely not pretty by any stretch but I m going to do it They give you an hour and 50 minutes to complete this 5k and right now I m on Pace for about an hour and 35 minutes so it will be interesting  Smoking weed is not in the cards for me but I will definitely get more information on Botox I don t know anything about that at all outside of people attempts to beautify themselves with it I see the doctor on Tuesday and I m going to ask about that I have wondered if it was a medication that you have to take the same dosage each time I definitely feel like I could use it more at night than I do during the day Don t know what I want to do with my life Just don t do what I did and isolate myself to depression gets so bad you can hardly fill out your own paper work at the doctors office Please take care of your body and MIND I suggest finding your passion whatever it may be and following it Forget salary forget purpose Just always know the real purpose if that you have a second chance and a different outlook on life than most people Use your strengths and say fuck the weaknesses Please dig deep stay strong and never give up Once you go down the rabbit hole of depression it will change you Stay strong Follow your heart Help others when you can Your lucky to be alive  C4 5 incomplete quad since 07   I d recommend looking for something that you can do or eventually do remotely and or online You would be surprised to find that you have or can learn skill sets that require zero mobility like public speaking writing etc that can be applied to many industries Take your time and try to engage with as many people as possible Sometimes what you re meant you do is something you ve never event thought about   I taught myself Photoshop basic web design online marketing etc and started off by turning a hobby into a business I m now completely online only and looking to continue learning and build up my skill stack  Accounting could be some good money though  I m a little biased but if you re interested in psychology have you considered going into counseling Your perspective could be very impactful  Do you like writing  develop a passion in something   really will help you in life I m 26 yo c6 7 accountant The money isn t bad the opportunity is there Solid job security It s not a super fun job but it s a good one You are still young and can always switch careers but having a bed to fall back on is better then the floor especially as a quad   Mate the one thing the injury does give is time Lots of it We live life in the slow lane for sure but that doesn t mean we cant enjoy the journey we make any less  Just take what ever feels right for now It s it doesn t work out fuck it You can always re train Loads of my mates did that anyway  This is very true  Isolation is comforting  I did the same  But know this  It s the path of the pussy     It s not a path to any happiness either before or after your accident so don t be seduced by the  comfort  in hiding  If it s painful and or stressful chances are you doing some right  There no courage without fear That being said  For the first few years take it easy on your selfYeah that s why i was thinking of choosing it lol I thought this as well If you can be fully present understand different theories and apply them and speak well you might be able to be effective as a therapist   I didn t have a passion going into school either so I just decided to go with psychology I got my Bachelors and I loved what I was learning so went on for a Masters and work as therapist now It s interesting  every day is something different the work is meaningful and can pay well   It s worth taking a couple psych classes and seeing how you feel about them Not really but Im trying to get more into it Best voice activated remote control for smart tvI use Logitech harmony plugged into Apple homekit using homebridge It s quite easy following online instructions if you know your way around coding Thanks for the suggestion Don t know my way around coding unfortunately but I can try to figure it out Spinal Cord Injury MD Available for QuestionsCan you talk about what if any advancements have been made in the area of sexual pleasure sensation for both male and female SCI patients complete and or incomplete  This is a pretty hot topic around here pun intended  If you can t really speak to any new studies or info what has been your experience with people you ve treated  Any tips tricks meds or things that we may not know about   While some many of us do experience sexual pleasure a lot of us guys and gals have difficulties with experiencing relief release satisfaction whatever you want to call it  Some of us also experience low libido and miss sex  I think any words of wisdom would be appreciated  Thank you  I appreciate your willingness to try to help  hi thank you so much for this my bf is a c3 5 incomplete and has made incredible gains  walking around the house can pick up some things and feed himself  he s still improving at 9months since injury but not as quickly as before I m wondering if by recovery plateauing if that means new gains  as in movements  or if it means all like he could stop improving his walk or his pinch won t get stronger I ve heard conflicting things and I m just so weary  I m having an issue with doctors not taking my sci seriously It s a incomplete to the L1 L4 Bladder bowel retention left leg drop foot bad lower limb atrophy poor gait Also ptsd depression form the accident that has made me very unable to work or even stay on task  I cry doing paper work in doctors offices because im overwhelmed  I was 16 2006 and now I m 30 I failed myself by never going to the doctors because of lack of insurance and now I can t even get disability because it seems like my primary or ppl in the ER do not get the severity of my issues I educated myself highly on my ailments and explain clearly I can t afford my carbs anymore if I don t get disability The hospital that treated me post wreck doesn t have my records anymore  2006 much have been only paper docs    Anyway I feel hopeless and I stay sick I m trying to get a lawyer to help with my claim but how will I ever find a doctor to understand and document my issues in the appropriate way for me to get at least medicade for my quality of life Idk what I m really asking but it s sad I have fallen through the medical systems cracks and live in pain until I waste away   Welcome in your experience long term what type of recovery have you seen I was almost completely paralyzed eleven months ago but now am some where between an ASIA c d I know everyone is different but have you seen any people improving multiple years later Thanks for being here  Hey I m a PT with a patient  L1 2 Incomplete ASIA maybe C or D 5 years post injury His biggest issues are neuropathic pain  constant  and LE swelling when he s in a dependent position We re working on getting him a chair that allows him to raise his legs but the pain is his biggest inhibitor He takes gaba and oxy but they barely control it He has tried Lyrica but it wasn t as effective This guy would be a candidate for walking if we could figure out a way to control the pain Any suggestions  Hi I m a T12 L1 incomplete injury It was from a car crash I m currently in a clinical trial where they put a spinal cord scaffolding on my spinal cord in the area of injury and cleared away dead tissue and debris from the swelling around my cord at less than 72 hours after my injury That was 3 years ago I have a million questions but I ll tell you about my recovery first   Most of my function and sensation came back early I went from being unable to move both legs to a weak kick in my legs a couple days after my surgery 6 months later I was walking with braces and locked legs and a walker about 30 feet My function comes back in bursts I hurt my tailbone 3 months ago and I got a burst of function back I went from walking an average of 65 feet to 150 feet with my right leg unlocked But with this burst came more sensation and pain I started getting hamstring spasms in my left leg that HURTS and none of my other myoclonic spasms hurt This one is an exaggerated spasm that feels like the tendons in the back of my knee are ripping and my butt is left just sore and fatigued I know it s a common problem for people with injuries like mine to have spasms It s just weird that it started right after I hurt my tailbone I also was finally able to ejaculate a month ago I ll find out in a week through MRI if I have a PCL and other ligaments and how the cartilage is in that knee because it s really bothering me and I ve been told there s something going on in that knee by PTs I m worried these spasms will affect any surgery I might need in the knee I also have osteopenia in my knee and just found that out a week ago I started taking calcium and vitamin D to try and stop the osteopenia and get it back to a more healthy level   I guess my question is why do regular doctors look at me like I m a normal patient I m going to a SCI doctor in a few weeks because I ve had doctors say I m constipated because I have to do a bowel program I ve had a doctor give me an emergency arterial doppler because my feet swell a little if they re down all day Doppler was normal BTW They just think I m a normal 30 year old when I m not Some of the things that are going on with me are normal paraplegic things  what i would like to know  has there been any advancements in treating cauda equada syndrome about 10 years ago i had emergency surgery to treat cauda equada to relieve pressure left with permanent damage yet ssdi is still reviewable every 3 years as if it isn t saddle numbness and altered sensation never went away and particular muscles just gone example  my right toes cant fan out can t sit with feet on floor or they painfully swell along with incontinence and bowl issues  yet no treatment other than the initial surgery and neurological meds is that all there is  are you  eg  a physiatrist neurologist I ve never heard of a  spinal cord injury MD   Hi I m 18 months post SC infection Left me aC4 incomplete quad  I ve done a tremendous amount of PT and gym work and now I can walk have regained most of my right arm hand function My bladder and bowel is still compromised as is sexual function Although I was able to get rid of the SPT tube My major problems now  besides pain   are spastic muscles in my back and legs My surgery was a cut from neck to lumbar so many muscles and fascia were cut I do stretches massage hot tubs and gym work but the spasticity stays rendering me very immobile and with poor balance I ve been taking 75 mg day of baclofen and 1200 mg day of gabapentin I have very little feeling below waist I d like to get the tightness out which is behind my knees making walking difficult Also like to reduce tightness in my back making mobility difficult Can you offer any further suggestions Thank you for being here for us   deleted  Wow thank you for doing this Can you shed some light on why  for male bladder management at least  there s not some sort of indwelling catheter like a Foley but which terminates before the exit of the urethra and can be open closed with a valve placed in the scrotum   My neurosurgeon told me about such a device but when I asked my urologist he was dumbfounded and said no such device exists It seems like a relatively simple approach  coming from someone with absolutely zero medical training lol   I m a c7 sci and suffer with autonomic dysreflexia I m a 22yo female do you think it would be possible for me to have a baby  What is the percentage of nontraumatic SCIs you see    Mine is due to a spinal cord tumor   Thank you for your input and it seem I m going about it the right way Of course I d love to be able to run jump climb ladders wait tables pet sit But the only reason I can walk is my will power and the fact it was incomplete fracture Instead of every mentioning disability benefits I usually give stories of how I was treated st past jobs and let go or hours cut because my mental break downs or physical incompatibles with jobs available in my area Even entrepreneurship was a bust and a business fell in my lap Really hard to get better when I can afford physical therapy without medical assistance financially It s a loop hole Ignorance is bliss and I wish I would have just stayed in the wheel chair because I have ran myself down trying to maintain a status quo with the world Thanks for taking the time to respond Hopefully my lawyer case worker and state funded income based therapist will find me something to do I ve been down a lot of paths to be better and  normal  and now I ve came out the darker side with mangled memories rage fits anxiety attacks Put a go pro on me for a year and job shadow me and they would see what it does to me It s not safe for me to work in public I have isolated myself and I can t stand people who complain and have great quality of life  When I became injured as a C5 I was told that testosterone levels drop after SCI Is this true And why would SCI affect testosterone   Edit  A few years ago at  15 years post injury mine was still top 15  of the population  even ignoring SCI  so I assume mine was unaffected  Hi there I did my dissertation on animal models of sexual function after SCI and am moving on to pre clinical and clinical research for my career I m not an MD but I would love to talk with you about the current research in this area My expertise is specifically in erectile function but I am pretty knowledgeable on sexual and bladder function after SCI as a whole Yes this so much I am barely hanging on dealing with the poly trauma as it is My sexual function being completely gone is galling me If he has some movement in that area for example some pinch my personal experience with patients has shown that there is room to continue to strengthen it and improve those functions It becomes increasingly difficult though to gain new function and further recovery can be as you mentioned slow and frustrating I think your boyfriend s situation is a time when the therapy he receives and the modalities they use can be critical Has he done robotics for walking I m sorry you re going through all this  It can be difficult on the physician side to give people with spinal cord injuries long term disability given the potential for many people to work My advice is to keep searching for doctors who understand spinal cord injuries   Also keep the focus on medical improvement because ultimately the goal is to get better I m not saying this is the case but many physicians won t want to help with the social security issue if they don t know you and it s the first thing you ask for coming through the door If they get to know you and your medical history and all the things you ve tried it might help them better understand your need for social services   I also recommend getting a case manager or social worker to help in addition to a lawyer There are things like potentially getting a consultive exam without your own physician being involved   I just mentioned this in another thread but I m a huge proponent of medicare for all We have the ability to make it happen next election cycle if we all do our part to advocate from both the physician and patient perspective The amount of waste in insurance and administration is staggering I m glad to hear you ve had some neurologic recovery In general most recovery happens early It would looks somewhat like an exponential curve with less recovery with time Most recovery happens by 6 months and plateaus at 9 months  but doesn t equal zero  Recovery in some can go to 2 years but is generally small After 2 years one is as likely to get better or get worse   Three huge caveats  This is only neurologic recovery not functional recovery  There are individuals who have had late   5 year  recovery Usually this is associated with some sort of new therapy or treatment    There is some very very exciting research being done and I m optimistic about a cure one dayMay I ask what between C   D is like Are you walking at all Oh also to answer your question yes I ve seen people with incomplete injuries make gains years later I have had great luck with lidocaine infusions for my neuropathic pain Well there s lots of medication options for neuropathic pain Topical treatments such as capsaicin and topical lidocaine can be effective for some but difficult if area of pain is diffuse From a therapy perspective have you tried desensitization techniques compression wrapping  good for edema and afferent input for pain  contrast baths etc Edema can cause discomfort and pain independently and also should be managed   Pharm wise there s also a lot of options Things to consider would be tcas snris tizanadine some opiates  tramadol methadone butrans  and other antiepileptic There s other treatments like intrathecal ziconotide but that s much further down the line   It s also important to rule out that nothing is causing his neuropathic pain like unregulated bowel and bladder or skin problems This is a great question and something I ve actually thought about You don t know how frustrating it is when a provider misses autonomic dysreflexia or acute abdomen in someone with SCI    I think there are two main reasons lack of training and lack of experience   In terms of lack of training unfortunately medical school and residency tends to be more focused on acute illnesses hospitalizations although this is starting to change   I think the larger issue is lack of experience Despite strong communities and advocacy groups SCI is relatively uncommon Keep in mind that only about 300 000 individuals in the US have an SCI Compare this to 5 6 million with tbi related disability or 1 million with MS It wouldn t be surprising if some doctors have NEVER seen a patient with a spinal cord injury or maybe 1 or 2 That makes it difficult to be comfortable and know about treating this unique population That s why I think it s important to see an SCi physician at least on occasion who sees people with SCI every day and knows how to treat them and what s  normal The difficulty with government and social services is one of the hardest parts of my job so I feel the frustration   As far as new treatments there hasn t been any overarching fixes to the actual damage to the cauda equina For the issues listed there may be other treatments depending on the specific issue For example sacral neuromodulation may help with certain bowel or bladder issues There is no one treatment unfortunately to regenerate the cauda equina Physiatrist with a fellowship in Spinal Cord Injury medicine SCI medicine is a fellowship that you can enter from any field but the vast majority likely 90   are PM R trained Abpmr org has more info on the field and you can search for providers in your area Congrats on the recovery you ve experienced thus far There are many other medications that can be considered My next steps would typically be tizanadine dantrium and occasionally a benzodiazepine Botox and intrathecal baclofen pumps can be life changing depending on the degree and the amount of muscles effected   A good aquatic therapist can do wonders and a robotics exoskeleton lokomat program can be helpful to restore normal gait pattern  although there would have to be a consideration of how much spasticity you have  I think in the future it will be a combination of treatments that will lead to a cure and less likely to be one golden treatment I described some of the potential treatments in another comment reply   Dr Boninger from Pitt really said it much better than I could ever say it at a speech at SCI2020 an SCI conference last year  https   videocast nih gov summary asp live 30194 bhcp 1  https   videocast nih gov summary asp live 30194 bhcp 1  His speech starts at around 8 45   The barriers in spinal cord injury research are the same barriers in all academic research From my perspective the biggest problem is the push to get publications grants is so strong in academic research that the publication grant becomes the ultimate outcome and the focus on actual clinical benefit to patients can get pushed aside It s counter intuitive but I think if the importance of publications was lower in the tenure process the research produced would be better Time constraints pressure for clinical production funding and the IRB all also limit me personally   Spinal cord injury is a difficult problem but in my heart I know it s not an impossible problem   I think what the SCI community can do is continue to make your voices heard  which you already do a great job of  If you haven t already I suggest trying to make it to a conference  ASIA or ASCIP are my recommendations  to learn about what s going on in the field and make your needs known Join a spinal cord injury patient association Keep the pressure on for meaningful research and not BS   Finally I think we need a rich donor to make a spinal cord injury prize Something like  100 million for any meaningful cure and the cure would be public domain free I think our field is ripe for a prize and it could help take pressure off researchers and persuade people from many domains to join in the cure search Hmm I haven t really thought about this question before I have seen in the past valved catheters on the outside but never something on the inside My concerns would be potential for occlusion of the catheter without it being able to be flushed ability to keep the catheter fixed in the right place and ease of retrieval I m also not sure that this would work anatomically Yes absolutely  although keep in mind I don t know your specific circumstances  My recommendation is to talk to knowledgable providers BEFORE you get pregnant so a plan is in place This generally means going to a medical center where the OB and the physiatrist work in concert together I m not going to lie there can be challenges both before during and after the birth of your child but many people with C7 injuries and a history of AD can have wonderful families I have a somewhat unique practice Probably about half of my SCI patients  I do some other neuro rehab as well  are nontraumatic Well we  or at least I  don t know Possible reasons include physical deconditioning inactivity increased fat and people with SCI frequently have concurrent TBI which effects the pituitary axis  sometimes missed  We also know that SCI effects areas of the brain not directly impacted directly by SCI Recent SCI trying to find out more Do you have any insurance What state are you in  if you don t mind  Power mobility with tilt is quiet expensive Sometimes you can find a used one or there are places where they are donated occasionally There are some other work arounds occasionally but somewhat depends on where you are located  I do not have any insurance I didn t at the time of the accident either I briefly had Medicaid for about 6 months until my eligibility status changed   I live in Florida and there is a company called Marc s mobility within a reasonable distance from my house but I can t believe how much those chairs go for I have a jazzy elite 14 that I managed to get for a fair price with new batteries It works great other than constantly needing to have the joystick cleaned because it ll start slowing down after a week or two because it becomes less sensitive T2 T3 incomplete how long after your accident did any sexual feeling return I had my injury  T11 L3 incomplete  at the end of February last year and while I have sensation it is similar to what u potatopeacock related I have Viagra and have used it a handful of times but it hasn t worked for me in any noticeable measure If anything I have found that exploring and diacovering what new sensations feel good and pursuing alternative approaches to sex outside of ejaculation  I m T12 L1 incomplete It s different for everybody I recently was able to finish and it s been 3 years I was able to feel pleasure from the beginning but I always ended up with blue balls I m glad I got over that Being incomplete means anything can happen at any time I tend to get bursts of things that come back always accompanied by pain I was in a clinical trial though which may have something to do with the bursts of things coming back My warning to you is take care of your entire body all the way down to your feet You re going to want them to be in the best condition if and when you start getting things back And you re going to want that pain level to be as low as possible  I m T1 T9 injury with the main part around T5 I can feel pleasure but u potatopeacock is right because I end up with blue balls a lot with my gf   But I usually can finish with physical stimulation and porn I feel through my hand so it is strange with a partner because I still feel stuff but it just isnt as intense  u cazem1234 I know I m one of the lucky ones I have no pain I take care of my body and exercise daily This includes stretching and exercising my legs by using a passive leg exerciser It s because our deep pressure nerves have more function than our light touch ones I m guessing it has something to do with deep pressure being more functional for survival Like bones breaking and things like that For me deep pressure or temperature sensation usually comes back first I was shot in the face what s your excuse Great article I like how you engaged your readers and your use of the strike through to add additional humor   Anyone else get excited to see people s real names  My husband was shot in his back and is an incomplete L2 paraplegic  on the 20th it ll be 3 years to the day  and hasn t been able to walk since    Welcome to my midlife crisis  got me  D Thank you for sharing Motivational writing needs this kind of silliness from time to time WWRD I was shot in my neck bullet still stuck in my spine can t walk   my hands are trash life sucks I can t figure this new life out but glad you got a story to inspire someone My dad s spinal cord injury happened just over a week ago and we are all coming to term with the changes and challenges wr are now facing Thank you for your article and the hope that he can have a  normal life  again   removed  Thanks for the feedback The whole writing process is still new to me so I m glad at least one person read it lol The strikethroughs are my actual thoughts and notes in my drafts I literally walk through life with an inner voice throughout the day that for that most part thankfully doesn t come out of my mouth lol I guess it s just my version of a directors cut I m truly sorry to hear of his injury If either of you need help this community is full of resources and a great place to find others facing their new reality I celebrate each anniversary of my accident as my bonus years It ll be 13 extra years that I ve had next month and I ve been thankful for each and every day since  SCI is a life changer but the opportunity to still be around and for you both to still see one another daily is a gift in itself I hope you realize that side of your journey as much as the side that hurts Thank you for your feedback Everyone s got a different journey through their challenges but I m doing my very best to make sure I have a little fun along the way  WWRDI just read through some of your previous posts and if no one has said it before I m telling you that you re amazing I can only imagine how hard it is for you to just type a response on Reddit yet you ve taken the time to help others with depression and SCI You ve likely made a difference in lives of those that have read your responses but weren t able to engage in the discussions   You are exactly the type of person that inspires me to be better on a daily basis I hope you keep contributing here because I know without a doubt that you re oblivious to the fact that you re making a huge difference just by lending your voice to those that aren t able to reply That s both admirable and humbling and I want you to know that you re appreciated It ll be a new normal but whatever that normal is is going to be what you as a family make of it   I wish you all the best moving forward You dislike an  edgy  title so your response is to reply with something incredibly heartless   Shit man if you don t like it just say soWhat in the actual fuck

when you re down the only thing left is up So hang in there Have you explored the resources of the  Christopher   Dana Reeve Foundation  https   www christopherreeve org  I highly recommend if not  no connection  just a fan for my own SCI reasons and have taught a thing or 2 to my own Dr  s  Not sure where you re located but I also hear wonderful things about  Craig Hospital  https   craighospital org  in Colorado  if I was closer I would go myself   12 years along myself C5 C6 fusion Horrible spasticity for which I take baclofen and tizanadine I also have terrible neurogenic pain for which I take gabapentin That sounds like what you re describing in your hands and feet   I also suffer from IBS but that s only after I consulted a GI  gastrointestinal  specialist and had a looksee with a camera and a biopsy to make sure I didn t have something going on where it shouldn t I think you should insist that some diagnostics be done to make sure you aren t suffering from some condition that s treatable    I m sorry you re suffering and not getting a satisfying response from your doctors Make sure you start with a good family doctor and insist on having them refer you to a neurologist that deals with SCI s and get you to a internist for your guts Don t put up with a pat on the head saying that there s nothing they can do They can always try to get you to someone that has more experience  Yeah actually sounds exactly like me but I ve only had those SAME exact symptoms for about 5 months now  Never had an MRI or PT just an xray and a script for 20 percoset and told to fuck off   I m considering HGH or two different healing peptides you should check them out   One is called BPC 157 The other is called TB 500  Best wishes    james  No one wants to do steroid shots or surgery  That seems odd even with my limited damage they always want me to spend 5k on shots or cut me open and fuse me    Try a sports medicine doctor tell him it s effecting your quality of life they should have some suggestion  Was it a traumatic injury and any concern for TBI at the time Many of your symptoms like they could be due to a TBI   Are you following at an SCI specialized center The numbness in your hands would not be consistent directly with a L1 injury unless you had another injury as well Did that start recently or at the time of your injury  Are you a manual wheelchair user   Feel free to PM and discuss privately  Does anyone else have this problem any advice   desperate for answers It s unlikely the problem is from your bladder spasms overpowering the Botox It s more likely the Botox is just not as effective after frequent use This is common with Botox over time and the fix is to go a year or maybe two without any Botox to let your body adjust Then after that Botox will be working again when administered   As far as medication you say you re maxed out Have you also tried crushing up some Oxybutynin and mixing it with sterile saline then injecting that solution into your bladder then let it soak for 5 10 minutes It can be a more direct method of getting the medication to the bladder muscles I ve never tried myself but the top neurogenic bladder urologist about 8 9 years ago suggested it to me for incontinence issues  I haven t done Botox or any bladder meds but I do acupuncture for my incontinence and it helps me tremendously Of course insurance rarely covers alternative medicine but if you re able you may consider trying that  Cystoplasty bladder augmentation helped me a huge amount Before that I was having regular botox and had tried a range of meds but nothing worked great and I leaked regularly Otherwise wear a convene and leg bag  you might have to go with an external catheter  Don t think this is a spasticity issue as more of an issue with a decrease in Botoxes effectiveness with continued use Oxybuntin also has not been effective for a lot of SCI patients and has the added negative cognitive components to it I would personally suggest stopping its use or switching to a newer type of the medication that is more effective and doesn t have the cognitive side effects Oxy is outdated and many doctors just prescribe it because that s what they ve always prescribed I m not sure of the name of the alternatives but I m sure there s some dudes who take it here that can chime in   How often are you cathing and how much urine are you getting when you Cath  Any cause of discomfort or pain can cause spasticity problems to get worse So for example if you re having more bowel issues constipation it can lead to worsening spasticity If the cause of your spasticity can t be definitively identified particularly if you re having any other new neurologic symptoms it may be worth getting a spine MRI to evaluate for syringomyelia or tethered cord   Also your body forms antibodies to botox over time  particularly if given too much or too frequently  One consideration is changing your botox to another form of botulinum toxin  I m almost 30 years post T 5 injury Unfortunately things can change for the worse over time including spasms I developed severe clonus in the last 5 years I have always had a pretty spastic bladder as well When I started taking CBD for my Clonus I did note also a significant decrease in bladder pressure  Definitely don t do this yourself before consulting a doctorInteresting thought about the oxybutynin I also didn t know your body could get used to Botox like that especially since we increased the dose by 50  with absolutely no effect I know you can form antibodies to Botox but in clinical studies that s pretty rare   3   so as of now I m assuming that s not the case  although of course it s a possibility  but it s seeming more likely now Can tell us more about this I don t have experience with acupuncture what is your experience How often do you get it done I ve read up on the bladder augmentation surgery and know that s a possibility but the procedure sounded very involved with a long recovery time and other issues so I wasn t really considering it What was your experience with bladder augmentation like Unfortunately those have never really worked for me always come off when I move a lot get an erection and it would take away my independence which I can t have happening right nowI go whenever I get the urge  however if I wait more than 3 5 minutes I ll leak  So it depends on fluid intake and how much I lay down but anywhere from 5 10 times a day and each time it s about 285 350 cc For my job I ll be starting soon I have to dress nice every day and I really really can t afford to have an accident in the office Or even if I m in a situation where I can t pee within about 200 seconds I ll have an accident The anxiety and worrying caused by this incontinence really sucks   For the record I take 10 15mg Vesicare daily and 50mg of myrbetriq It s not syringomyelia and there are no unusual painful stimuli below my level of injury  just overall generalized increases in spasticity over time I also had heard that there are other forms of Botox but I didn t think any others were approved for use yet as they were still being tested and studied Do you know if they are approved for medical use yet Thanks for the response good to know I ll have to try CBD Experiencing receiving a chair through Medicaid Searching for a Adapted

incomplete also Took me 4 years and the right partner to make me cum Now I m cumming every night and though it s not like before  it s fun as fuck    Feel free to msg me  When you use a vibrator is it on the clitoris or the g spot  For me with a t 9 complete injury I find that I have much more success with the g spot especially during intercourse  If you re not sure where it is  it s about 3 5 inches in on the front top of the vaginal wall  towards your belly button  and is usually best stimulated with a slight  come here  curl of the fingers while moving in and out    For sex this can often mean that a shallow thrust of the penis can be more stimulating because then the head of the penis rubs against it  Perhaps you can try this with your partner  I mean I guess I m assuming they re male   Hey I m a male 9 months Post injury I noticed I could attain erections after my indwelling catheter was removed and replace with a suprapubic catheter So far I can only feel inside my urethra which doesn t do much for me but give me a sense of that area I ve yet been able to orgasm as it goes down quite often but I ve discovered that kissing and hugging and just being intimate has been massive for me I think if you find the right partner you can connect with emotionally and physically orgasms aren t all that important  Pumping feet manually question I m in a similar situation Try searching  lymphatic drainage  and add therapy techniques treatment or other similar term to find what you re looking for Lymphatic taping might help you as well     x200B   Let us know if you find an effective treatment I m just about ready to try anything to improve my swelling  I looked and found nothing concrete Really there probably wont be any literature or recommendations because it s a really atypical thing to isolate  People who can move do it by moving The muscular contractions work to continually move fluid People in our situation can elevate and let gravity do the work or wear compression stockings and let them prevent the accumulation in the first place     x200B   Take what i say here with a grain of salt I m no doctor  Massage of edematous areas works the same as all the others it moves fluid  It will work better in combination with any of the other techniques So in answer  How much and how often as often as you feel just don t squeeze hard enough to do any damage Or don t do it and wear some compressions Also some pedal edema isn t inherently damaging or dangerous so as long as it clears when you sleep each night and your skin stays healthy I personally wouldn t spend a lot of my time rubbing my feet  Look into a  passive leg exerciser   it is supposed to take care of the issues you have I have the same concerns and am ordering one later today  Do compression hose or a diuretic not help  Hi I m using compression stockings It s not fashion or sexy to wear but they work very well and avoid the risk of having a DVT  Amazon also sells a bunch of different  compression leg massager  contraptions that seem to work with air pressure No clue how well they work how risky they are to use but might be worth looking at  I m going to the University of Michigan Hospital in a couple weeks to see a SCI specialist I ll ask her about it when I m there But thanks for the lymphatic thing I saw that when I searched feet pumping for SCI but it mainly showed articles about breast milk  True My feet don t get bad and compression stockings irritate below the knees I only wear them while flying because that s the only time it gets real bad Sometimes my skin gets that crusty look on the outside and my skin basically molts but I haven t had any serious issues I do the massage and feet pumping when I think about it and am just watching TV It s just I want to do it more for circulation reasons But yeah a combination is what I m doing Pump and massage I m going to an SCI specialist in a couple weeks so I m probably going to ask her about it Diuretics are not good for dependent edema Causes electrolyte imbalances And compression hose dig into my skin and I can t feel it I only wear those when flying and take them off first chance I get I can feel just below the knee and those stockings hurt Either my blood flow has more willpower than the stockings or I m using them wrong When my legs wanna swell from flying they just dig into the stockings causing those lines and red areas and discoloration that I was warned to watch out for That s probably what I may end up using if they re safe for paraplegics It doesn t seem much different than what they put on me in the hospital People with SCI How do you figure out you have kidney stones or any internal pain without sensation Hi there 9 years post injury Even spinal cord injuries can mess with your sensation levels on the outer layers of your body we can still feel some sort of discomfort on the inside   Years ago I complained of lower back pain but nobody would believe me since I don t have sensation back there quote on quote Turned out they were bladder stones Similar to kidney stones just in a different organ   When you go to the bathroom  cath  you may see some discoloration or blood in your urine It could also make it difficult to cath if the stones go into your urethra Sweating spasms autonomic dysreflexia are also possible symptoms  I get an urinalysis and ultrasound done annually They ll show up as well as confirming kidney function My advice is having a urologist who works with other SCI patients  I didn t know I had kidney stones until I Cathed The pain just grew and grew and grew Luckily I was still in the hospital I screamed and a nurse came in and I said I had no idea what was going on but it hurt When the pee stopped I took the catheter out and there was a stone lodged in the eyelet I guess I m lucky because I was able to get it stuck in the eyelet and it probably offered my urethra some protection I didn t feel the stone in my ureter or kidney though It hurt like a bitch and it happened 2 more times in the hospital but those stones were small enough to go down the catheter  A few indicators iirc are leakage lower bladder capacity blood in urine Get an ultra sound done Those can spot the stones if you have any I ve been a C 4 C 5 for 17 years now I ve dealt with stones and had multiple surgeries over the years I m a quadriplegic with no sensation below my shoulders I get checked annually for them The most common are calcium stones because of my lack of movement In the past I would either get a temperature or become septic because of an infection caused by stones  something will be weird  you might get AD your legs might jump you might just sweat but your body will still give you signals It ll take unfortunately some trial and error before you re able to read your body s messages to you but a lot of people do figure it out eventually or get a good approximation  Positive changes in your community If you live in the US ADA isn t optional for new construction That s a very clear violation of the law and her civil rights  In Seattle you pick an avenue between First and Seventh Whichever one you pick is the one you re stuck on if you re in a chair  Oh trust me I know It s been interesting working on the civic level with ignorant architects Our community is small enough that lawsuits aren t common enough for these issues so I m working to fix the systemic problems at the municipal levels Long road ahead of usC4 5 Incomplete Quad since  07   I can only speak from my experience and share what helped me through the process I made peace with my injury and the possibility of never moving from my neck down the minute I was conscious and aware All I wanted in return was to see my family again It allowed me to move forward and appreciate every barrier I would overcome and any improvement became a bonus and a milestone that I could savor It is also likely the reason I ve never had bad dreams or suffered any PTSD   Hoping for the best is good and all but I urge you not to set unrealistic expectations And that goes for your uncle and everyone who is supporting him Preparing for the worst case scenario and being disappointed that it wasn t unnecessary in hindsight is a much better scenario to face   Independence is the first thing I missed and wanted to regain It s the first thing you realize that you ve taken for granted your entire life and your SCI will make you very aware of that The goal is to be as independent as possible within the parameters of your injury There s a fine line between helping someone with a SCI and taking away their independence Get used to asking if he needs help before jumping in It is frustrating feeling coddled and equally as bad feeling guilty or being a burden As he improves he will need less help As he regains his independence he will also regain his confidence and feel more whole again Encourage that and do not stand in his way both figuratively and literally  my dad literally still does this and I have to remind him to move ahead and that he s actually slowing me down lol    I was told that I had about 18 months post injury to get as much improvement back as possible I only had access to 3 months of rehab Scheduled PT times were good but I eventually went as often as I could outside of the scheduled times just to get stronger I volunteered for a SCI research study at my local University which indirectly gave me more PT and challenged my body further I signed up for outpatient rehab which gave me another couple of months but also proved valuable So I d encourage your uncle to dedicate as much time to getting stronger learning as many skills as possible to be more independent and for everyone to be supportive but mindful of his goals towards being self sufficient   I m an anomaly and incredibly blessed that my post injury recovery worked out better for me than for many other quads out there But I know that the steps I took also played a huge role in getting me to where I am today walking completely unassisted focusing on my health and traveling solo as a digital nomad The support I received and continue to receive from friends and family along my journey is amazing and I can already see from your post that your uncle already has that going for him as well Best of luck to him and your family on this journey  This road won t be easy and it won t be short But it sounds like you have a tight nit family that will help support one another There might be set backs and there might be times where progress is so slow you wonder if there has been any But keep your head up and know that you can always reach out on here and ask for advice or whatever you need Take care of yourself and Goodluck  First I m so sorry about your uncle and I think you re doing one of the best possible things you can   reaching out and looking for support I would encourage you to join the Discord server While the majority of the active users are individuals with spinal cord injuries  SCIs  I have no doubt you would be welcomed and that everyone would be happy to offer support  whether that just means listening or something like answering a specific question  There s also a  family and friends  channel within the Discord so you may also be able to find others in your position   What you your family and most importantly your uncle are going through right now in my opinion is one of the more difficult parts of a SCI I say that because immediately after an injury it s often impossible to know what things will look like long term Everyone has a million questions and sometimes the doctors in an effort to not offer false hope will say things that can seem really discouraging The best advice I think I can offer you at this particular stage is to keep in the back of your mind that whatever function or lack thereof you re seeing in your uncle right now can  and likely will  change How someone functions immediately after their injury isn t always the best indicator of how things will be long term   Obviously I can t speak to your uncle s situation specifically and even if I had all of the medical details in front of me I still wouldn t be able to give you very much information as far as6 months from now Every SCI is different and even two people with injuries at the same level can have vastly different levels of function   I m going to leave you with all that Again do consider joining the Discord even if all you ever do is just stay in the background and read what everyone else is saying No one knows what a SCI is like and how it can impact and change your life better than someone who has one And don t lose sight of the fact that this is a marathon not a sprint and what you see now is not an accurate representation of what things will be like after some time passes and especially once your uncle is medically stabilized and transfers into a rehab centre   Not really sure how helpful all of that was but just know you re not alone and neither is your uncle For me having the support system that I do including my friends and family has been so so helpful Hopefully you ll get some additional responses here from others as well   Hang in there Everything might be overwhelming right now but it will get easier Humans are incredibly adaptable and resilient and I m sure you ll see lots of evidence supporting that over the next little while  You came to the right place if you have any questions along the way don t be afraid to ask Stay strong Just remember that nothing is forever There were times during my recovery that I felt like my life was over but that passed Take every day as it comes   whatever is the norm for your uncle today won t be the norm in a couple weeks a month a year Things will get better even though it doesn t feel like it right now Your family is in my thoughts and prayers All I can say is while the situation can look bleak just no doctors still can t determine how much function can come back I have seen guys who are vegetables and eventually get finger movement and start to walk in a frame things are very possible you just need to keep a strong mindset because even if things don t come back what is the point in having a negative attitude anyway Kia Kaha stay strong What about sensation Can he feel anything below the waist 48hrs is still extremely early and a lot of strength function can come back in those first couple of months  Thank you for sharing this I am really happy to hear your story and I m glad you are at peace Thank you so muchThis was so encouraging to hear Thank you so so much Thank you so much These responses mean everything to meThank you Last time we checked he could only feel above the nipples But he has had one surgery ready and is scheduled for another so we won t really know the full extent until after he starts healing from those And it is comforting to know that there are still a lot of things to come Thank youHelp Sex with paralysed manUseful things to find out      how much sensation he has and where the  line  is so to speak    if he has has any nerve remapping   are his nipples now more sensitive Other erogenous areas     is he able to maintain an erection on his own Does he use viagra A vibrator     how much of his weight can he support on his legs Would it be helpful to have a foam wedge or extra pillows to put under your hips so he doesn t have to lean on your hips too much     Positions my partner and i have been able to maintain      him on top missionary  the wedge is super helpful     cowgirl reverse cowgirl    doggy but it s a bit more difficult because of spasticity and muscle tone loss    oral and manual sex nipple play   The key here is to be   very   open in your communication with him about what works and is enjoyable vs what isn t Be open to experimenting Don t feel bad  either of you   if something doesn t work the way you want it to  Another key thing is to not put any expectations on him to perform in specific ways I know you probably understand this already but SCI s cause symptoms that are not a reflection of you   For me I do have issues climaxing with a partner sex is a bit strange when you take out the male orgasm  blame the patriarchy  We spent a lot of time just getting an aerobic workout hehehe   I m just gonna echo the others just talk to him about it without any expectations   I m short so doggy is harder but yeah my partner and I have been working on finding ways for me to come and it is honestly pretty fun  You re not going to be able to get specific info unless you talk to him Open communication is the best thing here asking experimenting asking again Mutual respect for each other and the ability to keep it honest Humor also helps Also imagination If you re close enough to have those talks go for it  His neck and ears will likely be more sensitive so hit those areas up  I also date a para  T6  and go for nipples neck and riding   get a wedge  Also be open and ask him when the time for intimacy comes its much better be to upfront than to play the guessing game  Let me thank you for your effort I think it is fantastic that you are willing to do some  research  in how to please your partner   Best wishes for a successful rendezvous  getting naked with a guy is a great start   don t pressure yourself to be the best ever   likely your guy will have an erection issue   it isn t you and don t feel bad if the election department is hit or miss  i wasn t really good with any of the oral ED drugs and have never tried a pump ring or caverject   those might be perfect  just have fun don t let your expectations get to unrealistic communicate Maybe it could be as good for him cuddled up and you complete it manually But if you want a part in it I would think he could satisfy you facing each other side by side  Thank you so much This is very helpful    I wasn t aware there could be a loss in sensibility or a need for viagra Would definitely address this with him when I see him and ask wha he enjoys    I m a bit anxious how position changes will be I have  as mentioned in another comment  never been with a disabled man so I m kinda visualising him struggling to turn around and rearrange his legs How does it really work I m so sorry if this seems offensive to any of you i just don t know how it works and I want to be as prepared can be   I m excited as well I want him to feel great I see what you mean We ve spoken a little about sex hence why I know he s capable and that he could have doggy But he somehow seems bothers by people being noisy Like when we entered the sex topic he mentioned people asking him wether he could have sex or not and he felt like it was very invasive I didn t ask him back then I kinda just assumed he could so i dont know wether he needs viagra or anything Would it be best to ask him before getting in bed together or while in bed you reckon I have never been with a disabled person before so I honestly didn t even know sex could be an issue Noted Thank you Ways to increase spasticity I read about a study where they used lexapro an antidepressant to increase movement in SCI patients Apparently it increases spasticity There are obvious side affects to taking an antidepressant   Link  https   www google com amp s mobile reuters com article amp idUSTRE59H1A220091018    In my experience lots of caffeine increases my spasticity  That s a new one You could try a TENS unit If you do lemme know how it works  LSD or mushrooms  kek but serious  Read about some people who get spasms non stop when dosing If you want to get a workout and are open minded   not that I would condone it if its illegal in your area   but just thought I d share you never know  Interesting What caused your injury I was shot in the face   The resulting broken jaw broken neck and bruising from the impact of the bullet and possibly hitting my head on the ground lasted for weeks and left me a C4 5 incomplete quad   I was given no chance of ever walking again but with only about 2 weeks left into my 3 months of rehab a few key changes occurred and within months I was very blessed to be walking unassisted  I was nine at school   We had playgrounds this one for 3rd and 4th graders Someone decided  yeah three storeys high is fine for the tallest part of a children s playground    A different kid decided to jump off this barrier just as I was coming out from underneath playing tag I was flattened shattered my ribs and smacked my head straight into the ground   The other kid got up and ran off    deleted  I was accidentally shot in the back Was only a 22 but the bullet hit my t12 vertebrae It missed my spinal cord but the impact caused paralysis 6 months into my injury and I m walking on crutches with almost all muscle movement back Still a long way to go though  Ironically enough I also fell out of a tree approximately 20  feet straight down Only the reason I climbed mine was in an attempt to impress a girl Landed on my neck and got an incomplete fracture on C5 7  21st birthday got into a car  I wasn t driving  a little before 3 in the morning and some guy at an intersection didn t see the stop sign and just plowed into the car I was in C3 c4 incomplete and then maybe two and a half years ago started getting really unbalanced and they did an MRI turns out my c5 c6 started to compress   luckily I walk unassisted but with a severe limp  Early childhood  or congenital  spinal cord tumor It was kind enough to stop growing at a certain point so I just ended up with a lopsided and fairly incomplete C4ish injury  I had a seizure behind the wheel and apparently floored it into a retaining wall T12 L1 incomplete  surprised im the only motorcycle accident here i was driving automatic quads at work then hopped on a bike after to test drive went around a hair pin turn and confused the hand controls and was tossed into some big rocks t6 complete Was stopped at a red light and was slammed by a truck going 68 mph  I don t remember the accident at all and not much memory for about 2 weeks post  He supposedly fell asleep behind the wheel C5 C7 incomplete Accident was 7 months ago Although not the prettiest very fortunate to be walking unassisted but use a cane when out in public  I was a passenger in a Pontiac Trans Am   was ejected thru the glass T roof   found 50 ft from the car in the bushes I had fractured C 7 T 1 with a concussion   numerous lacerations  I was piloting a small plane that crashed on takeoff Me and the other pilot both got SCI s I was T12 L2 incomplete and can walk unassisted The other guy is the same level but was considered complete But he made so much progress though that they say he is now incomplete and he can now walk short distances with a walker  2nd day of my senior year I was going to school on my motorcycle I was going to turn right and the girl behind me didn t see me slow down She rear ended me caused a T12 L1 L2 compression burst fracture and it threw me off my bike I flew  40ft and landed in the middle of an intersection breaking my shoulder on impact   Then she has the gall to say that I fell off my bike despite the single tire mark and dent on her now broken front bumper and the fact that you don t get a compression fracture from falling off a bike It s been 3 years and I m still embroiled in a lawsuit that s going about as well as the Somme  I was in one of those plastic bubbles people bump into each other with Ran into someone and boom Couldn t move anything and it was difficult to breathe Talk about a freak accident Broke the anterior part of my C5 C4 C6 incomplete I walk with a cane and an afo Happened about 1 5 year ago Tried to suicide off the roof of my apartment building T11 L3 incomplete shattered my pelvis punctured lung broken ribs and sternum Surgeon said wheelchair with maybe limited sensation someday Ten months out and I can walk a little with a cane and an AFO  Mountain bike accident in British Columbia Clipped a rock funny and spun around so I went backwards in to a big cedar Wearing a backpack and the 4 inches of backpack meant my T10 and up stayed safe and my T11 down dislocated by 4 inches and crushed into little pieces on the tree Good friend said it sounded like a steak being slapped against a wall Spent an hour lying in the bushes with a close friend and my brother while my sister in law rode out to the trail head to guide search and rescue back 10 screws 2 rods complete spinal dissection and 7 weeks in hospital and here we are   Tada  Fell off a ladder Probably overreached or something as it was balanced on a balcony   Left arm was shattered bad collapsed lung ventilator and a lovely complete t8 Was in a coma for 3 weeks What a wild world to wake up to I was 4 and was riding my bike in our cul de sac our neighbour didn t see me and hit me I was the only kid to have a flying bicycle but it was only good for take off Landing made me T4 complete my parents bought another house before I came home from the hospital  I had a parchute that didn t work in the military in 2008 I became a lawn dart Can walk short distances with a cane 10  years later  Damn A physical therapist told me complete injuries were now pretty rare This thread supports this claim  I m so jealous of all you incompletes I could cry And I do sometimes  Not just because I m completely cashed for life but also most successful research studies are on incomplete injuries We completes are just totally screwed Zero hope for much of anything  Sigh   I was on an ATV I was probably traveling about walking speed making a turn The vehicle hit the terrain in a perfectly wrong way and it rolled throwing me to the ground T12 burst fracture  C 4 5 incomplete here I had a mountain bike crash It was the last run off the day and I clipped my front wheel on the landing of a jump My chin compressed into my chest and shattered C5 and nearly severing my spinal cord at C4   Luckily I had a few friends with me who were trained in wilderness rescue They knew what to do to support my while we waited for the parametics to find us    I m 6 years out now and can walk unassisted and am starting to get back into riding    After a long day of drinking and then a birthday party down by the water a buddy of mine told me three girls were going to skinny dipping with us so we picked up the keg and carried it to the end of the dock Had a beer on the dark took our clothes off and I dove in C6 complete quadriplegic but I ve got some feeling so I m not sure how accurate that is anymore   Three girls two guys I thought the odds are in my favor Not that night I did see some titties though  11 years ago this summer Fourth of July A cyst developed at T10 11 May 13th was a typical day woke up May 14th and couldn t walk  No feeling or control from the waist down on my left side minimal feeling and control on the right    Surgery removed most if it except what was attached to the dura  I walk with a walker still but can walk without it for a short distance  Everyday things get better  Came home Halloween 2010 guy had came in the back deck door and fallen asleep on our couch Neighbors had a party so we were nice about it woke him up said you got the wrong spot He s blacked out and starts screaming that we can t kick him out of his own house He drops my roommate another kid gets him on the front porch beating him bloody I pull that kid off and the intruder dives at us all 3 go through the balcony 23 feet up T12 L2 incomplete  I took a fall rock climbing and my last piece of protection popped out which sent me for a  30ft fall upside down and face first I landed on my forehead  helmet  on the slab below just as the rope came tight   The impact forced my head forward into my chest breaking C2 C3 and T4 7 I ended up with central cord syndrome C3 ASIA D Over the last 18 months I have almost fully recovered aside from some tingling persistent itching and some muscle weakness in my arms and shoulders  I was training for a rowing competition at the gym Popped a disc but was undiagnosed for 5 years No one did an MRI I lost my balance and some feeling in my left leg but as I was not in pain it somehow wasn t picked up  Five years later and I lost more ability to balance and walk and finally a specialist did an MRI I was in surgery the next week but because it was 5 yrs later the disc had calcified and rubbed into my spinal cord I was doing 10000 steps into the op and couldn t walk for 2 months after  I can walk very short distances with crutches and use a mobility scooter 7 yrs later and I ll still need a very very risky op to stop the disc cutting off my spinal cord Muscles are gradually atrophying away  I went to maybe 10 Dr s and specialists  I fell off a horse in 2016 Really dumb fall  wasn t jumping or bucked off or anything dramatic just lost my balance and bad landing from a decent speed I had a burst fracture L1 and chipped t12 too I am one of the lucky ones Stabilisation surgery was 100  success Just some bladder issues core stability issues and a screwed up sacral joint that s really unstable and being checked I rock a funky WWE style belt on bad days Over 3 years on and even though I am fortunate I can still walk my injury still affects every day of my life  Whitewater kayaking Flipped and hit a rock C4 C5 incomplete head injury and torn artery It was a complicated rescue I m 12 weeks in am walking and working on regaining my shoulders arms and hands   deleted  Mud wrestling   no that would be more interesting    ruptured blood vessels supplying cord causing c5 c6 incomplete injury    happened after during a trauma to head neck   currently rolling in a manual chair with tiny bits if sensation in left leg and a spot on my right butt cheek I have pinching grip but rest of fingers curled in   sigh Felt from a tree about 6 m high L1 incomplete So we have a lot in common   i landed right on my back though  Happened 9 months ago i m walking and could even run a bit   wishing you all the strenght what you need to reach your goals  Skiing Crashed into a fence T6 complete  Tarlov cysts and adhesive arachnoiditis from a selective dorsal rhizotomy at 4 years old I have spastic cerebral palsy and the 90s were a wild time in medicine    L1 S2 was the initial injury I don t have  yet as it can spread or cause syrinxes  any injury to the cord itself but my cauda equina is toast  Symptoms present since about 2006 diagnosed in March 2019 after presenting with cauda equina syndrome in ER in late November   I am  lucky  in that thus far most of it is neuropathy parathesia numbness pain Beginning to lose muscle power in my legs and feet I ve had  IBS  and urinary issues for a while now but no need to catheterize or have a bowel program as of yet   Essentially my ability to feel much of anything below my hip bones is iffy at best and moving feels like I m wearing high waisted cement pants In a wheelchair lying down most of the time  I think a lot of things led to my spinal cord being to the point it is but the main thing was I was in several car accidents as a child that I had whiplash in but as a kid I was always trying to protect the adults in my life so I d say I was fine   Another thing that probably did not help is I was in a relationship that was rather violent and around the last injury he caused the pain got worse I found out for about almost a decade I had been living with my cervical spine compressing my spinal cord I had signs I guess my limbs were getting progressively weaker but I had gained a lot of weight from meds so the clinic i was at basically said  lose weight then we ll investigate your pain  So it s a lot worse than it probably would have been if I had early intervention  I was out surfing and felt a lower pain in my back Didn t hit anything nothing happened Just felt a sorrness I was out in California celebrating my highschool graduation and suddenly lost all sensation and mobility from nipple line down  Surfers myelopathy  is what they call it I m now walking and even jogging a bit Bathroom stuff is a little tough as you all know But happy with how lucky I am You all inspire me still I will start college next fall as a 19 year old  Jumped over a couch c5 I was going down a hill and stopped on my snowboard Thei hill was small so I decided to turn around literally 200 yards to go home But for some reason I decided to creep down the hill and fell forward from a static position The boar whipped back and hit me in the head I heard a snap thought I broke my back got up moved my legs and 15 min later stiffened up in my lower It went away in a week and I never got it checked out to this day sexual function is hindered but I can walk run and do stuff so Im thankful other than the fact im alone single and a 38 year old virgin who is a good looking guy and feel trapped  I know I m late to the post but I m trying to get active here   I was walking home from work and a pickup truck veered off the side of the road and ran me over  Wow that s amazing How far out are you now from your injury May I ask how has this injury changed your perspective of life Hope you are in a better place my dude Hey personal question but is it true what they say did you regret doing it the second you went off the ledge   I hope you re doing good these daysDid you get the girl Glad your walking again were u wearing a seatbelt were u wearing a seatbelt Motorcycle accident here too rear ended by a 20 something year old driving her mommy s Merc Have you ridden since Similar  but I was stopped to make a left hand turn Dump truck rear ended me The guy was texting Got a  300 fine I m a t2 t3 incomplete Were u wearing a seatbelt He s definitely incompleteYou re the first person I ve  met  with similar SCI and walks unassisted Glad to hear how far your recovery went Was it from a mosquito bite There was a strange outbreak where I m from in OC with multiple people suffering SCIs28 and still single when everyone I know is married with kids Feeling a bit hopeless I don t really have any advice Just want you to know you re not alone You can get out there and start dating again Hopefully you can find someone like my husband I threaten to poop on him when he s being a turd   Kinda same boat almost 26 7 years post girl i love left this year after having wedding and baby plans  You are still young and you can walk Get cut get butt Get a good job and become stable to have a family not sure if you are male or female but there is always younger people to date so time is a small issue here go to new group events meet NEW people Church helped me with this this year I think alot of people can look around disabilities as long as everything else is still there  mind body soul  Also you are early into your injury things get easier and more routine learn to control more things body adapts  You re far from alone I m 32 and going through a divorce with my partner of 14 years   so I ll essentially be dating for the first time  ever  as well as the first time using a chair I have no idea what to expect All I know is that there are really good people in this world and almost everyone feels some kind of insecurity when it comes to dating  obviously dating with a SCI brings a whole other unique set of insecurities but everyone has their thing    I m seconding what Coffee said about joining the Discord It s one of the best things I ve done for my own mental health in the past 6 months It s full of a group of great people who all come from different places backgrounds and have different levels of injury It s not only a great resource but just a fun place to hang out  It s a tough dating world out there regardless but especially for us I m 35 F 7 years post injury divorced no kids  however do not ever want them   I have now been dating a perfectly wonderful man for over a year I hope I can offer some helpful advice  Also sounds you are a heterosexual female so going with that       Confidence confidence confidence  Much like women find in men men love a confident woman  I get that s hard Our bathroom habits mobility all things that make us  different  can really tear away at our esteem  Try your best to accept those things and not make it the focus of any anxieties     Be honest and open  From personal experience when I started dating I just kept all of my oddities to myself I hid the fact that sometimes I wet my pants I hid the fact that I have a colostomy bag I hid a lot of things trying to appear as normal as possible That only made things worse in the long run  Open communication honesty and sometimes the ugly truth can really be refreshing in a relationship  And trust me the right man won t care      Remember your SCI is not who you are If anything it proves you are a total badass Suffering a spinal cord injury but then continuing on with life just proves that you are incredible Do not ever forget that     You are not even 30 LOTS of years for babies Don t worry My sister had her first child at 40 Medicine has come a long way in terms of older women  which you aren t yet  having babies      Don t be scared of trying online dating I know there s horror stories But there s also a lot of success stories mine included I recommend using dating sites that require payment with use I know it sucks to pay to date but a lot of the free sites tend to bring the creeps Usually when people pay for sites they re more serious about a relationship On my profile I did not hide the fact that I m in a wheelchair I put up pictures of myself in the chair and I put it in my bio I made sure that it was not something I was hiding Still men would ask for a meet up and then bail because  I missed the wheelchair part   How I don t know   It sucks but as my friends say  your wheelchair is an asshole filter   And it really is   Long enough for now If you have questions or just want to chat feel free to message me It can feel lonely out there but no you aren t totally alone  Broke my neck 9 months ago separated from my wife 3 months ago I jumped on Tinder and now I have a girlfriend I am quadriplegic if I can do it anyone can You have no idea how much physical insecurities I have as well as mental but you have to try because someone will always care The only thing holding you back is yourself Happy to talk with you if you d like all the best  I m 29 and it s been about 1 5 year since my injury My partner and I broke up a few months after my accident I felt pathetic and unattractive with thoughts like  Who d want to be with me when they could be with someone  normal      I ended up downloading a few of the dating apps to see how people would react I was clear in my profile and in conversations about my disability Surprisingly people saw overcoming such a serious accident as an impressive feat   I began by treating dates like anything in OT something I knew how to do before that I have to learn to do again It was awkward and a little painful at first  dating is for anyone    After going on a few dates I realized most people didn t care too much about the disability If they do it s just not a good match It s gotten to the point where I can actually enjoy dates and I don t look at it as a difficult OT session anymore haha  At the core I think it s about being okay with the new you The more you accept and love yourself the more others will too Kinda corny but it s true I m 33 and a quadriplegic I had my accident when I was 15 I didn t date anyone in high school after my injury Felt unwanted by the world A year after starting college I met a girl dated and lived together for a year and then broke up because of abuse I didn t date again for a few years and the girl I did date didn t amount to anything However when I was 24 I met my wife and have been together ever since My advice is to put yourself out there be confident and don t settle  I recommend accepting the fact your not going to ever have children or have a relationship I m in the same boat but i m 38 and have sexual problems It s an emotional strain to think you can be normal like everyone else and have great orgasms and feel the love or a relationship Best way to cope is figure your a 5 3 man who desperately want s to be in the NBA basketball league but cant jump but a foot it will never happen  Your best bet is to refrain or get some kind of stimulation and donate sperm so you know your dna will continue onwards but avoid sex relationships and female contact all together even friends mostly because this will just feed the beast of anger  Id like to add i m very sorry for your condition bud and think you may find a life partner one day as a companion  Lol well you did get me to smile Thank you  I am actually a female but thank you for taking the time to respond Did the injury affect your sex drive Yes but for me I think it was more about injury   PTSD   antidepressants   lowered sex drive  Especially the antidepressants  Panax ginseng and maca root could help and look up  lingam massage    I practise qigong as well it helps a lot with blood flow  Yes I blamed PTSD But it didn t affect it long term Holy shit are you me Yes me for this entire post Feels like I m broken mentally Like I can have a relationship and you can have sex but it s almost like  Why  Yes 110  agree  I am not even a year out but there is just nothing happening for me down there I will sometimes get short lived erections but they are useless My gf met me after I was hurt and even though I try and talk to her about what does and doesn t feel good she sort of just attacks it like I was any other able bodied guy she has been with I am at a point now where the impotence and the pain and the depression have snowballed to the point that I do t want to keep living  There is an obvious disconnect from brain to penis because we no longer get hard from visual naked women or men if that s your pleasure I am 40 yrs post injury   in the first 20 yrs I easily got erections from any kind of physical stimulation When the erections died out my Dr prescribed testosterone   within a week the morning erections were back Testosterone levels fluctuate   are debatable having higher levels in the AM than late in the day   As for sexual desire   libido I supplement with Maca root for a few days when my other half is initiating sex and I have no interest Numerous studies have supported it s use for libido   even tho I was skeptical it does seem to work for me It will obviously never be as enjoyable as before your injury BUT some sex is always better than NO sex in my opinion  Yes Yes the injury removed all feeling from that region and also any thoughts or any form of arousal  That s called psychogenic erections it s a huge part of the sexual process and erections for everyone When you see or think erotic thoughts the message transmits thought the l 10 vertebrae and you get what is called tumenesense or something like that  I believe I damages my back there as well so that mechanism is subdued and I can feel my dick it s just it only works while watching porn and in no way do I get a boner from just looking at it Non injured people get about a 60  erection male or female from them mental stimulation and the rest is reflex through touch and it maintains so they sustain as long as they are aroused with messages and touch I get movement down there sometimes from though so the messages are getting through very slowly and the rest for me is touch but I never maintain a full erection because of the mental connection loop has been disconnected as you said  Did it return on its own or did medication or therapy help I m C6 too Were you athletic or have a high sex drive I always wondered if being an athlete meant I was more in tune with my body and just understood this stuff more than average How old were you when you got injured I m wondering if my feelings are skewed because I m comparing to a 16 year old boy What do you mean she attacks it Like she criticizes you   The erections will depend on a lot of the injury It can take some experimentation to find something that works Medication like viagra it a gel or an injection Also age is a factor I m incomplete quad When I was 17 after my injury I d get boners just from moving around after being stationary But I m 36 now and I get them much less frequently Mild ones from stimulation maybe once a day but the really good ones are maybe once every month or two these days Thanks I ve ordered some maca root We ll see Practical questions about Sex  M I feel like this stuff is so unique there s no way to truly know until you experiment   In general no I would not expect UTIs to be more common  intimate rider is definitely worth the price after three years of being together with my girlfriend we both felt tired of reason that she is always on top so i started searching for options and found intimate rider when we first tried it it was amazing for both of us i finally fu  ked her not her fu  ked me  D  p s im c5 complete I recently was able to finish for the first time It was on my own But for me I don t think I could ejaculate during intercourse Everyone is different though  If you are able to ejaculate and it comes out normally there shouldn t be any increased risk for a UTI However if you retrogradely ejaculate  cum goes back into your bladder instead of coming out of your penis  there is an increase in UTI risk  Always urinate after sex If you cath clean up first For me using a condom removes the sensation that I still have   For me being able to have an orgasm depends on a number of things How much pain I m in how tired I feel if I tire too much first etc Even if these are not an issue sometimes I can or can t for no apparant reason   I m not sure what the last question is asking  UTIs dropped my sperm counts drastically during after  I don t think Sex causes UTIs though  Those Including Digital Stimulation in Their Bowel Routine   How Do Painkillers Affect Your Reflex I ve been clean off painkillers for 2 years  3 5 yrs post injury  but when on them I took a daily dose of miralax and Metamucil It helped tremendously At max I was on 45mg day Hydrocodone and I had to stay consistent on the mix of miralax   Magnesium Citrate works great if you re blocked up for a long time like 5days to a week It s a regimen but sometimes the dragon   opioids  is necessary with an SCI Thanks for your thoughts Most of what you re talking about is not my problem thankfully I m just afraid of introducing a problem if painkillers are used before the care as it might be soon necessary As for calling the dragon the Dragon you are not wrong and I hope that tomorrow s conversation goes well with my suggestion   I appreciate you taking the time to reply Para kitesurfing seat frames Depends where you re from In Europe the only people I know from experience that make them is Tessier but i m sure there will be one or 2 other providers  Yeah it s gonna depend on where you are I googled some pictures and some of them look like skiing buckets attached to kitesurfing boards some look like the buckets for wakeboarding  UTI NonsenseI felt like I was gonna die until the C S results came back Got on the right antibiotics and felt like Superman What a wild situation we re living with SCIs Much love This bug would ve taken me out in the 40s Keflex tastes so nasty I can t stand the smell of it either  shudders  I have gotten plenty of UTIs in the past 3 years I hate them and the antibiotics Watch out for C Diff Take your probiotics and eat the right yogurt I do light and fit Greek yogurt every day along with cranberry juice as my Metamucil juice The orange and cranberry go well together even if it gets thick Make sure it s above 25  juice preferably 100   Anyone get yeasty with all the antibiotics Or your partner  Apple Cider Vinegar everyday keeps the bacteria away   God it s awful no doubt But it s working and for now and the holidays  it s a godsend   Imagine living this life w o antibiotics We d all be toast Cheers manThis is my first UTI in like 2 years  no   yeast over here yetDoes it really What do you do Just drink it Wheelchair mod to reinforce backrestI d ring ti lite

the first time  of three  and making some concerning sounds Rant on pity for SciI ll play devils advocate because I feel that s what this post needs    If free insurance and a free ride thru  university  is what you consider some success in life then this injury can definitely be a blessing Some consider true freedom and independence as success Some would consider this injury the worst thing that could happen to them outside of death or terminal cancer ALS  because it is And that s what makes SCI a sad situation   Those veterans you speak of have families too They have kids they want to run on the beach with Wives they want to dance with Parents that wish they had a full life of walking sensation and experiencing life as it was meant to be  Ya it s fucking sad SCI rips this freedom from so many people And we get that you re tough and can deal with any situation life hands you Give me my health insurance and tuition and I ll be great   But for so many that isn t the reality They lost their spouses their jobs their dreams And free catheters and tuition doesn t come close to replacing what they lost Go be a motivational speaker for people with hearts breaking wide open in rehab  after a fresh complete injury And tell them how it s ok cause they can go to school and not have to pay for doctor appts anymore Maybe sprinkle in some Jesus too Gtfoh   Most people able or not tend to not like being pitied so what you feel is understandable and normal When you run into the situation again dispell the misconception that living with an SCI dooms you 100  to a sad life Show them you are rocking on despite what life threw your way  I am happy that you are positive that you have braced your mind not to go negative I understand that he was a threat to that effort and mind control you practice That is cool  really     He was trying to be nice just let it go at that That is the positive thing to do   Wish you the best  Some people dont have your heat and determination pal your a warrior and champion pity is just empathy no worries Man that was such a great start to the comment and then boosh   Edit  Not sure why Im being downvoted I agreed with everything in the above comment except this part   Maybe sprinkle in some Jesus too Gtfoh       gtfoh   get the fuck out of here Completely unnecessary Whatever bro just trying to say there are worse things I know firsthand Some people get that easily and some don t I think this is my real problem The misconception that Sci dooms you Thank you but for me it s not even mind control It s real talk I just don t like people thinking I should be sad or miserable all the time Quadriplegic vlog exercise peddlar Bicycle motion moves your legs Incomplete spinal cord injurygreat video man keep it up gotta get me one of those  what if you wore shorts and put electro stim on your thighs or calves like the cheap ones on amazon  poor mans electro stim bike can you post a link for that thing Yeah I m saving up to get my husband this Everyone I talk to Recommends it Masturbation  What s your experience Here s mine I wish I had such luck two hits a few weeks back and it was enough to convince me no more tripping  avid tripper pre injury  after coming to from a long bad trip in a pool of my own pee I have a small amount of sensation in my penis It is different than pre injury and I have not been able to learn what will make me orgasm I have had a little success with weed making me horny but PiV sex with my girlfriend is off the table I feel bad that my lack of libido is forced upon her but I am trying to get better I think I might ask her to spend some time exciting what will work with my parts  So cool  I need to try this  How long does nerve pain last Mine got better but it happens on the order of years  Still there though   Things that help my nerve pain  heat especially Jacuzzi Movement Electrical stim like from a TENS unit CBD ointment  slight benefit  Massage  It s worse in the winter   Things that don t help  gabapentin Weed    though it helps with sleeping through it  Mine has never gone away but it has gotten less severe over the years  Mine hasn t gone away and my neurologist doesn t seem optimistic it will I have the same level of injury as you Mine has not gone away but it has decreased I also still have numbness in my foot 1 5 yrs post injury  C4 5 incomplete quad here 12 years post injury with burning skin aka 24 7 sunburn on both arms and hands It s never gone away but I ve learned or conditioned myself to ignore it by staying busy But I don t think they will ever go away    I was given Lyrica and oxys T3s etc out of rehab I slowly cut out oxys then T3s and cut down Lyrica from 300mg x 2 daily to just 150mg daily over the first 2 years And finally this year I quit cold turkey Worst few days of my life but I realized that there hasn t been a huge change in my pain but the bonus is that I m much more awake without pain meds   May try CBD once it s legally available worldwide as I don t want the hassle of getting into trouble while I m traveling but initial tests have shown that it is helpful So although the pain might never go away for us there s solutions that might be available in the near future including CBD and stem cells that we can look forward to  2 years in and no improvements  would suggest not staying on lyrica or gabepentin if they are not working  i made a poor choice staying on lyrica and having a tough time getting off it even though im fairly sure it s not helping me at all  Mine has gotten worse for 20 years  slowy gotten worse kinda an every 10 years it changes thing   Gabapentin used to work for me but now only if I take more than I am supposed to   Like 3600mg at least     Baclofen kinda works at 20mg doses but that is high dosage that Dr s don t like to do because of respiratory depression   Hoping yours decreases instead of turning into spasticity like mine did     SameAnyone dealt with Kaiser Kaiser is difficult but I ve never heard of them only treating people on medicare medicaid I would ask someone else at least 3 someone s actually It s cumbersome and you shouldn t have to be the one to do it but in my experience there are some terrifically ill informed people in the southern California Kaiser network and not a lot of communication between them   If somehow you can manage to switch to the Nor Cal Kaiser network it is a world of difference My mom was recently in KFRC and had no trouble being admitted without medicare medicaid  Do you have case manager or advocate If not get one  Yes we have one at Rancho I guess they won t let us know who the contact is at Kaiser until much closer to his release date  Okay Thanks for the insight A Christmas miracle  NSFW text T4 was about a year and half past injury Same story no toy just hand and couldn t stop smiling for the rest of the day  T4 complete  yes I ve been there Mine was a year after the injury It s difficult at first  like flying a plane blind or something After almost 9 years I can produce twice a week using hand stimulation and cialis  I m 31  Takes time and practice sometimes it takes me 10 min sometimes it takes me an hour Cool thing is orgasm reduces spasticity for me for pretty much the whole day So it s a nice natural muscle relaxer in my case   deleted   deleted  I m a L1 incomplete 31y o male and about 7 weeks since my accident I ve gotten some leg movement back but I m still waiting for any kind of sexual reawakening Thanks for the encouragement not to give up I m glad you finally got some release  My husband  50  c 6 7 since 1991   first ejaculating 10 years post accident and happily twice tonight says it helps to leave a little urine in your bladder   for some reason stimulates a non retrograde ejaculation  Good for you bro Stoked for you man I successfully came for the first time on Monday a little more than a year after my injury Granted I used a hitachi wand I m C5 incomplete so I got AD afterwards but it only lasted a couple minutes I had been feeling really down lately about not being able to I was so excited that I told the girl I went on a date with that night Big time overshare lol but she s a pt that works with sci patients so she understood  C4 5 incomplete quad Great to hear I felt your pain and joy It took me 29 months post injury I was so excited that I sent pics of my condom to all my closest friends  That s awesome man   My bf is T4 complete 3 5 years since acco He s managed to make it happen on his own before but it hasn t happened recently and I know it s been frustrating for him I d love to be able to help him do it Is there anything I could try to help him out  I m incomplete T4 and it took 8 years before I got the magic tingle and abdomen spasms No ejaculation   assume small retrograde action  but a belter of an AD headache and face flush Now 2 years later can get a weak ejaculation of cum and a much better orgasm but the AD is still brutal Spasticity reduction is great though much better way than all the bloody drugs I have to normally take   Keep trying as it s definitely worth it when you succeed    deleted  u cazem1234 It s like  holy shit My life has changed It really didn t take as much as I expected I guess people just need to keep trying until it happens The spasticity issue was the thing I was happiest about It can be so painful so now I can just tell everyone  sorry gotta go jack off for medical reasons  Only 6 months That s awesome I loved that story I m glad you re able to do it I m sure it s pretty similar to what a normal orgasm is maybe slightly dulled a bit But still pretty close Be glad you don t know what a normal orgasm felt like so you don t have anything to compare it to because this is the best we ve got or it will only get better until ED hits us And I m not worried about having kids There s ways they can make it happen in a lab or whatever and I m gay anyway But now I might be able to get a boyfriend since cum is a big deal in my community apparently Bunch of cum hungry whores out there If you don t mind my asking did you guys conceive naturally by just timing her getting on before you climax Hang in there Good job to yourself That s awesome I have the same injury as your boyfriend has he tried deathgripping his cock while wanking and jerking really fast I can t cum without it because I barely feel jack shit if I don t   Edit  Also lube or spit in a condom and put it on  I cannot stress how important lube is for me atleast Hi t4 complete 31 y o man here been in a chair since 21 I can almost guarantee an orgasm the morning of a hangover For some reason everything is hard and ready to go after heavy drinking nights I ve read somewhere it s my body producing excessive testosterone trying to recover from the alcohol   So that s me might be different for others I ve yet to find someone who could make me orgasm other than my own methods Speed is more important than grip in my opinion Go with what pm said I don t know how people with an SCI that high do it Just don t give up and try everything The pressure thing that pm said did help me feel it more because I think my deep pressure nerves work better than my light pressure nerves in that area The nerves are complicated and different for every injury That s actually my timeline kind of It took a year of trying to get to what I thought was an orgasm with nothing coming out Then 2 years of trying and now I can finally do it In my opinion the drugs they get us on for spasticity kills the ability to orgasm I cut out all pain meds and muscle relaxers because I hated the drowsiness and dependency Soon after the ability to orgasm regularly came I have daily pain and spasticity but knowing I can be a man when I need to  most times  is much more important to me I imagine it s different for everyone For me breathing still gets heavier and heavier My head feels odd  reminds me of when I would play hide and seek I would sprint to my spot and freeze That hot feeling that came right after and blood rush to the brain that s what I feel when I orgasm Oh and my legs spasm kick straight hard it s knocked a girl down before Embarrassing and funny        E  your questions  T4 complete I cannot feel my penis at all But there are certain signals that are hard to describe in my head that key me know something is happening down there  useful for accidentally sitting on dick  balls during transfer Have you tried the G spot  I m a T 9 complete female and that s what gets me there  I highly suggest trying it  I m actually going to post a recent and surprising masturbation experience in r sciwomen soon   Actually I have gotten some pretty good feeling from clitoral stimulation before but it literally takes at least 45 minutes of rapid consistent stimulation and intense fantasizing  Also Venus has to align with Mercury on a Tuesday when it s raining For me I can feel my penis some it s just dulled The orgasm doesn t feel the same to me it s different somehow like my brain isn t releasing the right chemicals but it still feels good I know some people with higher injuries have to watch out for autonomic dysreflexia which is like an increase in BP that can be bad Congratulations man that is amazing I can only wishThoughts of independenceThe good news is you can do a lot with one arm Having a job and earning a paycheck is still very possible The bad news is yes there s gonna be some major changes in your dad s life going forward and some of them are gonna suck   Depending on what stage he s in there s a good chance he ll get a lot of function back during rehab Tell him the first 1 2 years post injury are not time to slack off in an opioid induced dream state Some doctors will be happy to facilitate that and it s a trap that ll only make things worse Get him in to physical therapy and go balls out both at therapy and at home   As far as caretakers go it depends on the family situation If you have people who can spend their time helping you can avoid hiring help Most likely you ll need to hire someone at least for a while Be picky as hell Meet with them first to know what their experience is and don t hesitate to put cameras up in the house if you don t feel comfortable with them having unmonitored access  I m in a similar position   I need a caretaker every day   least to help get me washed    cleaned up Gd luck with everything How long has it been since his injury  Thanks for your reply we ve had no opioids after the first two weeks post surgery so unfortunately no induced dream states we re not in the US so not sure how differently prescribed drugs could be He s in physio and occupational therapy every day and going hell for leather while waiting to get into the national rehab centre My mother has a part time carer so we re well used to the system his main question is are carers going to be an everyday thing in his life and we re accepting that they probably will be have you got any experience as to how independent he could possibly get again thank you so much for your reply it s really appreciatedThanks for your reply are you able to get yourself in and out of bed It s been just under four monthsHow has your pet treated you post injury While my husband was doing inpatient rehab there was a therapy dog program The handler told us to take a shirt he d been wearing during PT  more pheromones released  and put it where she sleeps Apparently there meds you re now on make you smell different and may cause your dog to not recognize you and even become aggressive She was being crated at night while staying at my mom s so it stayed in the crate until we brought her home She was a little wary at first because of the electric wheelchair but she warmed up pretty fast Now she even tries to climb in the chair with him when she s super excited   I don t know if this helps but it might be worth a shot  My dog doesn t seem to understand We used to run and play in the park all the time and now I can t I also had to have him stay with a friend during the five months I was in the hospital and SNF Now I am effectively homeless and he is with another friend I dont think I am ever going to get him back  There are many options for your dog before euthenasia I really hope you explore as many avenues as possible before even considering putting your dog down I know it s an unpopular opinion but humans aren t out here putting other people down because they are have been aggressive  Could you rehome your pet  I didn t have a dog but a cat so take this with a grain of salt  My cat was freaked out when she first came into contact with my chair and took a few months to get used to me again  She hid under the couch when she first saw me   In my 20 years in a chair i have come into contact with a lot of animals  I have noticed that dogs have many varied reactions to the chair  Some are OK with it some don t seem fazed by it some are afraid of it and some hate it  I imagine that there could be many reasons why your dog is having this reaction  As someone else mentioned it could be a change in your smell  It could be that she s uncomfortable with how you move differently now  Or maybe she knows your mentality has changed  as it often does post SCI  and she senses this and doesn t know how to deal with it    Could it be that pre SCI your dog saw you as the  leader  and now there s been a shift in that dynamic  I don t know anything about you or how you ve dealt with your injury but many people feel depressed afterward  could this be affecting how your dog sees you   I agree with others that there are likely many other options to consider before euthanasia  At the very least please contact a local trainer SPCA or veterinarian and ask their advice  Any idea what your dog is reacting to Does she he seem wary when you re moving when there s food around just out of the blue or something else  Wow that s so upsetting I m so sorry I don t know if I have anything useful to say but if it was me I d talk to whoever I can who knows about dogs Her vet Has she had a trainer I guess this is a stressful time for everyone and she s picking up on that and stressed too I really hope it gets better for you all No judgment on you for whatever you decide  Get a new dog who loves you Byeee old dog to a shelter please tho  Hey I was kinda curious how it s going with the dog What kind of dog do you have Is she warming back up to you  My dog was wary at first and scared of the power chair but after a few times sitting on my lap realised who I was and went back to normal But she likes the manual chair better because it s less noisy and I rarely wear shoes and she often smells my feet  6 years later she plays with toys in front of me instead of dropping them at my feet I m sorry friend I hope things get better and you get him back It s a last resort for me but do I rehome an aggressive dog It s an option I want to look at but my wife feels if she attacked once she could again I know she is confused and it wasn t her normal behavior but I see my wife s point Out of the blue When I first came home she was wary of me but warmed up Now she avoids me at all costs It has turned out ok The dog has turned around and though I m a little Leary she is behaving We kept her and things are ok Corgi and yes she is If they  this research team  can repair the optic nerve  to 100   in the back of the eye surely other research team s  can apply the technique to a damaged spinal cord  Unfortunately the spinal cord isn t really identifiable Even under electron microscope the best terms we can come up with are  grey matter  and  white matter  We literally don t know what it is There s no routes or connections like peripheral nerves I try to remain optimistic on research but when we can rebuild the cord we can rebuild the brain and probably will be living forever at that point lol   There s no routes or connections like peripheral nerves   Well   there are Millions of them that is one of the problems A damaged peripheral nerve can regenerate along its myelin sheath but spinal cord nerve cells would have to find the right path among millions first Assuming that it hasn t scarred over and become inacessible and also assuming that the original nerve cell is still alive Actually there are lots of bundles of nerves that can be separated into different tracts that we know route to different parts of the brain Eg corticospinal Tract vestibulospinal Tract etc tricky part is reorganizing them into a way that promotes recoveryAnyone else in a clinical trial If so please explain what they did and how your progress has been Don t look if you re part of the research team of a SCI clinical trial I was part of a Schwann cell clinical trial 2 years ago at the university of Miami The took a nerve out of my leg to harvest the cells and injected them into my spinal cord where my injury occurred  c5 complete injury  So far I ve had no changes in sensation or function but the study was a phase 1 clinical trial where they were mainly assessing the safety of the transplant overall I lived in south Florida for a year to be in the study  I am still part of a drug trial in which I was given medication for reduction of inflammation post operation This was to see if it would help with increasing function quickly after operation The only way to find out if I had the placebo or not is to find out in a couple years when the trial is finished Considering how much function has come back I doubt it had much effect at all  I was a part of a therapeutic hypothermia trial the military ran for sci in 2007 I didn t have the cooling intravenously I was put on an ice table naked and once my core temperature dropped to 32C they would work on the spinal manipulations  3x a week  for 6 weeks right after my accident It was extremely painful and something I ll probably never forget However I eventually started walking again so I can t complain too much The more my legs hurt the more they respond On the days they don t hurt at all they don t respond Luckily most days they hurt     Edit  My wife said I should add that I m extremely sensitive to cold now Preferring to live somewhere where it gets 110  F  just so I don t have to deal with it  How old was your injury when they did this trial on you  I m a c5 c6 ASIA A  2 years out I m currently involved in a phase 1 trial with NSC injections one time surgery since it s a safety and efficacy trial I m about ten months post op starting to get little patches of sensation below my injury It s early yet but so far from speaking with other participants as well as reading the published results from the first group  thoracic level vs cervical  this treatment seems to be on par with the MSC treatment trials  hope for 1 2 levels of function return at best  There s no guarantee that this sensation will turn into any functional gains but I m lucky enough to be able to go to PT every day to try and aid in the reprogramming of my new neuronal pathways if they indeed exist  I have recently even seen some vestibular response in my quads while weight bearing which was incredibly rad but still no guarantee that anything voluntary will come from all this  I will say that my biggest take away from getting involved in this trial and my own research in SCI science is that there indeed are many interesting advancements and communities dedicated to solving SCI  I realize I am new to SCI and that the scientific community has been claiming a solution to be just out of their grasp for as long as SCI has been studied but I am confident that I will see accessible treatment options in my lifetime that will significantly change our quality of life Also the surgery sucked Maybe not as painful as detethering but the original laminectomy didn t seem as painful  perhaps because of scar tissue or pain meds didn t work as well this time but it f    ng hurt  Anybody else remember the lidocaine shot to prepare for drip tube removal  I was on so much morphine the first time I don t remember but that second time will be hard to forget  I m convinced that the only reason I regained what I did so quickly is because they drained the inflammation and dead tissue when they put the scaffolding on my spinal cord That s like a double edged sword I m glad that it worked but sucks that it hurts when it s working How do they manipulate it Oh it was fresh Within 72 hours I was pretty out of it for my laminectomy too But as soon as they had me sit up for the first time 3 days after surgery or whatever that was so painful I cried as soon as the PTs left the room I held the crying in til they left but I couldn t keep the scream in   I don t know what half of those acronyms mean but I m glad you seem to be getting something back Anything is good It sounds like you re positive about this I m hoping you get at least 2 levels back as well Hang in there in the meantime and keep working hard Tell those nerves who s boss Wheelchair recommendationsMy husband uses a Ti lite and really likes it Non foldable chairs are generally going to be lighter  Depending on what your insurance will cover look into rigid wheelchairs sounds like this is not a all day chair and you have all your upper body strength  you can save some money and get a Quickie brand chair they are not bad by any means just not high end like TiLite the ridge chairs are the easiest to push around in and weigh less  Get a lite cushion and a carbon fibet backrest Also some Spinergy wheels     https   www spinlife com critpath match cfm categoryID 135  https   www spinlife com critpath match cfm categoryID 135  Hello  If you re able to go see a wheelchair specialist physical therapist or a wheelchair clinic at a hospital they will be able to design a custom chair perfect for you Unsure you re current function injury but if you re walking you ll probably want a lightweight folding frame  I m an SCI PT   I m happy to help  if you go to a healthcare store they ll likely be able to let you try out a bunch of wheelchairs That s seriously your best bet because you have to be fit specifically for the wheelchair and there are tons of decisions to make the tradeoffs you want to make If you can walk a bit get a travel mobility scooter I have one for anything longer than a 50metre walk They break down and I can lift mine  If you re paying I agree with the poster who recommended quickie not durable but perfect for part time users If you re covered an RGK Maxlite with a closed frame is the lightest and strongest around I use the RGK with a fabric backrest because I have core function and couldn t be happier I used to use TiLite ZRA which is great in other ways but not as light I would say those two are the top picks for lightweight manuals  I got a hell of a deal on my ti lite chair on Ebay  It was completely new but an opened box situation  Best chair I ve had by a long shot    Down side of this method is no insurance  but because I don t use a chair in my house  I don t qualify under my insurance  You should stick with something cheaper like Quickie for an intermittently used chair Since you have walking standing ability you wont need to go all out on expensive seating back cushions   If you have the money or really good insurance then Ti Lites and Per4max chairs are the way to go Per4max is a smaller operation and can take months to get built I use their everyday and sports chairs so I m a bit of a fanboy  you can carry a wheelchair up a set of stairs  I thought your suggestion was great and I took it and went to the closest wheelchair DME store Unfortunately the two girls sitting at the desk were a couple Tweedledees They only had transport chairs out amongst the many rolling walkers and beds I asked if they had light manual wheelchairs and they said that yes they do but they are in their rehab department and they could not show me any There was one behind the desk that I was allowed to look at but not sit in because it was for a customer Unbelievable Now I am still waiting for Medicaid to approve my referral for a fitting and in the mean time I am limited to walks under 300 feet to get anywhere or do anything No I can t it s more like a stoop of a couple stairs but I ll have to lift it up Struggling latelyI was in the same situation 5 years back I am L1 incomplete  I focused on completion my education and learning new technologies after graduation I focused on jobs and got completely immersed into it and still focusing on my career a lot Just choose your goal and focus on the same you will feel a lot better Some days will suck regardless of what you do After I got hurt it seemed like my friends would be there for me but after nearly a decade I haven t heard from them in years I just got back in university after a few years away so it s not unheard of What you should focus on is something productive  writing or reading getting out of your four walls or any other goals you ve had in mind  I think there was a post here about an MD in a wheelchair fulltime They made it work so its possible Hang in there  Turning a wheelchair into a motorcycle or tricycle anyone here looking for a price on these   dont   theyre too expensive to be sensible   go buy yourself a  gotrax com  https   gotrax com  and save yourself the money i use this thing to go a few blocks to work and it is wonderful i just wheelie up to the footplate no attachment needed just hold on like any other person would using it  too bad every one i found was in the thousands really needs to be more affordable  how would that work with a standard chair like ones from hospital  that don t have a solid bar across the bottom This is actually brilliant and I cant believe I ve never thought of this Know what I m treating myself to for xmas And I can just throw it in my trunk and have a power chair without the bulk u are a geniushttps   www googleadservices com pagead aclk sa L ai

twice a day that will keep bacteria from being able to multiply quickly The Hyprex once in your bladder turns into   formaldehyde   so the bacteria cannot replicate easily  Can you explain what you mean when you say you re bladder has been colonized  In addition I also flush my catheter with distilled water daily  There is also citric acid bladder washout to flush out the catheter and bladder That could be considered weekly  Usually the bladder is  sterile   Being colonized means that the bladder has bacteria in it but your body isn t actively fighting the infection Has any used CBD or other Cannabis products to reduce substitute Baclofen I ve never been on baclofen I ve always used cannabis Good question I also take between 60 80 mg per day and it makes me so drowsy at times I have been considering getting my medical marijuana card for this reason It lets me sleep almost the whole night without waking up Usually I snap out of bed with a major spasm in my hamstring calf or shin  Someone recommended magnesium spray or oil to help with spasticity currently I am still in hospital at the moment so I can t test having carers apply this to me every day and see if it works but any natural alternative is worth a try baclofen is the worst when it comes to drowsiness I take 60mg a day   I tried CBD vapes before it definitely helps with general relaxation but nothing super noticeable   I ve also tried lotions and those also don t work great I would say vaping ingestion is probably better  I use CBD oil at night the 1500mg one and CBD cream on my back during the day I don t have much spasms but the oil helps my sleep much better at night just cause it helps me relax The cream is amazing during the day and it mostly helps with nerve pain and soreness I use the CBD clinic level 5  I have a medical card and I still get spasms I don t always use my baclophin but it does help a bit  I have been trying an Epson salt rub at night for the last few days on my calves I would say it seemed to help the morning charlie horses but I might be having a good week or a placebo effect  They want to put me on Baclofen for the last year but I ve been taking a combined THC and CBD oil since my last surgery and find it great for my spasms and neuropathic pain I also find after I ve taken a dose  vaping  that my control over my legs is better I walk with more control and generally feel stronger It has just been made legal in my country for certain illinesses unfortunately spinal cord injury and chronic pain are not included go figure  I m currently on the maximum allowable dose of Baclofen  160 mg day  as well as a 200mg modafinil for the drowsiness a balance which has served me well for about the last 3 years Only just recently heard about the effectiveness of CBD on spasticity and currently take about 100 mg at night to be able to sleep for about 6 hours spasm free Cannot say enough good things about LazarusNaturals Com as they offer a 60  discount for folks on disability like myself Their 99  CBD isolate makes it easy to set up consistent strength doses as well  I m T 6 Para with significant spasticity and Clonus I use CBD products In fact it worked so well I developed my own line of CBD products Check out my story and website  www fleurbotanicals com Always available to answer questions  I have completely weaned myself off of baclofen over the last few years Smoking has definitely helped I have yet to try pure CBD though CBD has been very beneficial for my spasms I have tried both CBD and THC products and for minimising spasticity CBD has worked wonders Please feel free to PM me and I can tell you where when I have seen the benefits For clarification it is an up and coming fad but I have ordered from Charlotte s Web for a couple years now and they have a fantasticaly reputable product  I used thc free cbd oil but I was using it for nerve pain not spasms Either way it did absolutely nothing for me Any strain in particular that you find is more effective Do you smoke vape it eat it use a tincture Yeah the drowsiness makes working tough Plus If I m late on the dose by 1 2 hours I already start to get withdrawals Definitely going to make vaping part of my nightly routine Thanks I ll try magnesium The baclofen drowsiness is not ideal They had me on tizanidine in the hospital and I was a zombie I found I had more control when walking too If only they d approve cannabis products that insurance could cover for conditions other than epilepsy here in the States It s way more expensive than my Baclofen prescription Hopefully legislation comes around where you are Stoked it helps you with sleeping I ll check them out Shower chair recommendationsI ve got a shower commode chair  I get into it

increase or decrease my overall tone which has an indirect affect on my hands   If you have the opportunity I always recommend getting one especially if you have low BP issues  I m in the same boat as you but C6 7 so I have some triceps function 6 years later im fully independent looking into this surgery it seemed like it was more for c4 5 quads who can barley use their arms and cant use their wrists to  open  and close their hands plus Australia got back to me with a price of 180K looks like epidural stim or the Bluetooth wireless bridges they are working on seem most promising I think brown university is trying to have a working prototype in two years time C7 quad who walks  Had a tendon transfer done on my right hand at a VA hospital it opened up my fingers due to them being closed like a fist I was about 1 year and few months post injury when I had it done back in 2013 At the time i was confined to the wheelchair so it helped with pushing picking things up and the ability to do basic life needs with two hands instead of 1 I am sorry I didn t see this post sooner I had a nerve transfer done in 2012 and I was about 8 months out from my accident I had no triceps or hand movement It definitely helped but I moved about 6 months after the surgery so I didn t get the best therapy to see the full benefit With that being said I think it has helped improve my life drastically I can grab and hold a bottle unscrew the lid hold a pen and write  writing looks like a kids  I can pick up and hold other objects I am able to pickup a 12 15 pound dumbbell if needed by creating and maintaining a fist The thing it doesn t help me with is opening up my hand so I always have to shake my hands loose if I need to shake someone s hand   It took about 5 6 months to notice my nerve regenerate and about 10 months to be able to somewhat close my hand into a fist It was about a year to make a decent fist although I ve noticed it is mainly my index finger and thumb that contract the most and the other fingers kinda just follow Imagine pulling a trigger  I have seen a recent video of a quad being able to open his hand and close it so I m sure there has been some advancements in the surgery I was one of the first young people  21yo at the time  to receive this surgery therefore my recovery time was probably quicker than some Also the scars are fairly long about 10 inches My procedure was done by Dr Ida Fox at Washington University in St Louis  My boyfriend is C4 5 6 incomplete 2 years post He has tons of tone spasticity and low BP  Would you mind telling a little more about what the epidural stimulator does for you Have you noticed any increase in core or leg function from the epidural stimulator They say with injury comes innovation so what if any innovation or idea have you thought of or taken to full design since your injury I m an OT so my life and job is adapting   My favorite things I ve made are an adapted cutting board  for a client  and a foot powered door opener for me  My legs are a lot stronger then my arms  Great idea Strangely I miss slippers as well    I was using Dragon voice recognition for my laptop and wanted to be able to use emojis so programmed a AutoHotkey scripts for each emoji I wanted   I made some Bluetooth controlled LED strip lights so I can just control them without getting up   The last thing is a sharpened fork It started off as a joke before I had my accident but it worked really well and ended up being very useful because I couldn t hold a knife in my other hand  wheelchair user for about 2 years at the beginning i struggled having what i needed to carry so to fix the problem my friend at that time gave me an old robe to cut up i made a cover to go over the back with a large pocket on both sides inside front pocket  i d keep things like wallet and other precious items so it couldn t be stolen and quick access stuff like my gloves and hand breaks back side odds and ends like water bottles etc  After injury I was really bummed I couldn t drive my manual car anymore and demanded to have my hand controls be on the right side  why the heck do Americans always put them on the left   as it was more comfortable and similar to driving a manual I got hand controls off eBay that said they were good to go on the right but it turns out they weren t so I was stuck with them on the left   A couple years later I bought myself a car I liked and my husband designed  built a custom hand control brake for it   on the right side He also optimized my Colours gas stick so that it attaches behind the gas pedal Now everything is tucked out of the way and is designed for my comfort It s amazing how the  little  things really can make daily life so much more enjoyable or at the very least less annoying  Well I m in medical device R D But nothing directly related to SCIs  Three months ago I posted a video on Reddit that my wife made for me of my first year of recovery from a serious spinal cord injury that I suffered It trended on the front page Last night we were fortunate to have been on Ellen s Greatest Night of Giveways Thank you Reddit for all your love It s gonna be 3 years

male and I was in a nursing home for the better part of this year after my injury I would be happy to talk with you about anything about it  I am living in a nursing home assisted living facility T10 Complete I will talk about anything you want to I have a low injury but other health issues that weren t being treated properly at home so I didn t have much of a choice or I could keep going to the hospital every 4 7 days and get admitted for over a week 33yo male  I m a 37 yr old male C5 C6 complete quadriplegic I currently living with my parents but I know in the next few years I ll probably be moving to a nursing home I wouldn t mind talking to people to get some idea of what to expect  I m an incomplete cauda equina and spent 6 months in nursing homes after my injury  I was a serious polytrauma patient so I was bed bound for the first 5 months  I was a paramedic before I got hurt and I m a medical student now so I might be able to help with any medical questions you have specifically   Overall living in nursing homes was the worst experience of my life  Keep your head up  There is definitely a way to avoid the experience I had  Looking for options on the 1st World   Goal  Walk againIf there was a real solution this sub wouldn t exist   It is important to be realistic rather than optimistic As someone with a similar injury those crying out for a cure  which is an absolutely natural reaction we all wish for it  I found to be less helpful towards progress to a different life   Keep one eye towards the future but please please keep one eye on the here and now It s a difficult time and support is everything and not accepting what is happening may be detrimental   in my humble experience Please don t ever tell her you won t accept her not walking or put pressure on her to do all sorts of therapy I say this from experience Some people refuse to accept their injury and spend all their time doing therapy for the chance to walk Others chose to stop therapy and just live their life After 6 years I chose to stop doing physical therapy I was graduating from high school and was starting college I chose to focus on bettering my life in others ways rather than just focusing on walking My mom understood and accepted it and my dad did not It caused a strain on our relationship He made me feel guilty for not continuing which made me resent him I was able to graduated from college and have a full time job Be careful with your words and the pressure that is being put on her  As a 5 year C6 incomplete 22 yo male it saddens me to see so much pessimism and lack of faith in these comments Yes accept your injury but never tell yourself you ll likely not walk again bc you never will My father is a physician and with all of the advances in modern medicine being made I am confident there will be a cure  may not be definitive but may help people get back some ability to walk  in my lifetime Without trying you may live the rest of your life regretting not trying every alternative and that s tough to live with Keep one eye on the present and one on the future I have gotten a bachelors degree and very very good job since getting hurt  I am also 100  independent and living on my own  yet I know that one day I will walk again with a combination of effort God and therapy treatments   I am from the US I have been to panama Thailand and I am about to start a 6 week experimental treatment Need to try all alternatives The chance to walk again is greater than any sum of money in my book Because if you can walk it s likely that most things will come back i e bowel and bladder etc  your neice has youth on her side And to everyone on here saying thinking that you ll walk again is not denying your injury or not accepting it I have fully accepted mine yet I know that I ll walk again Mind over matter Don t underestimate the power of meditation either False hope is better than no hope Period If I m 80 years old and still in a chair then oh well at least I know I did all I could do and have no regrets Live life to the fullest either way I have met so many SCI victims and the pessimists never seem to heal while many optimists do I have met multiple middle aged individuals who had recovered some ability to walk after 15 years post injury So never give up even chronic SCI can heal These people did not have any miraculous or special treatment just a case of persistence and mental fortitude and maybe help from a higher being miracles do happen Please be optimistic Happy to talk more to anyone  Think of it this way  if walking full recovery was an option for everyone then there would be no one  or very few  people who are in chairs It s highly highly unlikely that she will walk again That s reality This is her life now whether you want to accept it or not   Now if you d like to give her the best chance to recover as much as her injury allows then there is a place in the US called Project Walk It s a very intense physical exercise facility that focuses on people with spinal cord injuries  It is not covered under insurance and can be very expensive out of pocket The body can recover some and if there is any potential they ll get it out of her For a price of course     A few years ago Project Walk was reorganized and it s now called Adapt https   adaptmovement org about  C5 quad here   Check out Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore MD   feel free to message me for advice on anything I ve only been injured 1 5 years so still fairly new at it but I d love to help however I can Although they are Southern California based https   triumph foundation org resources  people in the community usually can get you in touch with someone closer to you   Edit  http   sci rutgers edu forum  is another much larger forum I am currently at 9 months and I am a C4 quad incomplete  to be told that I am incomplete is a blessing and a curse because basically I could regain more movement or I might not never   I think the shittest thing to understand is you assume there is these options that will save you  when in fact you are basically running on hope   I do not think that is necessarily a bad thing but like the others have said be prepared to think of now as well as the future  setting yourself up for a major fail could be far worse than accepting that walking my not be an opportunity    I am a big believer in trying though and I don t see the harm in that belief as long as you are realistic in your timeline the first few years is fair I think anything beyond that it s just too much I think  sorry to hear about her injury she will hear a lot of  all injuries are different you need to give it time unfortunately thats the truth i dont want to be a downer but at this time there are no cures with that being said this is a good website for info   http   carecure rutgers edu   http   carecure rutgers edu    hope this helps  my injury is c3 4 15 years This is a good resource   Christopher Reeve Hospitals  https   www christopherreeve org research our rehabilitation network nrn clinical centers    You ll find a list of the best hospitals for SCI in the US there   I currently do outpatient at Shirley Ryan in Chicago which is another great place for SCI Like people mentioned above at this point there isn t much likelihood of walking after a complete injury  however  that doesn t mean she shouldn t do as much Physical Occupational therapy as possible   Fleni in Argentina is an amazing rehab facility for SCI with great Physical Occupational therapists and Physicians I was there for inpatient and I received better care there than at Rancho Los Amigos in California    know there are many options out there  especially in other countries like US Canada or somewhere in Europe  Other treatments other therapies other doctors young doctors with new methods and thinking and techniques and many of these treatments and opportunities I know  from experience  will never reach South America   Sorry to tell you but it s just not true If she wants to survive she will have to adapt as best she can   She has a huge advantage over a lot of people with similar injuries as it sounds like she can use her arms and hands so that is a bit of a blessing  I appreciate your lines and comments Thanks   It s not pessimism it s reality  Statistics don t lie my dude  Most of us are not going to walk again barring a serious medical breakthough in the next several decades Most of those of who do regain some ability to walk do not really regain as much as to have a decent amount of greater mobility than us in wheelchairs  To say any differently is just flat out wrong   I ve accepted that I am not going to walk and am living a very happy life knowing that  For the first several years of my injury I kept telling myself that I couldn t accept my life without walking  Pushed as hard as I could to make walking again a reality  My family and friends told me they knew I d walk again too  When I realized it wasn t happening I felt like I let all my loved ones down Like I was a complete failure and my life was gone  So guess where that lead to Me in the hospital after a suicide attempt   After that I began to accept the life I have been given and it was only then that I could truly live it  Insisting that your fellow SCI brothers and sisters not be  pessimistic  is not only ableist it s flat out dangerous   I have met so many SCI victims and the pessimists never seem to heal while many optimists do   It s easy to tell when optimism is completely warranted For example when the injury is incomplete to begin with   Unfortunately the most significant predictor for outcome and recovery is current neurological status   A while ago I saw an interview with the  world renowned  neurosurgeon who performed my surgery 35 years ago He expressed his frustration at the paucity of progress in the decades he had worked already This more than I was asking for Thanks for your kind words and for taking the time Really   It s highly highly unlikely that she will walk again That s reality   Also if the likely happens and she does not walk again it is not anyones fault Not yours and not hers   The central nervous system is not at all forgiving when it comes to injuries Many injuries easily exceed its ability to recover will do THANKS Thank you for such kind words you are amazingly brave and I wish you just the best positive vibes thanks for taking the time Thank uI was hit on the top of my spine and middlePlease seek medical assistance immediately Sounds good just another problem on my list lol i have to deal with I will be sure to call tomorrow and I will try to be gentle I am grateful I could still move just want to be sure I am okay and nothing is broken You need to see a physician who can properly diagnose what happened to you You could have a subluxation or actual broken bones  No one here can tell you if you have an actual injury to your spinal cord But waiting around for things to get better is a good way for you to make whatever injury you already have worse  How long since your injury The spasms could be controlled with medications like baclofen but the numbness needs to be looked at as it can cause permanent nerve damage Is it possible to make a doctor appointment and wait It out  Is this serious I really think you should get this checked out as soon as possible The numbness and tingling is worrisome especially if you just got hurt I will schedule an appointment tomorrowDreaming of a good night s sleepI would definitely like to hear other people s night time routines and things that you have tried to get a better night s sleep I used to cath intermittently throughout the night but I ended up switching to a Foley throughout the night so I don t have to wake up multiple times to go to the bathroom I can make it about four hours in between going during the day but at night it would have to go about every two hours   However now that I use a Foley at night I seem to wake up with a lot more spasms as the night goes on because I am getting dehydrated If I wake up to take drinks throughout the night I run the risk of not being able to fall back asleep as easily My best bet for a good night s sleep is a hot shower and a couple hits on my vaporizer with medical marijuana   I thought it was interesting that the girl from the article also uses a pillow to stay warm throughout the night I also like to cover my chest shoulders and face with a pillow to stay warm and find it a lot better than covering myself with a sheet If my legs get too warm though they spasm a lot and will keep me up   The other thing I have noticed over the last few years is that when I roll on my side my hips and or back will start to hurt so my legs then start to spasm like I am not laying comfortably i m not really sure if it is the way I am positioning myself but any suggestions would be appreciated   Any other similar stories out there  Lots of interesting individual solutions in that article I ll add mine   I m a C4 5 quad and would prefer to sleep on my side but can t tolerate that all night and am forced to sleep on my back  for about nine hours straight my skin seems to cope fine    To kind of trick my body into thinking I m on my side I have rolled bath mats tucked under either side of my pillow to cradle my head It seems to make a big difference to how well I sleep   Also I have to be very careful I don t get too hot as if I do I can t sleep much at all Tricky not to get too cold though as then I spend a lot of the next day trying to warm back up   Also also the antidepressant I m on  duloxetine  works really well for me during the day but results in some pretty nasty dreams of a night which can be even worse than not sleeping I take a low dose of haloperidol at night and that helps a lot with keeping the bad dreams away  Weed   a Faulkner oscillating bed The weed is crucial and helps with my spasms and nerve pain A foley doesn t make you dehydrated I m the same level injury When you are on your side do you keep your legs straight or bend them at the hips and knees It seems like when I am on my side my bottom arm gets a little pinched and my tricep will not stop spasming and keeps me up Otherwise my bottom hip will start to spasm because of the angle of my legs  Any suggestions If you don t mind me asking how much do you have to smoke in order to get the sleep you want How much has your tolerance gone up that you have to smoke more Thankfully I don t need much but I worry about my tolerance slowly going up over time Quadriplegic vlog update On the floor therapy Consistent with spinal cord injury is difficult Do we have any campers I m this subreddit I work

weighing killing myself Shit s hard man but suicide isn t going to make anything better have you signed up for disability or talked to your state s vocational rehab They can really help you get a plan

You ll figure it out eventually and you ll look at what you have and be so grateful that you didn t do anything drastic Hang in there  Feel free to message me if you want to talk Learning to live with

hanging in there ok  Message me if you want to talk  I know you re in pain and physical activity s super difficult but being active is the best antidepressant I ve come across If you can do just a little you ll be surprised how much better you ll feel mentally   I didn t want to either it gets better Promise I have an appointment at Social Security on Tuesday I have been staying in a friend s apartment while he was out of town after leaving an SNF I admittedly have not been proactive in getting disability squared away earlier I am terrified I am going to go there and they are going to deny me benefits I can barely stand or sit for more than five minutes these days I keep hoping that the nerve pain will get better but so far if anything it is worse I appreciate everyone s comments It makes me feel less alone in this I found someone to keep my dog for a little while so I can try to get back on my feet no pun intended It s hard to see things getting better but I am glad to have found this community when I did Massive Oedema for C4 C5 incompleteI had a lot of swelling from DVTs in the leg You ve got to get your feet   above   you heart And that doesn t mean sitting in a chair with your feet propped up That means being in a hospital bed that can raise your feet in the air significantly above your heart to allow gravity to drain the fluid from the tissue  They ll tell you to control your fluid intake at the same time that your urologist is telling you to increase it for bladder health Good luck balancing that  I ve been sleeping with my feet elevated for years now and taking warfarin for anticoagulation   Yes you need a doctor to tell you what s really going on    Any ideas or advice on prevention and managment  Have your doctor figure out if this is merely a hydrostatic issue or if there is more to it  cardiac blood vessel issues    Besides elevating your legs the doctor may also recommend compression stockings or prescribe a diuretic to eliminate some of the fluid  Looking for optionsI m also a T 1 VA patient who d dealt with a lot of pain issues over the last 40 yrs I ve tried all the pain medications accupuncture  nerve blocks the one thing that really helped was CBT   cognitive behavior therapy Basically it s changing your thought process about your pain   training your mind to think differently so the pain does not consume you I was a skeptic but was surprised it actually helped Pain is magnified when your not getting enough sleep or your depressed Can also be worse in winter months especially if you live in a cold climate  I don t know if this is an option but Josh Sundquist posted a video on YouTube recently He s the amputee with the great Halloween costumes He had increasing nerve  phantom  pain issues and apparently if you connect the severed end of the nerve to a muscle so it kind of has a  job  again there s a decent chance the pain will go away Might be worth checking if that could also work for sci nerve pain issues and maybe the damn thing is even close enough to something where rerouting it could end up giving you something useful functional   Otherwise weed seems to work well for some people    Lurking in the sub because I m writing a mystery novel series with a main character with a SCI I m not injured myself    Edit https   youtu be 8A_BI jG7D8 Smoking weed and taking edibles help me a lot with my chronic pain I don t take painkillers or anything  Hmm that sounds interesting can you tell me more about CBT docCan t seem to catch a break As they say the first two years are the hardest Keep your head up it does get easier Try as many new hobbies as possible to keep your mind off things study new things and train your body to adapt research diets can not only help with body issues but with mental ones as well get some sun  I have a syrinx  fluid sac  from C6 T12 and a tumor at T7 T8 I was diagnosed in 1993 and had two surgeries in the next year but the damage was done I feel like you find the right combination of medication and therapy and you do okay for approximately six months to a year and then you have to start again because suddenly you need better more meds or your doctor retires or something else happens Honestly it is very hard and it affects every single part of my life even though I can walk and toilet myself  I constantly need to urinate  and take meds  and don t even get me started on how much of my time I spend constipated or with diarrhea   A good doctor who listens and who will try to help is always important Also if you want to vent the internet is a good place for it since there aren t a lot of SCI groups in real life  I m C5 6 incomplete and also L2 3 have similar and don t mind chatting It s taken four years to finally kind of accept it But I still have many days were I just want to hide in bed and not face the day  I just read this and saw myself I m a C3 C4 incomplete for almost 2 years now and going through the same shit I m seeing a psychologist for it but keep fighting man and if you wanna talk you can hit me up cause i m looking for answers as much as you are  I am a C4 incomplete currently at 8 months and still in hospital I am building a place for myself which might take out the 4 to 6 months so basically a yeah stuck in hospital I lead such an active life 6 2 seven days a week and now try my best to stay busy and looking at ways to cure my injury I imagined that even if it takes 10 years to find a solution I will only be 40 years of age If I can never get to happy place I m not sure how I will feel but until then I am just focusing on the goal of improving as much as I can I think not being able to use my hands if the hardest thing ever if I could use my hands there is so many things I can do There are a lot of days where I feel fucking useless and I hate looking at myself just have to push forward though you just never know what will happen in the future  I ve logged 40 yrs T 1 injury   the issues you bring up can get better It s all about managing them to the best of your ability Like using Miralax every other day to eliminate constipation taking medication or medical marijuana for spacticity  Getting enough sleep to help with fatigue Even after 40 yrs sometimes the issues can get over whelming but they are fixable if you deal with the issues one at a time   try to improve Always keep in mind it seems really bad when your dealing with it BUT there s always someone in a worse position We live in a great country with excellent medical care  supplies I wouldn t want to live in a poor country with sub standard medical care being a quad or para Thank you all of you for your replies Although I don t wish this shit upon anyone not even my worst enemy it is somewhat comforting to know that there s others out there who has managed to power through the same and kept their sanity    It s takes fucking ages mate  C5 incomplete  You will get better than you are now  And  If not you ll be way way better at dealing with your body and the nerve pain  Hang in there  It s shit but it does get easier I m 6 years in  Ups ands down but way way way better than the first two three years  It s brutal no question but you ve already made it this far and been through the worst   For what s it s worth  Your diet plays a big part in you bowel  piss management   If you eat shit expect problems   Something you might not know but the nerve pain is linked to your bowel problems Don t get me wrong  mine never goes away but it does change   When my nerve pain turns up to 11 and I m twitching n shit  guaranteed I need a giant shit or if I feel my intestines I can physically feel a hard build up where I have over eaten like a greedy shit  CHEW YOUR FOOD Allot  Look up stomach massage  I do it regularly especially if my nerve pain goes off It really helps  Know this I have all this and I eat a good diet  Lots of fruit n fibre and all home cooked food Sure I have sweets n alcohol but I don t eat shit I m not over weight etc And when I do got mad boozing or eating crap for while it comes back to bite me literally in the ass  I ve shat my self a few times in public over the years   it ain t pretty  You have to be smart  Massively boozing and or smoking you ain t going to get a handle on it   especially the mental side  Do as much exorcise in any small way that you can Pilates is amazing and so is the swimming pool  If your having issues with the bowels honestly look at your diet  Trust me it s very frustrating and will have you hating life but one thing you can t do is allow it to defeat you You have to adapt your lifestyle to make life easier Whether it s a diet change for bowel n bladder or finding areas on your body that you can pinch in order to take your mind of the nerve pain   I ve been where you are and even though I m nearly 7 years post injury what comes along with SCI still frustrates me but I ve learn to laugh it off and not allow the frustration to control my life  It s not going to happen overnight it s gonna take trial and error to find a routine and or solution that works best for you Thanks man I can see that you ve kept busy looks awesome I m still not able to drive a car hopefully that ll change in the future Bladder management is the worst      Drink more water to decrease your UTIs   Dr    Now I m leaking all the time   Your drinking too much   Dr   Go to Line 1 Baclofen pump   good or bad I was maxed out on oral baclofen AND tizanadine with severe spasms then I got a pump It s been fabulous although I need to get the dosage tweaked again I m a T2 T3 complete I never noticed cognitive issues with oral baclofen but I spend most of my life stoned anyhow   I have to go back every 6 months for a refill and will have to have the pump replaced every 5 years because the battery dies It s so much better than fighting my body every day  I have a c 7 incomplete injury I got a pump 6 years ago and overall it s been a net good I had a lot of issues with tone making my legs rigid and the pump definitely reduced that spasticity far more than oral baclofen ever could   It was tricky at first finding the right dosage high enough to break up the tone but not so high that I lost functionality in my legs   Keep in mind that you re also tied to provider for regular refills I moved across the country and it took a while to find and get established with a new pump specialist It can take up to a year to get a new patient appointment with a spasticity clinic which is too long to wait when you need refills every few months Luckily I found a pain clinic whose doctors could handle the refills while I waited to get in  I ve been using a baclofen pump 1992 I can t even imagine life without it For me the only downsides are getting it replaced every six years and having to refill it every couple of months But other than that it s great  I love not having to take a handful of pills three times a day and living life in a drowsy fog  I too am just about maxed out I take between 60 and 80 per day I m trying to figure out the best way to stagger the dosage because it makes me have these episodes where I can t keep my eyes open for about a half hour I ve been considering discussing a pump too I also have an Interstim device in my spine to help with bladder function I have spinal cord damage around C3 C5 due to spinal stenosis and long term cord compression  My husband is a T5 complete paralyzed 10 years ago baclofen pump for a little over 2 years He is currently weaning off so he can have it removed because he hates it It does decrease spasms noticeably so as he lowers the dosage the spasms are coming back However he feels he can t exercise how he wants and complains of soreness where he can feel above the pump   We did have a pretty terrible experience getting the pump installed so I do think that isn t helping his perception of the pump The neurologist didn t believe his description of his scarring within his spinal column and didn t bother to take xrays and demanded the surgeon insert the tip at T6 and got blocked by the scar tissue causing baclofen withdrawal and surgery to redo the mess a couple months later   His biggest complaint is in movement limitation   which I can t speak on since it s not my body  and he isn t active on reddit or I d encourage him to post instead of me  My biggest worry was every time he went in they wanted to increase the dosage and the effects wore off as his body got used to it similar to oral baclofen He s in his 20s and that sort of constant dosage increase didn t seem sustainable   Your mileage may vary   his experience is not the norm as far as we can tell from other s stories But we both wish we d have researched more and asked more questions beforehand  I have had the pump for 20 years as a t8 para The day the spasm kicked me out of my chair with a full lap of groceries was the point I decided It s been great at stopping the spasm dead It does suck getting topped up and the battery change are annoying but for the most part it s great I do warn ya that if you get it blocked or broken the withdrawal is shit like real shit But it is so much better than the alternative  I ve had my pump 6 years just got it replaced went from a 40 ml to a 20 ml pump I ve been decreasing my dose hoping to wean off eventually but I swear by the pump it s been awesome I ve had no issues and the only time it hurts is when I blank out and drop something on it lol I ve had a baclofen pump for close to 20 years It s amazing compared to taking me massive amounts of pills I was after I was first injured There are a few things you need to know   1 It needs to be replaced about every 5 years due to the battery Unless for some reason they have a better battery and pumps nowadays I had my last pump replaced about three years ago   2 When I first got my pump I was going in every few months to get it refilled Now I m going in about every six weeks So as you need to increase your medication rate The time to go get it refilled will shorten I ve helped reduce that by also using medical cannabis Also if you end up getting it I would schedule all your refills a week before your alarm date just in case there s a malfunction Since major withdrawals from that concentration of Baclofen can kill you if it s not treated quickly The pump has an internal alarm that will let you know if there s something wrong with the pump   Those are the two main things If I can think of off the top of my of any more I ll post again It was definitely a game changer for me I was on 2 other muscle relaxers and Baclofen I no longer use any of them  I m late coming to this post and you might ve already gotten the pump by now but after having 90mg oral baclofen daily doing nothing for my spasms I elected to get the pump My spasms are mostly controlled only experiencing a few minor spasms occurring a few times a day which is a big change from my legs being locked straight out  My refills are about every 3 months I have not yet gotten a replacement so I don t know what that s like  You must of been through the withdrawal   That had to be the worst part of it I reckonHello    movement limitation   can you elaborate please I am considering BP but I am worried that it wouldn t be able to lay on my stomach or something   Thank you Holiday gift ideaWhat do you do during the day The same thing I do everyday  try to take over the world  Six months in I was doing the same thing I had just gotten home from the  rehab  facility and even though I had some in home OT and PT a few times a week I spent most my time on the internet or TV  I did find a few ways to spend the time To accommodate my return home our tiny house had to undergo some renovations  My wife had packed up many boxes of things and clutter and whatnot to get them out of the way  After the renovations were done I moved back in and it was clear we did not have the room to for all this stuff  She had me going through boxes and bags of things to decide what parts of my old life I had to do away with  I know that sounds a bit grim but it wasn t most of this stuff I should have disposed of years ago anyway  I mean how many pairs of cargo shorts or old crocs did I need anyway  So for a few weeks I slowly sorted things out  In the process she found my old guitar in the attic and asked if we could finally get rid of it  I d had this thing since I was sixteen and quit playing when I was nineteen but I just kept moving it with me place to place through the years never even opening the case like a little icon of my lack of discipline and musical talent  I was going to just let it go but that same day my neighbor from across the street called me up  He said  Hey I just had my fiftieth birthday and I decided to buy myself a banjo They need a signature when they deliver it do you mind if they deliver it to your house   So no problem they delivered it two days later and he came over and got it that night Here s the deal though a little spark had lodged in my cold heart and I kept thinking about him buying that banjo for his fiftieth birthday even though he said he had never played any instrument before  Why the heck not I love the banjo I ve always wanted to try it  he said  I started thinking about my old guitar sitting on the goodwill pile  I was about to turn fifty  So right before my wife loaded it up to give away I stopped her  I opened the case pulled it out and tried to tune it no luck I thought I bet there s an app for tuning guitars  Sure enough I downloaded one and managed to get that thing in tune I still remembered a couple cords and strummed away I couldn t even remember the strings But It felt great I mean I felt great doing it So after googling and you tubing a bit I realized that I had basically unlimited guitar lessons and knowledge at my fingertips It had just never occurred to me  Well let me make this long long story shorter by saying that summer I started spending a little time every afternoon with my guitar in the garage  My neighbor noticed me came on over and we ended up striking up a great friendship We even get together and pluck and strum away while enjoying a couple beers  Even though we are terrible  really terrible not trying to be modest just so bad  we are having loads of fun just talking and laughing and being stupid  So what do I do with my time  I tried something new something I would never ever have had the time or attitude to do before this and even though I suck at it that s not the point it s something I look forward to everyday and enjoy learning and trying new things  No pressure at all every little gain is wonderful and there is really no way for me to fail Even more important is I gained a new friendship  I have always been a pretty private person but trying this new thing helped me open up   So my advice is buy a banjo and have it delivered to your neighbors house  Or have someone dig your old guitar out of the attic You may have an opportunity to find something that s fun rewarding and totally unexpected I hope you do  I m gunna say that you and your wife might need some counseling to deal with this in the long run Secondly what does she want you to do Work School Volunteer  Some ideas  go to the library start writing an autobiography or journal take online classes in subjects that interest you try following a painting tutorial plan a vacation to an accessible city near you  research hotels things to do etc you don t have to book anything just look into it  explore your city try cooking new things   What were you and your wife initially planning on doing in retirement  Its important to know your level of ingury that being said besides working i like to workout a lot fish wood work work on my car basically everything id do as an able body except for sports really and thats only because in a quad  what is it thats stopping you from doing what you used to Health conditions are you complete incomplete are you going to recover  If you are an active type person and were planning to spend your retirement years doing physical activities then you should find some adaptive sports My personal favorites are handcycling scuba diving sailing and rowing but there are many others and availability might depend on your geographic location and what other people with disabilities are into near you Hiring people do do the snow removal house cleaning and lawn care has been a huge relief Also I saw you mention travel You can definitely still do this I just got back from a trip to Japan Start planning a trip  I started wood working I can take my time and I had a friend make custom height work tables for me Now I am all set and I can make almost anything at 6 months that s mostly what I did too although I was paralyzed when I was 16 so I had some homework  I was mostly on homebound for 11th and 12th grade so I could graduate on time  i m now a junior in college coming up on 4 years post injury and I just do all the regular things i m a full time student with a part time job when i m not in class at work or studying I hang out with friends or read books you find stuff to do but you sound pretty normal for 6 months  Sometimes I try to figure out how to do basic things I once took for granted  A high light bulb burned out with a fixture really had me stumped the other night  I live alone    I also work part time to pay my bills and more than anything keep my hands and head busy   Draw up plans to make my little cruising sailboat paraplegic friendly  That project might actually get off the ground in the Spring    Currently helping a friend rebuild his Perkins  marine diesel  in his garage   Work out the muscles I can control and practice walking on the walker  less in the winter as  well  the cold makes spasms so much worse and I end up on the floor a lot   Shhh I thought you weren t going to tell anyone of your evil plans  are you pondering what i m ponderingI have a guitarI love this story so much I also have a banjo that has moved with me 5 times OP do the guitar thing I was 10 months from retirement so definitely not work She just wants me to do something productive All of the above but mostly travel hi stairphobe how much have you recovered   crutches walker or chair  ATC conversions reviews My aunt is selling her brand new Honda Pilot with a wheelchair lift The driver seat is not wheelchair ready but I m sure that could be converted PM me if you d like more information  I m thinking about working some under SGA limit Anybody do this and if you work under SGA limit do you have to contact social security I m not looking for a ticket to work considering I m not looking to go past any limit because I want to see if I can handle it and go slow You should contact Social Security with copies of your pay stubs just so you do not end up with an overpayment Any work attempt can trigger a  reconsideration  of your disability claim meaning they may ask if you are still disabled under Social Security rules If you are on SSDI you have nine months in which you can earn as much as you want and keep your benefits and then you can keep receiving a check for three more months SSDI is disability based on your own work record Typically SSDI comes with Medicare after 24 months Supplemental Security Income or SSI is poverty based and your checks will change with any earned income  approximately  1 less for every  2 earned   Source  I used to work for the Ticket to Work program before I became disabled    Supplemental Security Income or SSI is poverty based and your checks will change with any earned income  approximately  1 less for every  2 earned  Source  I used to work for the Ticket to Work program before I became disabled    I want to say that this applies not just to earned income but also to assets and savings and so on like I vaguely remember hearing stories about people who couldn t qualify for SSI until they had nearly emptied their bank accounts and were literally about as poor as they could possibly beweight controlBest way eat a high protein diet   eliminate sugar  carbs salt Your body will burn calories digesting the protein  There is hidden sugar   salt in most foods excess sugar makes you gain weight The excess salt makes you retain fluids making you heavier  There s plenty you can still do for exercise including cardio I m a t6 complete and I try to do dips in my chair often for cardio I do about 50 in a row to work up a sweat and get the blood pumping and I try to do that everyday  Playing wheelchair basketbal hasn t helped me a lot with my health Find a nearby team of a wheelchair sport that interests you and try it out  Very low carb diet gym membership  yes there are plenty of weight machines you can climb on to and use at T 4  and hand cycling for cardio  I m T 6 x 29 years  Not para but quad and came here to say wheelchair sports as well   I don t have trouble with weight right now but it helped with strength and general fitness a huge amount I highly recommend swimming and sled hockey  i want to make equipment cheaperThat sounds like a really good idea And I agree it is absolutely ridiculous insurance does not cover this  facing this myself  It would be great if someone would be able to assist in passing on the benefits of bulk pricing   I would be happy to purchase and support such an industry Many DME equipment are actually cheaper when purchased in bulk outside of insurance because of reducing costs like administration and such   If you do plan on starting good luck and I would be happy to hear and possibly help in any way that I can     I have no problems getting what I need from Amazon usually in less than 5 days  My shower toilet chair combo was about 85 bucks Not the best build quality but it s lasted me several years  It seems that with how many different options for equipment there is out there any everyone s needs are different it would be hard to supply the right product for everyone I think you would quickly turn to upping prices only to make it remotely viable Also my medicaid paid for my shower chair my guess is most disabled folks are on some kind of insurance that pays for their needs and will put up with time to save hundreds of dollars  I m curious  what kind of shower chair do you have That seems like a steep price unless it s a specialized one I definitely agree that equipment is ridiculously expensive  Last year I bought a  5k stainless steel reclining shower chair needing something that wasn t going to nickel   dime me with repairs  I ordered this with a few bells   whistles not pictured https   razdesigninc com index php shower commode chair raz at attendant tilt    I ve spent enough time in those wobbly pvc fuckers to be able to part with that much cash for something solid and comfortable  I think it s a great idea for sure If you want to add another level to the business which I would definitely be a customer of is figuring out a way to incorporate a travel aspect to it It s a pain in the butt traveling with my shower chair but if I could arrange to rent one at my Destiination it would help out a ton with being able to travel easier This could go with A number of different medical Devices that people need to travel with  If you know anything about how the taxes and reporting works it would be helpful I have an LLC set up with federal state and county tax IDs but I m not sure if I need a business license since it s all online and how I report online revenue at a sales tax level Yeah my insurance paid for everything but bathroom supplies My therapists at shepherd said most people don t get coverage on it But yeah that s my concern because if I spend a bunch of money buying bulk but I don t sell them I will lose a lot of money in overhead maintaining a site and business license That s what my supplier quoted me for a standard medical one you see at hospitals but I bought one off Amazon for around  120That s pretty fancy and worth just a courtesy look at my supplier I found something similar ranging between  700 1k Yours is probably a better build thoughC5 level incomplete struggling with work school and relationshipsI m 25M c5 6 7 and have been injured for 2 years now I use a chair full time no leg function mild core and hand function   As far as shaking hands goes I usually just give em the paw they figure it out lol   As for bowel and bladder I do a bowel program every morning if you don t do one it sounds like you should consider it  as far as bladder do you take any medication for incontinence issues   Also have a bag for emergencies in your car if you have an accident  accidentally  spill your drink on yourself Excuse yourself and go get cleaned up in the bathroom  Just say the lack of quality hand function can cause this to happen that s why you have the spare bag   As far as athletics I was a competitive runner and climber so I understand how upsetting it can be Try finding some wheelchair sports they can be just as fulfilling I play wheelchair rugby and compete in triathlons Just find what you enjoy   Also while the story of your injury can be a great tool for your field you don t have to tell it to anyone you don t want to  IDK if you all have seen this video on GMA but I ve watched it several times It should give us all hope that we truly will walk again Here is my reaction video I was very interested when I saw the video so I dug into the details The full paper isn t published yet but the Mayo institute posted a case report   LINK  https   newsnetwork mayoclinic org discussion case report stem cells a step toward improving motor sensory function after spinal cord injury   While the result is promising it is important to note that the video is slightly misrepresenting how promising it is Firstly of the ten people this patient was the only  superresponder  while the others were moderate or non responders Secondly while this patient did make significant improvement after the trial he did have walking function before the study started Further along the case report they show this     The patient was observed at baseline and at regular intervals over 18 months following injection His physical therapy scores improved For example in the 10 meter walk test the patient s baseline of 57 72 seconds improved at 15 months to 23 seconds And in the ambulation test the patient s baseline of 635 feet for 12 8 minutes improved at 15 months to 2 200 feet for 34 minutes    So he definitely made significant improvement from baseline but he did have walking function The video makes it seem that he went from complete paralysis to how you see him in the video but that is not true I m not writing this to discourage people s enthusiasm but I think it is important to be realistic   I m not a neurologist so if anyone is and sees that I am reading this wrong I am happy to be corrected   If anyone is interested here are the eligibility details for participating in the study   https   www mayo edu research clinical trials cls 20357889  https   www mayo edu research clinical trials cls 20357889  The problem with most neurological injuries is that the best predictor of recovery or progress appears to be the patients current level of function   And this is a phase 1 trial   https   www mayoclinicproceedings org article S0025 6196 19 30871 7 fulltext  Phase 1 trials are not even about establishing efficacy of a treatment but about figuring out whether the proposed treatment is safe to use on a larger treatment group and what dosages are tolerated They can be performed on a hand picked treatment group there is no randomization no blinding no control group    Phase 1 trials mean very little unfortunately Even Phase 2 trials mean little   this is the stage where still on a hand picked patient group it is examined whether there is a chance of the treatment actually being beneficial   Things only get interesting in Phase 3 trials Those are usually randomized and controlled and this is where a new treatment needs to show that it is better  more effective fewer side effects etc   than current established treatments Insurance covers gloves thank you for posting  I am really struggling right now with how to move forward Hey there It can be harder for folks with incomplete ambulatory SCI  because you ve had some recovery but not enough to be like you were It s like a state of limbo   All I can say is I see you you re not alone and there are others like you out there My org has a Facebook group for incomplete SCI and you are welcome to join it just search and ask to join Did your suicide attempt result in any mental health treatment for you when you were recovering That s a super tough obstacle on top of the physical stuff of SCI recovery and probably needs it s own attention for you to tackle the next phases of recovery   I actually knew a woman who was injured as a L1 incomplete SCI similarly to you when she jumped from a 3rd story window during a suicide attempt triggered by a delusion She now has a family kids a steady job and is a wicked wheelchair basketball player It s possible to survive this You just need some support and knowledgeable help   I hope you ll keep reaching out for help   a lot of us understand what you re going through and you deserve to have support with what you re going through I d be happy to try to help you more in dm s if needed My org might be able to help you find help near you  I m not in the exact same boat living situation wise but I have incomplete L1 4 and can walk with afo I can t get disability because my will to walk again doctors are shit I m just going to do self care until I stop existing I feel like we fucked up some how and now are lives are forever different from  able  body ppl My old friends don t get it docs don t care family just gets sad when my pain gate paralysis issues get brought up I also have to deal with the fact my car accident took my friends life when we were 16yrs old in 2006 I still wear the same broken and ducted tape back together for 13yrs I have had 14 different jobs I had to quit due to due embarrassment from bladder or bowel issues that cause me terrible stomachs pain so I don t eat so I won t have to shit or risk a massive accident in a social situation Ppl just don t get this shit at all There is no ONE answer for any of us Do it or do not there is no try I m in the middle I can t kill myself because it s selfish and I m only alive for ppl to be burdened by my mean ass attitude that s developed I have PTSD and major depression yet  doesn t change the fact I can logically see our society is massively fucked up and I don t want to be a part of it I wish I could take everyone here s pain and issues I wish you the very very best and hope you grow stronger than I did     car accident 2006 L1 L4 incomplete sci 2 rods and 14 screws and the death of friend I caused Congratulations on starting to walk again That is a fantastic step Do you qualify for SSDI or SSI Additionally do you have any place where you can stay Especially the first few months are the most painful If you have anyone who can at least help you with a place to get some sleep and relax that would make significant improvements in your health   Focus on the recovery And when I say that I do not only mean physical Try to work on your employment education mental health  Literally everything   If you have a safety net in terms of friends or family please asked them for help I know firsthand how difficult that can be But please stay strong   Let me know if you need any advice on where to start  Could you share the name of the Facebook group  I d love to join Self catheter newbie looking for advice Glad to hear surgery went well  sounds like you will have an easier time adjusting I think UTIs are mainly caused by not draining the bladder all the way and over time it can form a UTI i could be wrong I was Hospitalized once for a UTI  I thought i just had the Flu so watch for shivers and fevers as these can be signs Have you tried bladder relaxing medication I take 8mg Toviaz every morning and can tell the diff if i forget to take it Otherwise just be mindful of how much you drink and when also what Coffee makes me go more frequently and try to avoid large amounts of liquid hours before bed  Self cathing can be challenging the beginning but it sounds like you re motivated to learn I personally have found hydrophilic catheters to be much easier to deal with Here s my process  Grab a cath prep the Cath  break water sactche and shake   Move forward on my chair  pull my pants down  Use some hand sanitizer Grab what one wipe the tip Place cloth in the spill area Place pee bottle between legs Insert breathing and going slowly are important   When removing I pull out the cath a bit and put a bit of pressure on my bladder to ensure full drainage  Finally when ready to remove Place finger on the end of the Cath to prevent any back drainage Remove while taking deep breaths on the out breath   Hope that was helpful good luck Best UTI prevention I have found is drinking a bunch of water  There are two main types of intermittent catheters   pre lubed and not If your insurance allows a prelubricated catheter I d go for it especially if you have sensation If not you can get a regular catheter like a hollister apogee and and lube it using little packets instead   It s not hard to learn   I was taught over a weekend when I was 8 Just know it s important to establish a clean routine for how and where you self cath Work with your nurses and rehab people to try a variety of catheters your insurance will cover so you can pick the one that works best for you It s helpful to understand the anatomy so hopefully they ll have an educator who ll walk you through it  Are you a male or female  My suggestions are a  use prelubed catheters if they are covered by insurance I use Cure Ultra and I ve been very happy with them b  use some sort of antiseptic every time I get Wet One s Singles and carry 6 catheters and 6 wet ones each day c  carry one set in your pocket and the rest in your backpack or whatever Then whenever you are in the restroom you have the supplies you need  Hey all very happy to find this thread   My mother was recently told by her doctor that she needs to administer some medicine to her bladder via self catheter   She s 70 and was a nurse most of her life and has definitely administered many catheters to others but is very nervous about self administering and worried about pain She tells me she has a very narrow urethra  sorry if that s TMI  and though she has purchased the smallest catheters is still concerned about their size and pain   Any tips other than the ones here or videos group suggestions would be greatly appreciated   Thank you all  Just wanted to say thanks for all the advise Got thought yesterday and I m very happy to report it all went well hygiene is key as everyone said Thanks again for all the support Oh yeah I broke out of hospital yesterday   Thanks for the fever and shivers tip I was On Toltertan SR 4mg pre op for hyperactive bladder so stopping me going so often but I m assuming they will make a change to my meds once I see urologist on Monday Thanks sound like you re a master of it they haven t brought me through the process yet but this give me some idea of what expect   How often do you find you need to do it each day Thanks that s really helpful I hadn t even considered there might be different types of devices I m in Ireland so not sure what options will be open to me yet but good to know not to just accept the first offered but find what works for me    Can I ask how often do you find you need to use it in a day with your regular fluid intake Sorry should have mentioned that F43 Hi I m afraid I don t have any advise other than find the smallest Cath she can I know when I first saw the Cath I thought to myself  there s no way that s going to fit up there  but it was fine   For me it doesn t hurt at all but I m not sure if that is because I have no feeling down there or if it just doesn t hurt hard to for me know as I m still in recovery   I hope all goes well for your mum Spending a lot of time figuring out what is and is not a problem below the level of injury   does this get easier over time Yes it gets easier with time I m  19 years out and can know when I ve been siting on my butt too long when I need to pee when I need to poo when I m getting diarrhea cramps when my injured knee hurts when I m about to cum and what feels good to get there  And I can t feel anything below my arms My signals are all from dysreflexia  changes in BP chills etc    How long have you been injured It takes time to learn what signals mean what I consider my legs like solar panels Keep a blanket on your lap and make sure they re warm As quadriplegics we are always cold Get a  35 trapper hat off of Amazon and a heat dish from Cosco  At night you can use a  35 matches warmer off of Amazon as well If you are talking about the hair standing up on your head neck  signs of oncoming AD  then it could be a bunch of things  sitting on a wrinkle signs of catheter starting to clog hangnail signals you may be getting backed up It definitely gets easier Awesome like I ve learnt some things   like checking changes in BP and chills but everything else has fallen into the  oh I feel weird  thing and then having to spend sometimes a long time trying to figure out why Weight shifting I m pretty good at but that s just out of habit more than anything else For bladder rn I check BP and bowel is program Most of my signals are from dysreflexia beyond some nerve pain   Good to know it gets easier I kinda assumed it did but wanted to check because maybe I was wrong and I just had to learn to deal Not that long about 3 months   the cold thing is something I learnt pretty quickly because winter struck harsh where I live but its good to know that you can at least learn what the signals mean because right now just trying to check everything when I feel something is difficult I had a preexisting smaller lesion prior to this injury very small at C2 and then larger at C5 6  and it never caused that much bother except bladder and some motor so learning how to assess things I can t feel is pretty new   Take tonight chills hair standing up on back of neck like you say and some worsening tremors and it turned out that wearing these specific jeans with buttons on the back pockets is just a really bad idea I m fine now but it took me a while to figure that out   Thanks for the tips about the cold though My room mate sometimes gets annoyed when I mess with the heating but all her nerves work properly so we have differing temperature needs NuMotion woesYes they are the absolute worst to work with I have had problems with my chair ever since I got it and they still have not gotten to the bottom of the issue and it s been over a year Will never work with them again on my next chairs  they re terrible i ve worked with two different branches in different cities never got anywhere with them until my parents started threatening lawsuits  i m transgender and I experienced some transphobic discrimination from one branch  if took like 2 months to get my batteries replaced then they brought the wrong ones and took 3 more months to bring those definitely won t be working with them again  I love the technicians that have worked on my chair but absolutely hate the slowness of their office side Averaging 2 3 months when something needs approval They are horrible all accessibility workers are either amazing or they are in it for the money They have a monopoly and they use their power at Will Who do you use then So who do you go with now Sounds like my experience Are there any alternatives What competitors can I look up This is a good pointHow to discuss my SCIMost people aren t going to understand regardless of how you word it I just say I broke my neck and if they ask more I point to my C5 bone If they ask more I go into more detail say bones 4 6 are fused I m incomplete  and what that means  where my function stops if they want to know etc  you have a neurological injury that disrupts signals from your brain to your limbs and also from the central nervous system  your spinal cord  to various organs that the CNS regulates  bladder bowels  if your injury was higher it would include lungs   If they don t understand why a limb doesn t work because of a SCI I say imagine that I m a robot and some of the wires are frayed so the signal doesn t reach each part properly That image usually helps people understand  From my  limited  understanding the vertebral level referenced on the ASIA scale is the lowest   most caudal   point of normal function So if your injury is at C5 the reference to C4 that your doctor gave you is the right technical answer But I would agree that the specifics of your ASIA impairment scale  score  won t mean much to most people My experience is second hand  I m the parent of a daughter who was injured when she was ten so a lot of the explaining to other people what had happened to her fell to my wife and me   Mostly depending on context we d describe her accident  in more or less brutal terms depending on the tone of the question  she was knocked off her bicycle and run over by a school bus which has pretty strong shock value if you want to shut down questions from nosy busybodies    and just say that she has a spinal cord injury and is paraplegic Medically speaking she s T9 ASIA A but that s meaningless to anybody who hasn t any experience in the world of SCI  Nontraumatic but same level and incomplete quad also I mostly point to where the injury is and then explain my function stuff   like what s effected and sometimes why if they really don t get the idea of lesions I find that people usually aren t into the specific technical stuff and more just want a vague idea of location and effect  Thanks everyone I definitely appreciate the insight It is certainly somewhat confusing but when I speak to most people just telling them it s a spinal cord injury is all they care to know I think I will continue to use the info my doctor gave me when talking to others with a spinal cord injury  just tell people you have a spinal cord injury  some will pry and ask further but it is your decision to engage in conversation with them  the nosy come in a couple of flavors    I used a wheelchair for 6 weeks so I know how you feel    is it permanent   like it is a death sentence or something   I bet if you work hard you can walk again  like walking is the be all end all of human feat I would probably say C6 incomplete but I would probably need to meet you and see how you move before I could say that Ha my favorites are  have you tried acupuncture  and   if you went back to the gym you could build up those muscles  and I m not in a wheelchair yet Crutches and a scooter Back injury from lifting   predisposition to brain injury permanent memory loss in fight   got into a nasty fight would you be in greater risk of permanent brain injury   No   But getting into a nasty fight and receiving head trauma increases the risk of permanent brain injury immensely  Thanks and I got similar confirmation from asking friends in the field Is anyone a teacher Hello my friend messaged me your question and I registered just to answer  you should feel special    I am a high level quad substitute so I m in a different class each day which makes it tricky for me on the topics you discussed   But here is what I suggest    start off by being open about your disability and why you are in a chair Every time I sub I start out with  I m sure you noticed I am in a wheelchair I broke my neck 11 years ago  blah blah blah  By doing so you acknowledge the elephant in the room and build rapport w  the students And if you are doing 6th grade the kids will love this  from my experience  because they are curious monkeys Use the opportunity to advocate for people with disabilities If they have any questions tell them you will discuss them individually during their break or lunch   As for classroom management just be a leader Tell them you will show them respect if they give you respect Talk to them never down to them Also use the  if you can hear me clap twice technique  and don t be afraid to say  that was weak  and challenge them to do better with repeating    As for writing on the board you can always ask for a volunteer to help But more importantly you should ask your school district for accommodations with a dot camera or something else Legally the have to do something I recommend reaching out to the Job Accommodation Network  JAN  for help They know their stuff   The students will probably like you having to rearrange the class They typically like change so embrace it   It can be stressful but you got this Just make sure to get the accommodations you need to do the job Everything else will iron itself out in time   Sincerely   Chris  I am a college professor  I don t have any classroom management issues so much   Regarding writing on a chalkboard could you get a projector mounted interface with a computer and use a pad stylus to display work or even just typing the information with word notepad  Mayo Clinic starts trials using Abdominal Fat Stem CellsAs other commentors have said there is a lot of information to fill in But if it s repeated looks better than any exo skeleton I ve seen   I wasn t going to go here but I must I know he was in a bad place mentally before the treatment However to say that we have nothing to lose from the treatment risks as if the effort and fulfilling results of the life we ve built for ourselves is worthless  is so astonishing and ableist that I ve run out of metaphors Seriously my life isn t perfect but it s mine and reflects the effort I put in and the order of my priorities It is worth living  Any links to the study Would like to know levels of the other patients  This whole segment is presented in a pretty misleading way They gloss over hastily mention the information that indicates this gentleman has an incomplete injury  ie moving parts of his body below his level of injury  and then generalize his injury to say  the neck down  which does nothing to inform as to the severity of what s going on  There are people who have posted videos ON THIS FORUM  scroll down to August 2019  with incomplete injuries who have had similar improvements and no stem cell experiments   I m so happy for his recovery just feel a bit dubious that it was the stem cells and worried that someone clinging to something anything to help them  insert whatever your particular  thing  is will think this is where it s at   Also disappointed in the Reeves kid  An interesting study with only one patient but the results are remarkable Not trying to spark false hope in any of us but I m glad to see some progress in the research   Edit  There were nine other people in the study that didn t have as extreme of a response   Here is an article I found with some more details   Mayo Clinic Study  https   newsnetwork mayoclinic org discussion case report stem cells a step toward improving motor sensory function after spinal cord injury   This is just a phase 1 study with ten people It s only a test for safety There are no controls and very few participants This guy s recovery is equally likely to be just a normal trajectory for somebody with his level of injury Sorry this is just media hype  While the thought of a cure can be uplifting don t allow it to cloud your personal journey to recover Continue to work hard physical to get your body in the best shape you can regardless of a cure If one happ to come along then you know your body is healthy enough to withstand the risk   Not looking to call anyone with SCI out but I ve came across peers who have relied heavily on the production of a cure rather than putting physical work in Our bodies are made to move and not moving only deteriorates us There is an adaptive way to almost anything so find a way  Supremely awesome news  I am tracking progress of this from now thanks for the share Everyone is different and everyone approaches their injury differently  The goal is barring recovery to get you living your life as independently and functionally and meaningfully as possible But for some people that takes years if it ever comes They have just as much a right to their feelings about their injury as you do to yours This is the best I could find  Study   https   newsnetwork mayoclinic org discussion case report stem cells a step toward improving motor sensory function after spinal cord injury  There were 10 participants The others had less dramatic results It was 11 months after his accident so I highly doubt this was part of his own body recovering  however they did say he was  super responder  Physical therapist here  it s absolutely not Progress like this  can  happen depending on level of injury and complete vs incomplete but it takes years  not weeks As the doctor said this is a first step on the way to a breakthrough Thoughts on Lotus catheterMy immediate thought was  Keep that  way  away from my urethra    Is that the preliminary design for what became the Foley catheter  Hi Can you please elaborate on why are you cautious about the design   It s not a prototype it s a new design called Lotus catheter When inside your bladder you expand the tip of the catheter so that the  petals  are keeping it inside and the urine is flowing through the large drainage port at the base of the petals How do you handle the comments Comments happen all the time  L1 incomplete AFOs cane    I ve learned that some genuinely want to be encouraging and after 5 years I come to terms with the comments it is fine I take in the spirit it is offered   What I receive a lot of is others who want to share a personal story of a friend family member who has undergone a traumatic experience They start a conversation so that they can tell me their story On good days I m open to listening to their stories and providing encouraging responses On bad days I m not as charitable headphones on and doing my best to ignore the world I do find it fascinating that so many people are suffering and they are willing to tell a stranger about their pain Have you experienced this  Nothing like  I was on crutches once  or  I had to use a wheelchair for a week  so man I get it especially for those who don t realize I m in a custom chair and I cannot stand up At all  So is it permanent   No I just use this everyday chair and my legs spasm everywhere for fun  I m L1 incomplete using wheelchair and crutches  I get a lot of these comments too Some days they don t bother me but other days they piss me the fuck off The comments always come People will always say stupid shit Sometimes when I really don t want to deal with it I ll just wear headphones even if I m not listening to anything   At first I felt like I had to smile and respond politely to everyone every time this happened And I did for a while But eventually I realized that I don t need to owe that to them Sure I m not gonna be a duck and tell them to fuck off when they say  you got this  or whatever but you don t have to fake a smile and say thanks either Once I started letting myself just ignore things when I didn t feel like replying it got a lot easier to handle But there s always going to be times when you do just have to grin an bear it unfortunately   For example yesterday I was talking to someone from upper management at work and they started talking about how they understand how much it sucks to be in a wheelchair because they needed to be in one for FIVE WHOLE WEEKS after their foot surgery In my head I was rolling my eyes and wanting to say  fuck off Julie  but instead I smiled and went along with it   December 1st is going to be one year post injury for me At this point I know that I have a disability not just an injury that s going to completely go away at some point but a lot of people I interact with occasionally don t realize that yet When I see people once every few months they see my progress and ask how long I ll need the crutches or when I ll be able to give up the wheelchair For me it s the acquaintances that get to me more than the strangers IDGAF if strangers think I m rude but it gets more difficult with people I need to maintain professional relationships with People I work with daily have gotten better as they ve discovered their missteps   You ll get better at handling it It s always going to suck though Just make sure you re giving yourself license to not cater to their pandering if you re not feeling up for it Personally i try not to get upset with the people but instead get upset with their lack of experience interacting with people with disabilities I m rambling at this point but yeah Hope you can relate to or find some of this helpful   Edit   Oh the thing that pisses me off the most is when old people give me dirty look when I  a mid 20s person  park next to them in a handicap spot until they see my hobbling around on crutches or putting together my wheelchair Fuck them Lol My partner uses crutches when we go to dinner etc T1 incomplete People always ask what s happened and kind of lets them invent a story More entertaining for us I guess Oh what you done there Football injury  Yeah  oh well hope it gets better soon Cheers  I find it to be pretty exhausting especially on the days that I push myself to go out because I feel I should be among some humans and not just my animals  I often end up feeling like the odd one out and non human anyway and or like others here I put my headphones in to avoid the comments and questions and end up blocking myself off from other humans anyway   I experience a lot of loneliness which is a combination of how I m treated and my personality depression  I ve always been socially anxious and adding the wheelchair experience on top of that has been pretty difficult  It s taken me a long time to learn how to be more gracious with people s comments and questions    but I still find myself avoiding people because of them  I ve also learned how to set better boundaries like not feeling like I have to answer the What Happened To You question   I was in a wheelchair once for a while     I fucking hate this I get it People are trying to relate to me But being in a wheelchair because you busted your ankle is entirely different situation than being in a wheelchair because you busted your spine  Not walking is about 2  of my problems and I won t ever heal and get on with my able bodied life  I m in 4 wheels forever Fuck off   Sorry  Rant After 22 years I typically am nice but don t tend to hand around or engage people   I refuse to take pity or play into someone s supercrip frame I am generally on the move  afo walker is too slow for me so I stopped that 20 years ago  and a rolling stone gathers no moss  I m what people would consider a walking quad I use a AFO and typically using a forearm crutch on my left side   I ve been walking without the crutch for couple months    I don t mind the comments we live in a curious World and some will verbalize their curiosity and in over the years I ve grown to understand life is to short to not to at least respond to the comments and or questions politely To me it s just comes along with the injury so I don t mind     x200B   I rather you just come up to me and ask what happened than being stared at any day So annoying  How do any of you deal with the excessively religious ones  I mean all the time I get  god bless you  and  I ll keep you in my prayers  but today I had no idea how to handle two very intense women that I couldn t gimp fast enough away from  They insisted that I needed to find Jesus that he would heal me that they had witnessed the healing  basically after an exorcism    of a man who had been in a chair for 35 years that I should drink holy water and do a thousand hail mary s etc  No joke  It even got weirder than that when they started praying for me on the spot one with her hand in the air the other tearing up as she prayed  They stayed for a solid 20 minutes before moving on and about half way through all I could think about was how much I needed a seat but I didn t want to sit and have them sit with me  I realize I didn t owe them anything and they were genuinely interested in  helping  but it was so far from helpful   it was actually quite painful  physically   I have to say all comments and questions from others who crossed my path were child s play after that  Perhaps they feel we re more inclined to be naturally sympathetic understanding and easier to talk to as a stranger who is nonjudgmental has no context and they ll probably never meet us again  It s kind of like a one night stand on vacation   everything flows a bit more freely people tend to be more spontaneous and carry less baggage  after all the odds of meeting again are slim to none Also  I rode in my grandma s a few times wheelchairs are a lot of fun  I pulled into best buy the other week and parked next to another car  Opened the door and the guy next to me rolls down the window and tells me the cops just gave a ticket to a car who forgot to put their placard up I wish I had quicker wit but I just went with  good for them   As soon as I pulled my frame out and started putting my chair together I glanced over and I could see the embarrassment on his face gave me a good chuckle shades are great for putting yourself in a different world   I have started wearing them in grocery stores almost exclusively   that cuts down on interacting with people  Oh the thing that pisses me off the most is when old people give me dirty look when I  a mid 20s person  park next to them in a handicap spot  I ve had SCI C 7 incomplete for 30 years That used to bug the ever loving crap out of me in my twenties and thirties These days I m a little sad I don t get more dirty looks   One thing I try to keep in mind is that businesses and governments force people with disabilities to be in constant competition with each other for parking spaces by never supplying enough Which breeds constant suspicion that the driver next to you might be  cheating   It doesn t excuse the dirty looks but it explains them Acquaintances are particularly hard  Before my injury I was a licensed captain working on various boats and               The comment that gets me the most is  Keep it up  You ll be back at it soon   because I ll never be  back at it   I m not going to be running a crew and crossing oceans and I just can t bring myself to do more than smile and wave them off as they leave  I m working part time in a sail loft so people I knew from the yachting industry I tend to see a few times a year when they bring sails to be repaired after or looked over before an Atlantic crossing Oh that has real potential for fun  I m sure I ll have ample opportunity to play with that probably tomorrow    The What Happened To You  What s Wrong With You question is the worst A few years ago a guy walked up to me at a conference and did the WHTY and I asked   what makes you think it s okay to demand that a perfect stranger tell you about the worst day of their life  This 100   I just don t think they realize how cringey it is like I understand that they re trying to relate but the experience they might have had is usually so anecdotal by comparison  I rather you just come up to me and ask what happened than being stared at any day   True  The staring is a lot worse  I m not sure I ll ever grow a thick enough skin to completely shake how self conscious it makes me feel Assistive equipment brands 1   get an industrial sewing machine 2   make your own products 3   please please sell them to me in the USA I would totally buy them I m disallowed from buying from overseas so I have to get them thru a third party who marks them up even more     Man if I could I would I m pretty crafty  knitting crochet cross stitch etc  but for some reason I suck at sewing Also post injury I m the only one working in the house so a labor intensive side gig isn t exactly gonna work for my schedule at the moment Besides some of those products are metal or plastic and would require actual engineering skills which I most certainly lack   If you don t mind me asking why are you disallowed from buying overseas C5 C6 anterior and posterior fusionHi Is this around the time of year that you had your accident u thesaunders There are so many of us that have this issue for so many different reasons   Feel free to message me if you want need to talk I am a C 6 quad incomplete but I was born this way  I have also had my spinal cord tether itself to the inner wall of my spinal column  dura  twice I am married and I have a son that is going to be 30 yrs old in June of next year  I m 4 years out from my injury  c1 c3 7 incomplete and now fused c1 c7  I know the feeling asI shared similar sentiments for a time My 4 year mark just passed in August and it was more of a day of celebration for me Over the years I have went from resentful of my injury to thankful for the life I ve been given It has no doubt changed me physically but also mentally I am a much nicer cooler more calm person now I am far more patient  some would say I am still impatient though  Think of it not so much as a sad day where your life as you knew it ended but more so a new day where a new chapter of your journey began   If you want feel free to message me to talk in more detail  thank you kind personMerci PabroHey I see your fused at a high level I m fused c4 to t3     x200B   Wondering how difficult your neck movement is due to the fusionMen with sci having sexI definitely have the same feelings sometimes I ve found that being super open and communicative helps   Look at it as an opportunity to up your oral game Ask her exactly what she likes and have her guide you Everyone likes different things so talking about it is key My bad if this is too much but this has been my approach The fact that you re in a relationship with someone already is a big advantage  I am with a guy who is a c5 Best sex I ve ever had Probably because we love each other a lot and most of the sex I ve had before wasn t as loving or as comfortable I do not miss sex with other men at all Also he goes down on me way longer and he s the first guy to ever make me cum  I went through a few years of feeling the exact way for the most part The sex isn t everything but it kinda was a big part of our lives before my accident We would try after but it often left me disappointed because it was short lived As other people have already mentioned oral sex and foreplay does help the overall experience I take Viagra and smoke some weed before and that has made sex for us a 1000  better in my opinion I used to get frustrated because my erection would go away after a few minutes but the Viagra gives me an erection for at least 20 30 minutes Also we use a vibrating cock ring to help her orgasm then we finish me off with a Hitachi wand So we are both satisfied like the good ole days Sadly the sex almost feels like a routine and doesn t feel spontaneous With that being said I would gladly take this sex life over the years of frustration after my accident It took me at least 5 6 years to find my groove with my wife and we are slowly finding new ways to keep it going  I am literally in the same situation My partner says it doesn t matter but it definitely matters to me   Edit  clarification below Hey man C6 here I know the feeling I don t even have anyone to experiment with though so I envy you    This post hit very very close to home for me Although I feel that i should preface this with saying I am an S1 incomplete so I consider myself rather lucky in some ways Regardless I had a really hard time with this exact thing for a few years after a wreck I was in I had a fiancee at the time and I realized a few weeks after wajing up in the hospital that I had an issue with sexual function I got very lucky that I had a significant other that I d been with for a couple years at the time of the wreck There was very aggressive amount if self loathing self deprecation and self pity Which is very much so a self destructive behavior that hurts not only you but your partner as well VED  medical penis pump  devices were very painful and not worth it Cialis didn t work and Viagra doesn t work quite the way it should and I was overcome by this insecurity of my beautiful redhead wife could easily just leave me and get some non cripple able dicked guy to get plowed by She always complimented me and tried to keep me positive and would do anything she could sexually to try and help When trying Viagra and seeing how it doesn t work exactly as described I just made it worse by overthinking and feeling ashamed Which would make me so limp and opposite of turned on you wouldn t have even believed I took one I thought she would for sure leave me for a dude with a rock solid hog It took me a while to go from  Oh god poor girl has to try and do something with my half mast shame cock  to  my shit don t even work as well as it should and she s STILL gettin after it  and now it s more of a turn on than anything aside from the frustration It can be hard but finding someone  especially  THE  one  makes a big difference because after awhile you don t feel so insecure and you know they aren t there just for your dick and balls and you are much more comfortable ans confident which in turn will stiffen your member since you will not have boner killing anxiety or insecurity Your SO is there for you not what used to be you but you in this moment Try your best to stay confident because girls will be less inclined to stick it out through the rough parts if you don t have confidence and dignity left The mosr important things my therapist mentioned to me were the keeping as much confidence as you can even though it can be extremely tough and remember the things you can do and learn to be a master at what you still can do You re girl doesn t want another vagina in bed with her at night  Referring to you  Sorry for the novel DM me if you wanna chat My normal sex life is no more For instance I can t go down on a girl anymore I can t go at it for nearly as long and I ve made my back pain a lot worse by trying anyways   In my experience my back pain has severely limited and changed my sex life It s just another sad fact of back pain imo and ime  This is just one of a dozen or so things I used to love to do that simply aren t possible and def arent enjoyable anymore  I can tell you I have done some research after my injury Both online and with myself My situation seems to be one of the worse case variety I have very little feeling anymore and haven t had an erection since I have tried vibrators to no avail Haven t tried drugs yet looking into it I can t seem to get aroused mentally either And I don t get sleep erections either  The good bad thing is I m not horny I just don t feel any kind of sexual feeling or emotions Porn or erotic stories give no effect I would say I m asexual now except mentally I still appreciate women and want to have an emotional relationship Physical interaction like cuddling and even giving oral would be within my ability but I m not lusting after every woman I see It seems I need and it would require from any potential mate a more emotional and mental connection than today s hook up culture is up for along with a ton of patience and effort  So I am sad about my lack of ability but not terrible emotional My feelings and worries center more around not feeling worth all that I require in return Heck a year later and I m still in a nursing facility looking for a place to live  I know how you feel  I ve considered adding a third for her satisfaction  u cazem1234 Ya we re super open and communicative so we re both on the same page and my oral game is on point lol  it s just all the other stuff I m hung up on Definitely thankful I m with her as well so I m thankful deleted Was it hard for him to believe

dispensary works Thank you for the recommendation does your daughter have similar symptoms or have the same diagnosis Control Robotic Arms with Your FaceHi     x200B   I created this technology and will soon upload videos on how it can be made at home  Paired with a decent robotic arm you can easily control it or other electronic devices  The sensor is user friendly and does not interfere with talking eating etc  Does anyone else only get bladder issues as the day goes on I m actually the opposite It s most difficult for me to do that in the morning but gets easier as the day goes on   It gets easier sometimes and harder others for no real reason it seems but I have noticed that typically it is more difficult when I m dehydrated The more hydrated I am the more consistent it is  I have the issue  with both bladder and bowels that I can t feel it until it s almost time to have an accident   Luckily at my job I am free to move around and leave my desk whenever so I can rush away of needed   deleted  I constantly feel this way I will think I need to go and then sit there for ten minutes with nothing Then I get 90 seconds of warning before I have an accident  Same for my BF L1 injury During the night morning it s very difficult Same for me  incomplete cauda equinaSame by bladder feels like it goes from 0 100 real quick I m starting to wonder if it s meds I take  Like

m getting a better wheelchair Looks like I ll be needing itIt turns out I have spina bifida and this is probably as good as it ll get for me he said He doesn t want to operate now and doesn t want to operate unless the cyst gets significantly bigger He said that the risks outweigh the benefits   So me and my wheelchair will likely be lifelong friends now and he wants me to be as active as possible with the adaptive sports I do That was my recommendation   23 years to diagnose Spina Bifida of a moderate complexity A  birth  defect What the hell is wrong with medicine   I accept the plan

new motivation after depression I don t believe  University is useless bro   Not only can it aid in getting your career started helping you find a career you can do from a chair if needed it can return you to a sense of normalcy that you haven t had in a year Also it can provide a sense of community and socialization that you have been lacking since your injury and maybe your sense of isolation and loneliness will lift when you get around other people   Tough love  your brother is not the best decision maker seems like so I would not rely on him to give you sound advice on your future   Also re  self hate You can t change what s happened or go back and make a different decision on that day but you can learn from it and hopefully gain some insight and help other in the future who might be struggling with similar issues As you continue to travel this path remember that you have something valuable to provide   Get out there keep it up I ll be cheering you on    should i go back to university   Yes   Your body may be damaged but your mind isn t Make the best possible use of it   And creating a startup has better chances if you have more knowledge of either the business or the technical side  I was injured almost four years ago  I m 25 now  and I took a year away from university after my accident but going back and finishing my degree  in English  was one of the best decisions of my life  I definitely considered dropping out altogether and I dealt with a lot of the same emotions during that year  loneliness inadequacy depression  but going back to school gave me a real drive and purpose to move forward with my life  I found that i made new friends and the profs were super supportive and being in that environment really helped me feel less lonely and isolated it gave me a goal to work towards and an achievement to celebrate and build from when I finished  Having that foundation now has opened so many new doors and opportunities that I can pursue  It has helped shape my outlook on life to be more positive I totally understand that the university experience is different for everyone so what I experienced might not be the same for you but my advice would be to set a goal which requires you to go outside of your comfort zone something to work towards and celebrate when you achieve it then set a new goal  I think the worst thing we can do to ourselves is spin our wheels  figuratively  not doing anything with real drive or purpose  I ve definitely had moments when I sort of fell back into that trap and it required a real effort to get out of it  hey thanks for the support man sounds like a good plan thanks for the advice hailey 4 months post op from a 12cm sacral meningocele just brought home my latest MRI disk and it looks like half

last year  It s the only med I ve found effective  Tumeric cream and CBD help the sciatica I get in my ankles due to a botched surgery to fix drop foot Do you get a compression feeling in the knees and top of the thigh All mine is on one side It s still really messing with my life   Over 15 yrs after the surgery   I also use benzos but sparingly mostly for anxious causing social engagements Family being by far the worst   I also walk often otherwise my legs ache more However when I do walk I get increased sciatica   By far the best help I ve gotten for my back has been the chiropractor but it took aong time until I found one good enough Hope ur finding relief peace  I m down to solpadol 30 500 when needed   considering I was on fentanyl before I m pleased with the progression thus far No nerve pain meds I just deal with the nerve pain for now   Might want to look into this  https   www reddit com r Drugs comments dt0jjp kratom_killed_my_brothers_friend    Not to say that you shouldn t take kratom but it might be best to take breaks in between uses This will also help with tolerance buildup and hopefully prevent you from experiencing withdrawals While kratom is nowhere near as powerful or addictive as most pharmaceutical opiods you can most definitely still have more than uncomfortable withdrawals  For me personally   The first year I was all kinds of fucked up lots of crying and insomnia I did 4 rounds of epidural steroid injections both in my back and S  joint I took meloxicam and Flexeril and briefly took Tramadol with those and felt little difference   I m in my 3rd year post and I am currently on no pain medications or muscle relaxers I am doing pretty well use my TENS until often I really got a push to stop meds because my duodenum perforated this summer so no more NSAIDS for me   Everyone is different good luck  So exactI tried so many CBD products which did absolutely nothing  Valium gives some relief also xan but i try to stay away from it And yes my fucking hip bone and knee crack and pop it s loud as fuck  Thanks for responding and likewise sciatica is hell word  My nerve pain is awful Why you gotta put that here we all know kratom kills nobody I need a tens unit but I m semi nomadic so it s virtually impossible to carry around with me in my backpackBotox for muscle stiffness in legsI get botox in my feet and calves regularly and I love it The shots in the feet really hurt but it s 100  worth it to me because it improves my gait and my day to day comfort  I m a C5 walking quad and high have a lot of tone in my left quadriceps and calf I had some of the same issues I was getting it and it definitely helped calm down the tone It s hard to say if it helped with my gait because I ve been doing a lot of physical therapy concurrently I decided to not do it after this most recent three months to see what it would be like going back to no Botox because ideally I don t want to have injections every three months for the rest of my life It will most likely take a couple rounds for them to dial the proper dosage as they start off conservatively How long has it been since your injury  Major props for keeping at it on your own From what you described it sounds like it d help My quads get set off when I go to stand up and I would fall back before so it helped in that case I would ask your physiatrist what he she thinks considering they re the one who s going to give you the injections  When walking it s hard to get full range of motion due to leg my leg tightness so really seeking some type of relief that will allow me to stretch it I been injured since 2011  My ability to walk with no assistance confidently has come about within the last year or so just dialed up my work in the gym Traditional therapy just doesn t improve anything for me anymore   Now that my walking speed had increased the tone in my right leg mainly my hamstrings is only thing stopping the putting my recovery at a stand still and I would to be able to get up from a chair without my legs muscles fighting mebladder botoxthe actual best decision one with a spinal cord injury can make Congrats It s truly life changing  I had an Interstim implanted in my spine to help with urine retention I feel like it works but I still have times where I need to cath I wonder if I can get a Botox injection as well  Congrats man  looking back at posts and wondering if you found any info on botox for you   Is so much of a life change both for knowledge about my body and how to take better care of myself  and the convenience of not having to wear a condom cath and a leg bag is so much more than I was ever hoping for  I just wanted to stop leaking and the results so far are kind of beyond belief   I keep expecting to see or feel a wet spot every day and not yet  this is so goodEase of Access Survey for a School ProjectHas anyone been to Farnum spinal injury rehabilitation in Keene New Hampshire Sharing my story deleted  Stoked to hear your recovery is going well It sounds like you re putting in the hard work it takes Everyone who s gone through this will tell you put in as much as you can early in as that s when you see the most recovery I m about a year out from my injury and I m also C5 incomplete I use a hiking stick but I wear an AFO on my left leg My left hand has limited function I ve recently gone back to therapy to keep working on my recovery If you ever feel like chatting feel free to PM me  Thanks so much for the motivation I m still in the hospital after an operation for spinal stenosis  I m still battling an infection but the plan is that I go to an acute rehab facility specializing in spinal injuries after this  Manybqyears prior I developed a nerve disorder called syringomyelia  So I was walking with either a cane or a walker for the past 15 years anyway  Right now I m contemplating a life of never being able to stand or walk again not being able to control my bladder or bowels and not being able to feel anything in my groin at all   Hearing that you were able to make the changes you made gives me motivation and hope in the future   Good luck in your continuing journey Great news buddy  Awesome to hear man When I had my injury the doctors said my past life as a weightlifter probably saved my life It is a crazy feeling from lifting big weights above your head in a split second to learning how to walk again Kudos to you on the positive attitude and best of luck in your recovery Feel free to message me if you ever need anything  As a C5 I m insanely jealous but always hyped to hear people who are able to make gains Keep on going man  This is the first story I have read on Reddit  never really checked this app out until I trying to distract myself while riding with my husband to pick up some things I get a little bit of anxiety as the passenger  Your injuries are very similar to mine and even the length of time in therapy  I have a C3 C5 fusion with incomplete SCI  ASIA D  and a brain injury The accident was also in July like yours  the 26th  The driver and I were drinking and ended up going head on into a 15 ft ditch at 65mph I was in the car with him for a 1 4 mile and had not gotten my seatbelt buckled  it was so close to being clipped  Airbag did me no good because the nose of the vehicle when down a little so I went up above it  It actually fractured my tibial The driver tried to get me out of the truck and ended up ripping on my right arm so hard it caused a lot of nerve damage I couldn t move it or even touch it  The therapy I went through did help but the thing that really really benefitted me   massage therapy   That is the reason for all my ROM back in my right arm  It was so painful at times but well worth it  The road to recovery never ends and it is a heck of a hill to climb I give you a giant applause for your great strength and meeting goals  you were very lucky Great story  Walking as a C 7 injury fused from C 4 to T 3  Had docs n therapist tell me I ll never walk but I didn t let it stop my motivation   I didn t recovery as quick as you did took years to be able to use a crutch confidently and now I walk with no assistance unless it a pretty long walk somewhere   To anyone with SCI I always say stay motivated workout daily if possible and Keep a positive mindset Such an encouraging story thank you for sharing  My mom has been at the Vallejo KFRC for just over a week now Fell down some stairs broke her neck Level C6 and ASIA C when she was admitted to Vallejo But  she also broke her wrist And with that she can t do any weight bearing exercises PT has been mostly teaching the family how to do her stretches and lifts for sending her home next week     which feels absurdly early Everyone has been raving about how wonderful the facility is and we absolutely adore the nurses and therapists but it also feels extremely chaotic and out of control schedule wise with how short staffed they often are and they just aren t working her at all Do you have any suggestions on how to get more consistent care and learning while at KFRC I m worried that my mom was expecting to get a workout but with the additional broken arm she feels that her therapists have given up on her We need a little bit of hope that she can still make progress after the arm has healed It s a scary time Thank you for reading best wishes to you  It really does bring back feeling sensation  Oh my goodness it would have such an itchy feeling  It s a crazy story of who my therapist was  she happened to be the ex wife of a very great friend and at one point my fianc   he actually passed the February before my car accident He was in the army as a paratrooper and suffered from a brain injury from an IUD and major PTSD from tours in Iraq He was very important to me and I was just as important to him Out of the blue I googled massage and chiropractor had my first appointment thought she looked familiar actually talked all out the man  and it was her  I was so embarrassed lol cried next time I went in there but this woman had the magic hands  I couldn t even touch my own arm the air on it hurt too anything made me cringe Her hands did not bother it at all   The atmosphere and connection was unexplainable  Not only was it message  it was emotional psychological and  soul food   I was seeing her 3x week and made awesome progress   I have her notes from appointments and she noted when I put my hair in ponytail for the first time  3  My accident was in 2012 and was doing great walking was so so difficult but I had my mind set  I struggle A LOT with my mind I have regressed in ROM and have lost a bit of weight which I can t seem to gain back My biggest issue was all the meds I was taking so I weened myself of them  Norco fentonal cymbalta nuecenta methadone total of 12 15 at once   My hypotension blood pressure is a pain but I started them meds again I know I will have to take some of them but I don t want to be a zombie or sleep all the time like I was I have been depressed and it s embarrassing and hard to explain to people that I really am handicapped  I don t look like it  The pain is never going to go away and life always throws me more than I feel I can handle  I m searching for the me that left the rehabilitation center to go home  on the anniversary of my fathers death  Over all my recovery has been great  I am so grateful for everything and everyone  Even the pain   I continue to educate myself on the brain and spinal cord which helps me  I m not sure if my husband understands what I need from him   Support understanding and patience  We married last year and it s been tough Fingers crossed that we can get through this  What year was your accident Have you found anything that helps with nerves  I was ASIA C and am between D and EThat s awesome Glad you re with hiking sticks  the AFO was a nuisance for me when putting my shoes on  I worked hard to strengthen my hamstring and glutes to get away from the AFO   I ll PM you soon I wish you nothing but the best I m happy to have provided motivation  don t lose it even on those difficult days Just know frustrations are normal  that s what my therapists said When did your recovery begin Thanks for reading my story I absolutely believe the massages my mom gave on my arms and legs helped bring back sensation and movement   How is your recovery going Happy to hear that you didn t lose motivation and you re walking again The weight bearing seems normal I was like that for a few weeks I can t imagine they re sending her home because of the one wrist  I would definitely speak to your case manager and supervising therapist   I know the consensus is generally if there is no advancement they send patients home however I would suggest stating that there isn t improvement because of the lack of staff Keep pushing   How is her ability of catheterization That was a big part of how I was extended an additional week  seems absurd but my supervising PT told me to get that done for extended stay  he was very helpful  I also want to mention massage My mom had massages my legs arms and hands every single day I believe that was big contributor to gaining sensation and basic movement  nothing fancy and no deep tissue I completely understand the embarrassing feeling however my friends family and strangers don t see it that way I ve never had such positivity surrounding me with the disability I get nervous shaking other people s hands because my pinky doesn t work and the fingers are a bit slow but no one seems to care  it s quite emotionally relieving   Cold is the only thing that triggers my nerves and that s only in my feet I don t have nerve pain anymore and I m off my meds Massage was the best cure when my nerves were over firing   Don t lose hope and keep working towards your goals Tips on temperature regulation Keep your head covered and you warm buy some kind of heat trapping hat and scarf it tricks your body into thinking it s warm I think  works for me Just be careful with the heating blanket Definitely do a test even on setting 1 I have a spinal cord injury as well 2 nights ago I fell asleep on a heating pad I woke up with a massive burn that has already badly blistered  I use a high TOG rated duvet in winter which is great for keeping warm when in bed   When I m in my chair I find base layer thermal tops  Merino Wool  help me to stay warm and comfortable Have you considered base layer thermal bottoms  Second what was said but I really live by a sunbeam electric blanket I got at Costco Level 1 is safe for no sensation and I use it under the duvet I also sleep with a toque in sometimes  My partner always wears socks that are long so he can pull them all the way up his shins Especially the fluffy slipper type socks  Everyone paralyzed living in a cold climate should have a top quality goose down comforter I also use a mattress warmer instead of a heated blanket The mattress warmer is turned on high 30 minutes before bed   goose down holds in heat I turn it down to low   get in it takes about 30 minutes   ice cold limbs are toasty warm then shut off mattress warmer for the night I ve used this method for over 20 yrs  When you use a heated blanket it sits on top of you   all the heat goes up in the air The rising heat from a mattress warmer works 100  better when you lock in the heat with goose down I ve never had a skin issue from the mattress warmer I use a Dyson heater There is no heat source so you can t burn yourself Also there is an app that allows you to rotate the heater set timers change from heat to cool and adjust the fan speed I have a Dyson at my office and in my room The only shitty thing is they are around  500 a piece At this point in my life feeling warm and comfortable is a priority for me and something I m willing to spend money on   To add in the summer I can sit under the sun for 30 minutes to an hour and be hot all day It s the best thing ever Wondering if anyone else has this similar effect when it comes to sunlight and if so I would love to hear a way to artificially produce sunlight  I m not handicapped so can t be sure this would be relevant   It happens I have trouble with dry air so use a boiling water humidifier in my bedroom  door closed to keep humidity in the one room   I run it from a timer that lets it steam and go off in alternate 15 minute intervals   I find the humidifier greatly increases the apparent warmth of the room  Some of this is actual heat but some of it is due to the increased humidity  In any event the room feels warmer   I realize this could be difficult for a handicapped person to set up and maintain but maybe others can find work arounds for that  I used a hat the other night and that worked pretty well I ll try a scarf tonight and see how it goes Yeah that s what my rehab people talked about so I m wary about themnever never sleep ON a heat source I think in general we are right to be very cautious around heating pads and blankets I d love to put mine under the fitted sheet so I could just get the warmth without tangling in the cord but that s the fastest way to burn yourself   the weight of your body holding your skin against the heat means that it can t dissipate and you get the full intensity of the heat on your skin Hope you get some good wound care and it heals up quick I actually just got a pair of them the other day and they are the best thing for keeping my legs away from just being blocks of ice High TOG duvet is a good shout as well I ll look into getting one cheers   Oh cool I never knew what levels were safe for no sensation and my rehab team were just dead set against using an electric blanket at all because of potentially having it on too high I forgot about those socks I ll get some thanks   That makes sense   I ll have to look into getting one next month when I get paid Ice cold limbs really suck and trying to manage it is really difficult the rising heat thing makes more sense to me than the electric blanket because it s turned off after it heats you up Goose locks in heat better as well so yeah thanks for this   How does a mattress warmer work it s not just a blanket under the fitted sheet Man that sounds like a great idea but I can barely make rent nvm  500 for an amazing heater Though I ll keep it in mind if I ever do have the money because   I mean take last night  it hit   5 again and my draft exclusion really sucks and even with all the tips here  bar electric blanket bcause I can t afford it  I woke up with legs and arms like blocks of ice Thankfully my room mate put the heating on really high and everything sort of thawed but I m so tired from obviously really bad sleeping   Winter sucks so muchAny tips on avoiding UTIsDrink primarily water and plenty of it at least two liters per day Take care to clean very carefully  front to rear  before cathing and make sure you are emptying your bladder completely  Residual urine is a breeding ground for infections   wash your hands use WetOnes on your pee hole before inserting the catheter  D mannose with cranberry pills Plenty of water and drain your bladder between 300 500ml ideally Drink extra water if you ever drink soda or alcohol If you have an SP make sure it s Always below bladder so gravity drains it properly  Cranberry tablets help me a lot  Need more information What does your routine look like  Apple cider vinegar is what works best for me D Mannose if I need a little added help every couple of months or so Try Ellura Cranberry supplements Buy directly from the company They are pricey but my husband who is a t 5 para has not had a UTI since he started using these in March Prior to that he had constant UTI s despite drinking tons of water and taking cranberry supplements and d mannose If his urine does get cloudy he doubles up on the ellura for a day or so Recommended by his urologist  How do you take the ACV and how much How do you figure out what is wrong with you Check for broken toes ingrown toenails and flush or change cath Could be you need a bowel program from not drinking enough water and r backed up Drink mag citrate and clear you out     x200B   It s hard to find a doc that even knows what AD is so usually u need to educate them  Do you see a neurosurgeon at all Outside of a general practitioner PCP I think its helpful to talk to one or be familiar with one who knows your specific case In my experience they have had a better understanding about the issues a person with an SCI might face   How do you figure out what is wrong with you   A neurologist ordered a full body MRI that MRI revealed a syrinx From there he was not too great on dealing with what I had so I moved to other neurologists and consulted with neurosurgeons I had terrible luck with my general practitioner and was misdiagnosed with no MRI initially  This exactly I hope OP has already checked the  usual suspects  but it s worth checking every one of them if your usual triggers don t seem to be the issue and try to treat or remove the stimuli      skin   wounds injuries inflammation rashes pinched skin tight clothing Check your seating pockets etc as u numbthumbs suggested Check your feet and have someone check areas of your body you can t see or feel Look for ingrown toenails broken toes and I d add athlete s foot fungal skin infections in your feet or genital area could easily trigger AD and be somewhat hard to spot These would need treatment over time but reducing the inflammation and  pain  you can t feel that it might be causing would probably help resolve the AD within a day or two Check or have someone check your wheelchair seating and anything else you regularly sit on   your commode chair or raised toilet seat for example Is there something broken or sticking out that you can t feel when you re on it that might be triggering AD      bladder  kidney stones UTI kinked catheter tubing misplaced catheters   given OP has an SP catheter I d also suggest a urology appointment for cystoscopy to check that there aren t any anomalies in the bladder or stoma and try using a narrower gauge SP Cath in case it s a stoma issue I have two friends who had AD triggered by bladder cancer      bowel  beyond regular issues with bowel management like constipation and impaction  anal fissures or hemmorrhoids can cause AD but you d know it because the AD would be triggered more during and after a bowel movement try using lidocaine lube 10 mins before your bowel program It s conceivable that you could get AD as a result of gallstone pain heartburn or gas too but much more rare      Sex reproduction  pinched genitals sexual activity pregnancy contractions and childbirth can all cause AD      bones  check your bones and joints below your injury level for signs of inflammation injury swelling hips in particular to see if there s any loss of range of motion that might mean heterotopic ossification  HO  an SCI related overgrowth of bone around joints most often at the hip You could have an asymptomatic dislocation or even just arthritic changes in your joints      in women  remove the IUD or tampon if there s one in place Menstruation can also be a cause of AD ovarian cysts etc   One way to think about it is to start with the main SCI complications like Bowel bladder pain skin seating and mobility then once you ve checked that nothing is unusual in any of those areas zoom out to think about what are the common health complaints of someone your age that you may be unlikely to feel below your injury level  arthritis pain in your joints gallbladder GERD ovarian cysts etc   It s important to note that for a small number of people with AD they are never able to remove every trigger and so the goal switches to managing the risks by using medications to control BP I ve also heard that regular physical activity is also known to reduce severity of AD over time for people who can t identify all triggers and remove the stimuli I do not I think I had one during my inpatient therapy but have not spoken to one since I left about 12 years agoAny musicians here Like  u Bad_MoonRising I too used to be a drummer I still am at heart but playing the kit just isn t the same But Don t give up Get yourself a music rig a DAW  Digital Audio Workstation  a handful of VSTs  Virtual Instruments  and learn how to create via computer Yeah it s not the same But it can be incredibly satisfying Especially if you ve got tunes in your head and just need a way to express them Hell most of the music you hear these days is heavily reliant on computer  from creation to production  Plus with VSTs you have access to pretty much every instrument you can think of I love doing it and would be happy to offer whatever help I can if you re interested PM me or I m always hanging out on our  discord  https   discord gg FVXQGKD  if you want to chat  Harmonica  if you played punk then you may like ska in which case you can follow the horn line or keep up with the main melody plus it exercises the lips which make you a better lover     Look into different keys and manufacturers I prefer Lee Oscar I used to play drums I know how you feel  Dunno how much motor function you have but steel lap slide guitar might help scratch some of the itch I have one good side  that includes one good hand  but I finally picked up choir singing a few years ago and should have done much sooner  drummer and bass player here  DAW with some practice and creativity could possibly scratch the creative itch   Ableton is great for creating   works with Mac OS or Windows  I am a Mac user so I use Logic  but midi and samples can be coaxed into

play some really basic chords on the guitar   like C G   nothing barred but I ll take what I can get I still play I just am learning to play really differently than before  I play banjo but not very well  Have you tried playing slide I would think it would check allot of the boxes of self expression and skill progression Let me know if you give it a try I know being able to play around with my bass has been great even if its just with 1 finger at a time  C7 8   Link to a quad jamming out on a slide  The video is just a slide show but shows lots of good pictures of the dudes set up     https

whistling was a regular part of some repertoire  You need no instrument at all but you do have to develop your embouchure  big word of the day     The use of the  lips  https   en wiktionary org wiki

t perform publicly but greatly enjoy it privately  I play the drums still but I had to adapt my kit obvs  I ve got the kick vertical now  my boyfriend helped me install legs on it  and I use multi sticks with mallets on the back end though the high hats are pretty much a write off at this point  Have you heard of Jason Gerling  He s a C6 C7 incomplete and he developed a pretty incredible system to allow him to continue drumming  Electronic music might also help fill the void  starting to stressI know nothing about bladder Botox but dude have a chat with your doctor and ask these questions They will put your fears at ease If this was going to hurt you then it would not be recommended surely Forgive me if I am explaining anything that you know already   Your bladder is a muscle Think of it as a stretchy bag But it only holds so much and then the bag leaks The Botox will relax the walls of your bladder so it will hold more urine and not leak So the bag won t become bigger but it ll stretch more before it starts to overflow   In your past posts you ve talked about how you are leaking a lot The Botox will help you not to leak so much between caths   But I m confused by your post I m not sure I understand what you are doing Are you saying you just wear a condom cath and then cath yourself for residual urine If so then I confess I don t get why you re getting Botox because technically you re always leaking  unless you re having pain    If the goal is for you to be able to straight cath yourself every few hours then you should set a schedule for yourself If you drink more than normal cath sooner   And no your bladder won t explode You ll leak or the urine will back up into your kidneys  this is not good    But if you re nervous talk to your doctor If you re not 100  understanding what will happen then you don t have full informed consent and you don t need to proceed  No need to worry  had it done numerous times   it doesn t always work  it depends if the botox is injected in the exact right area   also depends the amount of botox used You might not see a big difference   if it relaxes bladder to much you can still press on your bladder   push out urine every 3 4 hrs It has NO affect on bowel care Also   you shouldn t loose sensation when you have to go it should just help you hold it til you can cath and or minimize any leaking  So  did you have the Botox How s it going so far   deleted  everthing in life can hurt ya if ya don t know how to deal with it and I have no support at home I am all alone and an hour away from anything close to help  This web site is my only communication unless I am in the doctor office for a scheduled appt and that takes forever  Thanks for the the time it took to read and write to my postI used to trust doctors like ya say until I found out I was not given info I didn t know how to ask for but was put threw unneeded surgery by a urologist who was suppose to be a good doctor and now I have no recorse and am not any better for trusting himright now I cath 6 10 times a day and still piss my pants in between The goal is to cath less and stay dry in between I thank you for this info  I am alone 98  of my life and the mind goes crazy I live in a very populated place  not much opportunity to talk to doctor unless I wait 3 4 weeks between talks and this is a very touchy subject for me  THANK YOUthank you this is what I was asking  I am alone with no one to talk to and cannot get ahold of the doctor Gonna try again tomorrow  When the doctor said i was perfect candidate for botox he new I was talkin to people on the internet so he didn t really say much  Talking to you guys is why I have this urologist and why I new he was sending me to the right tests to find out about my bladder   This is hopefully goin to be a life changeing this for the better  I have been pissing my pants for 31 yrs and I am so sick of not having the latest info  I appreciate all the help I can get THANK YOUthat  s the first time I heard that  I have only heard ya lose all sensation  It s hard to tell what it means anyway but I heardd it all goes awayI had botox injections 7 days ago and today it started working  a little this morning and more as the day went on  It is so awesome to take a 2 1 2 hour nap without a condom catheter on and wake up dry  that has not happened to me even with a condom on more than a couple of times in 30 yrs  I am so excited I just want to show off my dry pants  ha ha haIt is the 7th day after today and my bladder is holding almost 100ml more and more all time  It is doing it a little at a time with less leakage all the time  I am so excited to be able to go without external coverage and when covered and leaks it is not enough to make the catheter leak  this is so awesomebotox in sphincterI m a T12 paraplegic I believe that botox injections is one of the best things since sliced bread that and CBD oil  deleted  Are you sure it s in the sphincter not detrusor muscle What did the urodynamics study show  The tube through the belly button is a suprapubic catheter  So the botox makes you completely incontient and you don t have to cath at all C2 C4 Tumor SurgeryI am sorry you are going through this     Not the outcome I was expecting Wondering if this is a common outcome that I was not prepped for   Definitely not The neurosurgeons should take care not to cause damage to the spinal cord during the operation   even if it means leaving bits of the tumor behind     Also wondering if it is standard practice to have a Certified Neurophysiological Technologist present during this type of surgery   Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is the standard during spinal cord surgery today at least in countries with sane healthcare systems It basically gives the surgeon the information if it is safe to remove certain bits or if they contain healthy neurons and removing them will cause permanent neurological deficits   Have you talked to a lawyer yet I am not very litigious but this sounds like a case where suing for damages might be appropriate    C4ish C7 spinal cord tumor here mostly untouched because the surgeon considered removal too dangerous    Not a standard outcome no You should have been informed about the fact that there was a risk of it or other deficits just because of the nature of the surgery That absolutely should have been done before you signed any consent forms because you re not just giving consent you re supposed to be giving  informed  consent   While not nearly the same situation as yours I went in a surgery on my lower spinal cord just over three years ago expecting to come out feeling and doing better after recovering Instead I cane out with a lot of new pain and enough damage that I m classified as an incomplete paraplegic at this point  I use a chair  While it was and still is difficult to accept this outcome I went into surgery fully aware that this risk existed   As far as whether things improve after two years I think it depends on what you mean by that Are you to wake up one day and everything is going to go back to normal No But can you work with what you have to optimize what you re capable of and increase your independence Yes Over 3 years out and I m still learning news tricks that make my life easier I found it helped my mental health when I switched my definition of  better  from being able to walk getting rid of the pain etc to learning how to make the best of what I do have  T11 L3 fusionGlad you re here Share anything Ask anything  I can walk also but I m a c3 c4 I dont look any different but I am  I feel your pain  Im still in the early stages of my SCI  3 mths  and it s a little hard to relate to L2 injury fusion because I don t know many people who are walkers It s nice to know that there are others out there who know what I m going through Have a lot of questions but generally no answers  Hi going through have a lot of questions but generally no answers  I m dad Hi my boyfriend is an L1 walker   6 months in Pain Meds OpioidsHow long have you been injured Pain can take years to subside though may never really go away   Are there alternative medicines on offer You may need to experiment a bit to find what works for you   Have you tried taking a break from opiates I m not sure  not a doctor  but efficacy might decrease over time as tolerance increases   Opiates are a terrible drug they never sat well with me and I preferred to be in pain off them but if they work for you and it s what you need I m not sure what can be said to help  Are you having physical or nerve pain  Hi there Are you under the care of a pain specialist If not you should seek a pain specialist cause they can manage your pain much better than your primary care Dr Also you mentioned that sometimes you take more that what is prescribed so you run out of meds early This is not a good thing as they will label you as a drug abuser I know cause im a pharmacist I recommend that you talk to your dr and increase your norco 5 to norco 10 or maybe even percocet if your current dose is not working for you   As for alternative medication look into kratom Ive heard a lot of good stories about kratom for treating pain However keep in mind that it has the potential for addiction dependence just like opiods but in my opinion thats better than being on opiods  I was prescribed tramadol which was effective It s not known for having the euphoric side effect so it s less likely to be abused Maybe your doctor would be more open to give you a significant dosage The problem with pain meds opioids is that you build a tolerance quickly so they become less effective very quickly  Figuring out if it s nerve pain or physical pain seems crucial Like someone else recommended a pain specialist is going to be able to help you more than anyone I m sorry to hear you re suffering Stay strong  I wonder if you re a candidate for epidural stimulation They re being used in SCI research but they were originally designed for pain management I believe  Try acupuncture Find a licensed MD who also practices it It helped me get off Narco after my SCI yeh drs can hurt as much as help not all drs like this but i have found quite a bit in my home town that labeled EVERYONE as pill pusher that came to ER you have to be careful what you tell them or get labeled and never get help again it will be  you just want pills  and do nothing not believing your complaints of pain  I have been injured for almost 5 years and 3 months after my injury I realized how high the climb would be until my pain was properly managed The only insurance approved provider in my area is a bag of dicks They service 3 countys treat everyone like a number and treat everyone like a drug addict They have made my mother cry on 3 different occasions for things out of her control So I said fuck that place I d find a PCP that was ok with writing prescriptions for pain medicine This wasn t easy but eventually I found a doctor who wrote norco 10 s 4x a day This still wouldn t relieve me of my pain but I was on the right track I went to her for half a year with her saying each month that it was the last month and I would be referred to the shithole pain clinic I described I explained to her my feelings each time so she took care of me Then she retired   FUCK So I started my search again Then luck happened for me I had shingles It doesn t sound like luck but they were giving me 2mg dilaudid every 4 hours in the hospital When I left they wrote for perc 10s instead of norco This helped a lot more I was able to finally be active but once the script ran out I had to find another refill Luckily A pain clinic opened in my home town and I started there Same script obvious pill mill vibes I mean straight drug dealer doctor who charged out the ass but all I needed was one prescription because I get my meds mailed to me and they can do up to 6 months if the doctor will write it He hooked up the order with the company and when they arrived they were oxy 15s These have been and still are the best for my pain Any more and I feel buzzed but 15 stops my pain and allows me to be a better father and person in general I also noticed he had upped my dose from 4 times a day to 6 So 15 mg every 4 hours It s been this way since january and I for the first time in forever Im starting to build a life again I am sorry about your troubles and wish you the best  Hey thanks for the reply It s been almost 2 years now I ve talked to chiropractors and worked on posture and stretching techniques I ve tried things like CBD oil As well as marijuana but that just sort of heightens it I ve done steroid injections I do physical and occupational therapy My gabapentin alone isn t enough Not sure if there s much else I just know out of all of those things the narco helps the most This is really importantI assume physical I can t sit in my chair for long because my spine aches badly along my fusion I also have a really bad spot under my shoulder blade you can hear it grinding and popping with certain movements I also have a rib subluxation on the same side  I used to get really bad nerve pain where any light touch would shock me and shoot down my back As well as burning in my legs but those have largely subsided so I think my issue is more physicalTips on shoes for a new paraplegic I wear converse high tops a lot They are quite wide and a wear a size larger than I used to The higher sides help stop my ankles swelling so much Plus they actually look pretty cool too which help with feeling a bit more normal  It takes a little while to see if a shoe is fitting properly Wear a pair for about 30 minutes and the take them off to examine your feet Look for any areas that are irritated darker or red especially around bony areas Also looks for soft flexible and breathable shoes That ll help keep your feet from getting sweaty leading to skin breakdown and keep pressure off of your skin If you end up going with hard leather or similarly rigid shoes then don t wear them for long periods of time That s just some advice I ve read about before  There s a transition period for sure but you can wear most kinds of regular shoes if they fit right Pay close attention to your feet for any redness lines or marks particularly big toe heel and ankle bone Use a mirror to check your soles and undersides of toes Look for any signs of AD when you put new shoes on at first and wear shoes for short periods to start Shoe shop in your list typical time  ie my feet swell more toward the end of the day and I usually wear compression socks so I wear them when shopping and look for shoes at the end of the day  Most places will let you return or exchange if the shoes don t have signs of wear just Keep the tags or box  Regular sneakers are fine  I ve worn Reebok Puma and Nike with no problem  I didn t buy larger shoes for edema  I don t want my feet swelling so I tie them up like normal   T4 complete https   mahabis com  gclid EAIaIQobChMI4I_Ei mn5QIVFKSzCh2I2gAtEAAYASAAEgLadPD_BwE  These are soft inside and are pretty much slippers with soles made to wear outside They also have a grippy kind of thing on the heel that keeps it from sliding off your foot  which can sometimes be a frustration  Are there any shoes for the bigger footed My husband normally wears a 17  if he had to go up a size  it d be 18   Man I just wear Toms moccasins and Sperry s They don t hurt my feet or put pressure on them and they re easy to remove  Definitely take the weight of the shoes into consideration I had some Vans and boy they were heavy Made getting my feet in the car among other things more difficult I got a pair of Adidas after that they were half the weight and it made a big difference  Lookup billy footwear they re made for us  Try the Nike FlyEase line Easy on closures no laces    https   www nike com w mens flyease shoes 1eghpznik1zy7ok I wear sneakers and crocs exclusively Crocs because I live in florida but flip flops and other sandals don t stay on my feet comfortably I wear vans style shoes as my normal casual shoes and regular athletic sneakers other times  I like nike flyease but I need to replace them and I haven t been able to find my size in stock anywhere lately  any sneaker stretches pretty well so they re comfortable I used to wear high tops because my spasticity can make my ankles a little wonky but i ve gotten lazy tbh I don t ever wear dress shoes because they bother my skin too much instead I wear brown leather sneakers  even to more formal places no one questions a guy in a wheelchair  they re more cushioned and comfortable so they don t cause pressure sores or anything but they look close enough to nice shoes that I get away with it  I did fine with regular boots  1 size bigger  for years When I started getting pressure points I bought diabetic shoes  though it took some searching to find decent looking ones   My wife who is a Paraplegic in a wheelchair Is going for a hospital stay for Physical Therapy The goal is so she can not have to fight her Insurance so hard to get a fitted wheelchair that she badly needsI m sorry she has to do this BS for freaking insurance Awful  That s crazy she has to do all this hassle for just a fitted wheelchair It s like one of the most mandatory items she needs I wish the insurance was just as good in America as it is in some parts of europe  I m sorry she has to jump through the ridiculous hoops for her wheelchair On the bright side she ll end up with a nice comfy chair that she can enjoy life in I wish you both the best  Yeah it s aggravating Thank you Yeah it is ThanksThank youC5 quad complete  how to achieve orgasm releaseI ve said this in the past on this forum I m a C6 7 Quadriplegic and I use a Hitachi massager with Viagra I also noticed that weed helps me feel a little more sensitive down in that region I just press the massager on the head till I orgasm My body will usually get really stiff from spasms but it s completely normal It doesn t feel as good as it used to but still feels good in my opinion Also I usually can orgasm a couple of times to empty out  I ve had a few sexual relationships since my injury they ve all been reasonably positive experiences but it s always pretty frustrating for me as I never get to orgasm It s good to give the other person pleasure and I guess it s lucky I ve always liked going down on girls So it s good still but ultimately frustrating I tend to get bored of sex if I m having it a lot because there s really just not that much pleasure in it for me  I think you just have to be open to trying new things until you find something you enjoy or works for you  Prostate massage works for me  Pretty much the only way I can cum  T 12 L 1  I can ejaculate but have a hard time with a stiffy   thanks boner pills   I do get a  greyed out  orgasm   I milk it for all it is worth  pun intended   sex especially for a very sexually motivated person just sucks  I wish it was better for you I m a complete C5 and can t cum or really achieve any kind of sexual release It s fucked  C7 level

with AD from that Are you or have you had sex since your injury What kind of experience was it for you Positive or negative How do you deal with the frustration and pent up energy of not being able to finish  I m just curious to hear other people stories I ve recently started something new so I m dealing with all this stuff at the momentAnyone else have trouble concentrating  deleted  I d blame baclofen   Are you on gabapentin and Lyrica What dose  Oxybutynin is proven to have this effect especially long term It s well know to any urologist specializing in neurogenic bladder   I would recommend looking at alternative bladder medications or treatments like Botox   Just google  Oxybutynin Cognition  if you want proof Ex https   www alzdiscovery org cognitive vitality article can overactive bladder medication harm your cognitive health I think it s probably the medication I ve been on oxy before and it is proven to mess your head up Now I don t take any medication and I feel fine I m a T5 complete so results may vary    For spasms I d suggest finding ways to work out Both your upper body and lower body I lift weights and use a little self moving bike thing and a walker to stand up with in order to work out my legs It s the nerve pain 100 mg of Gaba  pregab s  It s like a 4 pack of beer Feel ok not pissed but not straight I put up with my feet on fire to feel straight  I feel like baclofen does it to me That s the only one of those I take  Remember that while doctors prescribe your meds it is pharmacists who are the experts on them That is why you should always get all your meds dispensed by one pharmacy    preferably bon one pharmacist  She can then warn you of interactions  She s also the one to consult when you re getting untoward symptoms like this   I recall a time many years ago that I could not take a simple math ratio A B and kept calculating B A instead  It was due to an antihistamine I d been given  The brain is a very complex thing and some drug might be affecting it like you mention  Identify that drug and maybe you can get an alternative drug for the same purpose it was prescribed   However remember that the brain can develop work arounds for functional debilities  A stroke victim can develop new brain pathways to replace those lost by stroke  Hence practice practice practice  Learning new things is always work you may just have to work harder than you used to  I ve been trying the cbd but my state doesn t allow thc so it doesn t work I hadn t had any nerve pain until I had a syrinx fixed and now it s pretty bad and it effects my entire left side and chest so sadly I need the meds and my neurologist said these were the only two meds on the market for it I might try backing off them but the pain might make it just as hard to concentrate Gabapentin 100mg 3 times a day and lyrica 50mg at night The baclofen used to make me sleepy but I ve kinda gotten used to it now Botox was amazing I m on trospium as a secondary Issue about incontinenceYou should go to a urologist who specializes is neuro related issues They will have ideas There are definitely things that you can do from botox to medicines to surgery but everyone is different so go to a doctor who can do a urodynamics study   Also my bladder is crazy and did not respond well to treatment but that didn t stop me from finding a partner so I just wanted you to know that a little leak or some adult diapers won t ruin everything If someone can t handle that they might not be the best person to be in a relationship with I understand the anxiety though and I hope you can get your bladder management worked out so you are more comfortable and confident Maybe follow WAGSofSCI on instagram to see lots of pictures of happy women dating and married to men with SCI  I was having lots of incontinence issues and I went to see my urologist and got a urodynamics test Turns out my bladder was constantly trying to squeeze I got on some new meds and I haven t had any issues since  Ditropan XL gave me my bladder back  15 mg once per day  I second seeing a urologist  I had leakage after 3 months of a constant foley bag wore away the either so I got a bladder sling I m sure they could do the same or something along those lines for a male  It completely stoped all my leakage problems  C1 quad here and I got Botox injections as well and it definitely helps you should look into it you can catheterize less and holds a lot more usually I can hold that for about 6 hours I hold about 800 ml As an aside you can buy pads that are for incontinence I use them because I tend to leak a lot in between cathing They are not as hard to get on as diapers you just slide them in the front of your underwear It helps with odor a lot too  Something like this  you can usually find them in drug stores too   https   smile amazon com Prevail Maximum Absorbency Incontinence 14 Count dp B000NNCQ38 ref sr_1_6 keywords male pads qid 1570837007 sr 8 6  Have you tried mirabegron  Myrbetriq  available in the U S  It s not anticholinergic like oxybutynin and trospium so you don t get the dry mouth side effects It relaxes the bladder by targeting beta receptors  Thanks for your reply man Yes I did see the Urologist they suggested for an operation to fix the valve but there only had 1 case before and the result wasn t appaling The patient had to re do the

hole on your stomach for catheterization   Thanks btw mateI didn t have an issue with the bladder capacity i think Coz earlier this month i did urodynamics test and my bladder was huge and can holds almost 1liter But it leaks even with 150ml inside while putting pressure coughing  Thats when the doctor finds out it the valve problem   Thanks mate enjoy your dayI did try using this kind of protection pad For an hour or so the leakage is minimum as correlate with my fluid intake But after a glass water with a pressure it can t hold much Bam It goes my pants and mostly done for the day

bicep and relocate it to your tricep Maybe someone here has more info on this I remember one person that I met that had it and they could at least use their  tricep  against gravity Sorry you are struggling  as someone mentioned below in comments there is surgery that can give you the function of triceps It s called tendon transfer surgery and can be highly effective  however has long recovery process I m c5 c6 complete since 2003 and had the surgery on both arms as well as on my thumbs to get some pinch function Its big decision but has been life changing for me Good luck I never liked this logic Just because life might suck more for someone else that doesn t mean that this guy isn t struggling Don t gatekeep his frustration with the cards he was delt Shit sucks This guy gets it What type of home do you all live in House Apartment Condo I live with my parents right now and the house didn t need modifications luckily But I am looking at moving back to the city I was in before the accident and no place I ve found would work without some form of modification It usually only requires widening doorways to accommodate my chair or a small ramp  I lived in a bunch of apartments Now I m in a ranch style  one story  on a slab foundation I bought a fixer upper gutted the interior and poured new porches and sidewalks that slope up to them I looked at houses for 6 months in a neighborhood that had the style of home that would work for me at a good price point Lots of homes being flipped so it took a bit to find one that hadn t already been renovated My boyfriend at the time dragged me up and down a lot of porch steps to look at them all Now we are married in a beautiful accessible house  I bought a house last year but I ve lived in 4 apartments since my injury  Lived with my parents right after injury they modified my room and bathroom with a roll in shower Now I live in a regular apartment with the wife   I use a shower chair for over the toilet and a padded shower bench in the shower tub I had a ramp built and my bathroom modified to a roll in shower I m currently in the process of turning my walk out basement into a handicap accessible living area my wife and I will live in the new area while a friend will live upstairs and be a grounds keeper  Looking for adviceI m sure she would appreciate your help Just make sure to communicate openly and it s okay to ask and learn what she does and doesn t need help with Don t take it personally when she doesn t want help and just be there for when she does  If she has been a quad for over twenty years she has already had someone doing these things for her or has been doing them for herself  What is it that makes you think you will be doing them  Did you have a conversation where you two decided that these aspects of care would be transferred to you  I thank you so much for your response it was very helpful Well I figure at some point we will want to be alone  It would be very awkward to have her caregiver around when we want to make out Thank you for your response After reading your response about intimacy  I realized that I forgot to mention that we are both in our 40 s and I do have issues with my back so I guess that s where the concerns of being able to lift or move her came from baclofen side affectsThis is true It s a muscle relaxant and antispasmodic Since ejaculation involves the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscles Baclofen can affect ejaculation by relaxing these muscles However it might not affect you this way and the benefits might outweigh the risks    I can link to some evidence based studies if you re interested  or have insomnia  haha   Not in my experience    It makes me forget certain words at times but that s all  Sure could you share the linkI had a microdiscetomy on my L5 S1 two months ago and the past week i have been getting chills close to 10 times a day sweating more than usual and feeling weird with my breathing and heart Should i be worried You may have an infection I d take your temp and see your doc The procedure is too low on your spine for autonomic dysfunction Hope it gets better soon  The surgery went well with the nerve pain but I also have chrons disease and perianal disease could that have something to do with possibly having a infection  Sounds like an infection Have you checked your temps The absolute last thing you want to do is sit on an infection and get sepsis  Definitely get checked Better to be safe than sorry Does anyone sleep on a purple mattress or tried one Looking between that and the sleep

immersed in this cloud of gas  https   bedroomsandmore com blog mattress buyers guide to off gassing    My fianc  is a C5 and we have a Reverie bed It s really two beds and each can be adjusted independently The heads and feet raise up and there are  massage  settings as well We absolutely LOVE our bed  I have a Nectar Cheap and its great My neck pain completely vanished and my back pain went down considerably Main reason I got one is they have a 365 day trial period in which you can return it  they send someone to pick it up  no questions asked All other matresses have 100 days or less  That s what I really like about the sleep number is the pressure relief and all the adjustments you can do Which sleep number do you have How big of a worry is this This is the first time I ever heard about this so Im assuming the effect is negligible Anyone who stopped taking medication for nerve pain how do you manage  deleted   deleted  I slowly weaned off of all of my medication and I am a C1 complete So I don t take any medication that deals with nerve medicine I don t even take Tylenol for that matter To be honest what helped me the most was going to a chiropractor which is completely against medical advice but it helped me a whole lot Also I bought a TENS machine that actually helps my right shoulder out whenever I do feel any sort of pain Fairly inexpensive on Amazon I was on quite a bit of Pregabalin when I had my injury but slowly built it off I m used to the consistent tingling  it used to be painful  and from time to time I have a period where I have extra pain A sharp pain at like 30 sec intervals Paracetamol helps dull that but it does affect my mood and sleep Now I don t use any medication and it really helped improve my energy and mood so I m happy I did it I d say try to slowly decrease your dose and then try to go without for a period Pain management immensely differs per individual You might be able to go to a pain policlinic to see what you can do to decrease your dependence on medication  I was lucky to only have pain for the first 6 8 months  I never took medication and decided to suck it up  It was a constant 5 6 10 and never went away  It came to a point where I had forgotten what no pain felt like and it became the norm  Then seemingly within a matter of 4 6 weeks it all went away     x200B   Hard to know how bad your pain is but you could try weening yourself off meds and potentially off entirely on the premise that you are ok tolerating some level of constant pain  I was on gabapentin for like 3 years  2 years before my injury but that s another story  300mg 3x day then pregabalin for another 2 years 150 mg 3x day it sucked going off it I went off super slowly I think I gradually lowered my dose for a couple of months I had a lot of pain at first because of stopping the meds but it s been getting better now it s always present and sometimes bad enough to be distracting but the side effects of the meds were worse and lyrica is super freaking expensive  I had high frequency spinal cord stimulators installed which fixed  quieted  my nerve pain   I couldn t do the gaba and lyrica anymore   Was taking tons and never worked that well to begin with  Check out the Nevro HF10 unit implant  I m currently taking Gabapentin 600mg 3x daily Started at 400 but went up when I felt like it wasn t doing much for me Now I feel the same way about the 600 lol  So I totally understand what you mean by missing a dose or two of Gabapentin and not noticing My injury happened 3 years ago btw I started looking into other shit that would help besides medicine too  my goal is to come off everything eventually   I mean I don t know every single thing that you ve tried but what about applying something with heat like a heating pad This is something that helps me tremendously I use cbd oil and cbd cream occasionally too which does help ofc I ve also tried soaking in warm water with epsom salt which is pretty nice   I know this isn t much but using a heating pad is seriously the top choice for me atm Just anything with heat lol  It just does the most  Ugh I seriously wish I could help more But I hope you find the relief you re looking for If you ever want to talk or anything I m here anytime  Sorry to hear about what youre going through    I have an incomplete C7 injury and get terrible nerve pain also I found taking 2000 mg of agmatine does help a small amount which is a natural supplement Also for some reason when I stop eating gluten or grains I experience less pain than normal Another thing that helps decrease the pain is CBD it s something I smoke before sleeping every night I just weaned off them   it hurts like hell some days but I m working towards trying to manage my pain with OTC medications right now to try and get off opiods so I ve had to come to the conclsuion that yeah its going to really hurt sometimes After a while you do become acclimatised to the nerve pain and it just is and you don t really notice it but there can still be difficult days  What do you mean by  vape flower  Hahaha I appreciate your honesty Thank you I was an incredibly wary person with regards to medication before I had my surgery Aftwards I was put on gabapentin and baclofen then the gabapentin was swapped for duloxetine and now I m taking pregabalin with the duloxetine and baclofen I m taking extra vitamins and supplements to counter the effects of the medication It seems like since this happened to me I m on increasingly more medication as the years go by I just can t help but wonder what the rest of my life will be like as a result of this medication What side effects did you get from the GabaI ve been on pregabalin   lyrica for years only 75 mg twice a day but when I tried to wean off I struggled with insomnia   increased nerve pain so I m back on it till I find another alternative Everything you said is actually extremely helpful Your situation is very close to mine as far as timeline and medication I just can t deal with the side effects anymore I have zero attention span constantly exhausted and I m frequently struggling with my weight I ve started taking supplements for memory because I forget things at the drop of a hat     My doctor has mentioned it s possible for my body to learn to  turn down the volume  on my pain level over time I supposed I m just worried about the in between But knowing there are options out there like the Epsom soak and heating pad gives me more confidence in taking the leap Questions on cathsI self cath and get Botox injections A Foley cath won t do no harm every once in a while  There s also the all in one bag catheter system like coloplast compact Leg bags are a lot easier on flights for folks who can t do a 180 degree transfer from aisle chair to toilet or can t transfer independently to the aisle chair  My husband uses a 16  French coude tip looking for a brand that has a bag attached tho  I self cath with the vapro plus pockets if you want a leg bag for a condom cath set up you can use the Hollister 9805 leg bag kit and whatever condition cath size fits best  I use them all At home I reuse straight cath s cause I haven t had an issue with that for the year since my accident Hollister 14Fs At work I use speedicath compacts cause they are small ish and discreet enough I can store a couple emergency caths in my cushion Also I don t have to worry about being so clean as you don t touch them so there is little chance of infection and the infections I got when I got out of hospital were all from not being able to be as clean as I needed at a pub Out partying I use anything the speedis are great but they are short and I often cant get that close they have a longer one that comes in a sheath so you don t have to touch it I love that one but it is expensive I have no qualms about reusing that one for a couple hours at a bar it is fantastic as the ends connect to each other to keep it clean ish OR if it is going to be a real party of a night and I m not sure how things are going to work washroom wise or I expect to get pretty drunk I will foley and leg bag For flights I always leg bag When leaving I put it in a home before I leave when returning I put it in at the airport I keep all the supplies to do it as sterile as possible and I haven t had an issue yet  My husband T12 incomplete uses Coloplast French tip caths  pre lubed  We carry sooo many in a massive bag when flying However since getting bladder botox it has greatly increased his ability to hold it in especially for long flights  Same here I ve used an all in one catheter bag system too in a pinch and it s fine too Usually I just get the aisle chair   OP you can also get extension tubing that connects to an in out cath that lets you reach a toilet from the aisle chair or wheelchair or drain into a bottle Are getting the Botox injections worth it The Bard Touchless Plus is great If I had to cath in flight I d drape a blanket over myself do it then drop the blanket  No I don t care what people think  if I have to empty my bladder it will be done before it s hell and high water   It d preserve my shoulders by avoiding awkward transfers and I d not have to run the risk of a botched transfer and a skin breakdown How do you deal with grief and missing the things you love self worth etc I have been married for 21 years and I have to tell you that positions during sex aren t that important It s the closeness that my husband and I share during sex that I love   I do go through periods of grief but I think that is normal because people with SCI have lost a lot Grief isn t something that ends You think you are past it and it blindsides you  You should see an occupational therapist that specializes in sexuality There is more out there  I know exactly how you feel I m a C6 injured at 16 18 years ago Hell I m even tall like you Feelings like this have always bothered me and it s been worse lately I think it s because most of my friends are getting married and having kids now I don t really have any advice but just know you aren t alone  My boyfriend is c6 and we met after his injury He also is the same height as me well if he could stand lol Those things don t matter What matters is his attitude His personality drew me in He s got a passion for life most people don t have he plays rugby or murder ball he is a great father he is outgoing and kind and he treats me so wonderfully Also sex life is the best I ve ever had He makes sure I feel good and he asks questions about what feels good He usually does oral before I ride him We also have toys he likes to use on me  My husband is T12 incomplete and I met him post injury I wouldn t say that the first thing that came to my mind was how to go about the sexual stuff you mention but rather whether our personalities were compatible or not Also he has a really strong personality and it is his drive and ambition to improve post accident is what made me interested in him He was also athletic prior to his accident and still is  his injury is from surfing   Stay in the  now   Work on being in the  now   It is a place  Stop overthinking the past or the future Thank you for that You are a woman I assume   I m glad to know that I m not alone in still experiencing triggers of grief What do you find helps Do you actively avoid things you know will trigger grief Wow crazy Have you dated since your accident  I dated a girl briefly in college but ended it because I knew I wasn t ready yet   My feelings on all this have also gone up lately too The girl I mentioned in the original post has started slowly coming back in my life It just brings up all this stuff It s amplified by the fact she is extraordinarily promiscuous  but has no interest in me anymore since post accident  It stings I am trying to be mature and be friends It s difficult Thank you for your response I d like to ask some personal questions if you don t mind I m always worried about the work involved with sex and maintaining a decent energy level with frequent regular sex Not just the sex itself but the before and after How frequent do you guys prefer it How does cleanup work for him Does he get into the shower post sex Does his energy go down from all the work involved Looking for advice Hi   I m a C4 C5 TBI m Injured as a teenager 9 years ago I hadn t yet had the opportunity to work Regardless I still went to college and graduated with a degree in psychology  not a psychologist  Whenever I drive by the location in which my accident occurred it triggers anger and takes me back to my injury subconsciously   As you pointed out you suffer from PTSD when you go back to work Whether it is the same setting in which your accident occurred or not due to the fact that it is the same job it can trigger PTSD Although I cannot relate so your situation I think you re on the right track and going back to school to pursue a different career or even pursuing a different job within a different setting will help you  PTSD and even triggered grief is very common post injury It can be difficult to not let it get in your head I would honestly seek out a therapist that you feel comfortable with who can help you process some of this stuff I m also C6  20 years post and wish I would have then at least every 6 months or so The mental parts are often the biggest source of struggle for me   As far as career I can also recommend returning to school to find something else The change in environment will help and it will also let you move into a job you enjoy  Hey   I m assuming you re in Canada you should give Neil Squire Society a call They can help with retraining and identifying accommodations It sounds like that s not really the same job anymore and with the PTSD might not be the ideal spot for you   SCI BC offers scholarships for people in Canada with SCI   send me a dm and I ll give you the info  Thanks   When you were in school what did you do for notes in class I don t have any hand function and currently my writing would never keep up Need adviceThis treatment works very well for me Your bladder will hold less and you will have more urges to go right after the procedure Over time this will relax It has helped a ton with leakage and accidents I now can comfortably know I won t have an issue even if I cannot cath for a bit  Botox is one of the best things you can get I am going for my second treatment in a month or so There is blood for the first day or two but after that it is a dream I experienced a big increase in bladder capacity and much less leaking in between bathroom visits Dealing with urology is scary and frustrating in my experience After none of the pills did anything for me I had the botox injection It didn t work for me There weren t any noticeable side effects but there wasn t any real improvement I then went through a bladder augmentation surgery in January 2018 The positive effects took a while to stabilize but now my bladder holds at least 500ml before signaling through autonomic dysreflexia that it needs to empty and it does a good job holding until I m able to get to a bathroom Your situation will get better You are doing the right thing by going through the process with urology  I ve gotten Botox about 15 times and it really is amazing As others have said the first few days to a week after it s basically like you have a uti for me I ve never had any side effects other than not pissing myself although I don t get it done anymore because my bladder decided to not accept more than 300ml no matter how much Botox I get  Will I still have to wear a condom cath and leg bag     Thanks for the reply  I am hoping things will be betterdo ya still have the do somethin with your penis what is the most you should hold in your bladder without problems thank ya very much  I am new to talking to people like me  I am grateful for any info or even just conversation after the botox goes in  I have high hopes this will make things betterwhat is autonomic dysreflexia wewewerwere ya able to lay free  without somethin on or around your penis   International travelThe person usually family or friends  that i m travelling with usually just blocks the vision from the left if i m in the middle windowseat so I can conduct my business in peace    I don t have to cath but once a few years ago went on a long road trip and used a condom catheter so i could go when needed it was discreet and got the job done  Go for it But ask your doc just to be on the safe side since it does have a slightly higher risk of infection As has already been suggested you could consider a condom cath but consider wearing a diaper with both It will just help avoid any accident on the way   Other than that have a safe trip     I use Foleys for long distance flights  They re easy to insert and drain and well worth it for peace of mind  I m good for about 6 hours  usually  but it s easy to be stuck on the tarmac for a few hours if there are plane troubles so I use them for anything over 3 hours or so   deleted  The long haul flights have onboard aisle chairs on board Be sure to verify that they have it and specify that you ll need it if that is your plan I like transferring and using the cabin bathroom to cath 2   3 times during the flight because it also gives me an opportunity to change position Once I did have the flight attendants disappear and not respond to the call button for 20 minutes on a long haul from Japan to midwest but that is not common  I had to ask a fellow passenger to fetch the flight attendant from wherever Also the big planes take 1 hr to board and deplane so add 1 hour to each end of your flight when planning any kind of bathroom   bag emptying scheme etc since most flights will make wheelchair users get on first and off last Plus you never know about delays once boarded too  Aren t those only for men We don t know OP s sexDoes your doctor allow you to place and remove a foley on your own When I inquired about a Foley for long distance flights my doc said I d have to come in and have the Foley placed by him and then he wanted me to leave it in my entire trip or arrange to have it removed by medical staff at my destination My wife   I are both paraplegics we made the 12 hour flight from east coast to Hawaii  Cathing was very simple for my wife we just ask stewardess for a blanket   cath under that I myself just used a 36 OZ leg bag with condom drainage   limited drinking Also could of partially emptied leg bag into a

to someone with new spinal cord injury I m so sorry to hear how hard this has been on both of you   Unfortunately the truth is that it takes a REALLY long time to adjust to having a spinal cord injury I had mine two years ago and am only just getting back to feeling like myself I ve spoken to loads of people who have said the first five or ten years are incredibly hard and then it gets easier It s just a really really long process to start getting used to the massive changes   That doesn t make it fair or easy on you though and I m sure that s got to be frustrating I don t know where you re located but it would be worth looking into what services are available to you If you re in the UK there are many different charities that can help with things like counselling occupational therapy to make adjustments to the house etc If you re in the US or elsewhere I m sure there are similar organisations but I wouldn t know what they are   hopefully someone will be able to give some suggestions  I m also a spouse of a recent SCI My husband was injured in January 2018 c5 7 incomplete We currently have an 18 month old   Unfortunately the other comments are correct It s just about impossible to  force  someone to get help get involved or get their act together   I have not had the same struggle you have My husband has gotten a bit frustrated with the situation and tends to see the things he can t do anymore but I have an incredible support system around me to help with my toddler financial issues and more   Some big things that helped me were 1  Meeting with other SCI couples and learning what they do to make things work 2  Talking with a therapist on my own to learn how to better communicate and handle stress  my husband scoffs at the idea of him needing to talk to a therapist  3  I let my husband know that I can t invest more energy in his health than he does This means that he s responsible for tracking bowel movements taking care of his feet remembering to take any medication keeping track of supplies we need etc 4  I prioritize taking care of myself when possible This means that I take  time off  from my husband paint my nails go to lunch where I want to eat etc   Some of those things may require time money or energy that you don t have   This is when support systems hopefully come in If anyone says  Let me know if there s anything I can do to help  ask them to drive your husband to physical therapy watch your kids for an hour so you can go to the grocery store by yourself ask if they can walk your dog mow your lawn clear snow off your driveway or take the trashcans out in If your husband is able see if someone would invite him to play videogames it board games If there s a convention in town that might interest you husband ask someone to take him   If you want someone to talk to feel free to send me a message It s hard when 99  of the people around you don t understand the new obstacles that are in your way  I got my injury about 7 years ago And only within the last 3 4 year did I start being better   Year 1  it is brutal You just fall into a pit of depression I was in school so that distracted me but I was so depressed that I don t even remember that year Like most of that year is blank in my memory   Year 2  I distinctly remember the first time I was happy that year this year really got better because of the people I was surrounded with It is really hard for you because you are always there but I would suggest surrounding your partner with other people People who are patient and understanding It will ease your burden a lot  Coincidentally I have a T4 injury from Transverse Myelitis February 13 1999 I m on break at work right now but if you think I can help at all shoot me a message I ll respond when I can  It took me a while to learn and recognize that I m not the only one affected by my injury  c6 complete in 1998 from driving   Socializing with other similar injury level guys is what helped me adjust I found wheelchair sports and that is where I met friends who helped me the most Traveling   driving and flying   to tournaments staying in hotels going out to restaurants etc where I want the only wheelchair

you for sharing your story and that Facebook page Yes After being diagnosed he was in hospital for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks of intensive physical therapy After coming home he went about once a week After a month of that they stopped and wanted him to come back once he regained movement in his legs   He in back in hospital now  it has been a week  because he got a really bad pressure sore which caused him to get an infection in his blood Doctors are now saying they want him to go back to an inpatient physical therapy facility I ve been recording my physical therapy lately  L1 incomplete Bedrest for pressure ulcer healing   help me with your positioning suggestionsNot sure what kind of work you do But you might want to consider speech to text software It might enable you to stay on your side or stomach and not have to type Most operating systems come with this software already installed  you just have to enable it If you want really really good text to speech software consider purchasing Dragon  I ve known folks who ve gotten pretty skilled with it  some even complete spreadsheets and do computer programming with it  As far as ring cushions mentioned elsewhere I would say no They can cause a lot of internal shear and you have to consider the material it is made of They are essentially moving the pressure elsewhere I had a buddy who was hospitalized for a year with a ring pillow wound I would focus instead on not sitting lying on the wound and varying your position throughout the day and night  Good luck  I know it must suck Have you tried a ring cushion I used it when I had a sore So technically the butt is inside the ring and no weight on it  You can use it on a wheelchair or regular chair or even bed  That ways no pressure on the butt   Also take frequent breaks Wishing you a speedy recovery Take care  Quad here I get one of those wedge pillows lay on my stomach with laptop in front of me for decent periods of time    https   www walmart com ip

Ride cushion which is a custom Ring cushion of sorts so I don t want to mess around Thanks I appreciate it I don t think a ring cushion is a good move for me the wound is in the area you bear weight

not getting the treatment and information you need to get an accurate picture of what your life is going to be like  Surfers myelopathy as well here four years post I am complete with no change in my

you are C T Idk if there is a place near you that does something like this  https   images app goo gl Q2v4x3kBnYmYL5V57  They hook you up to a harness and place you on a treadmill    If you cant move your legs they move them for you and ask you to imagine youre moving them yourself Theres this dude I used to follow on IG that did that for 6 months after he was injured before he was able to move any part of his legs Believe he was Asia A at first as well He can walk again now unassisted but not like he used to    Make sure your blood pressure can handle it though and you dont pass out  My injured level is T9 T12 spinal cord infarction Thank you for your information and kindness i have to search whether there is any provider of spinal implant in Hong Kong But i am wondering if it is a expensive treatment Anyone found anything to help with phantom nerve pain L1   L3 incomplete Has he tried cannabis products at all  Interesting I did wonder if because of the damage the brain can feel something but doesn t know how to interpret this so you feel the pain I guess it s a bit advanced for me  Can I ask what the difference between  phantom  nerve pain and  regular  nerve pain is  I was on Lyrica for 2 days and it was the first thing that worked in 15  years However it landed me out of commission for a week for a little over a week with uncontrollable bowel movements It was also  500 a month because the US insurance plans here are a scam Those 2 days nerve pain were glorious though  No this is something that has cropped up a few times We re in the UK so thc products would be a no he s very much into driving too and enjoying going out  having a clear head Not sure if the oils CBD oils would help with the phantom nerve pain This is my interpretation as it s not me experiencing it But basically from the knee down there is no sensation However at night times it feels like his feet are on fire  feels like they are blowing up with pressure then someone s hitting them with a hammer So technically there s no feeling but does feel like there s pain So in theory there should be no pain as the nerves are damaged but causes issues so we call it phantom The most I found on the web is people suffer it with lost limbs There s not so much about SCI that I could find Cathing queryYour best option is to go and get evaluated by a urologist and have a urodynamics test done   In a healthy bladder there are different pressures There s the pressure when you first feel like you should go there s when you feel like you really really need to go there s when you have no choice because it s coming  voiding  and there s when the urine can start backing up into the kidneys and causing damage   In someone with an SCI a urodynamics test can determine at what pressure your bladder functions If your body voids before urine backs into the kidneys then your kidneys are going to be fine but you might have to change clothes if you don t cath regularly If you don t feel anything and you don t void before urine starts backing up into the kidneys a urologist can tell you how much volume your bladder can hold   The urologist can also do things like prescribe a flow max medication work with you to manage your bladder discuss bladder Botox and find more options that can potentially increase your quality of life  I cath every four hours It takes some planning but it s what my urologist and I agreed on after a urodynamics test See the other comment about what that entails It may not seem like the most convenient situation but it s better than ending up in the hospital or ICU  Out of curiosity what kind of situation are you in where you can t cath every 4 hours  Do you need assistance  Work related  Lifestyle  Lack of accessible facilities   I ve been paralyzed for 20 years  The doctors have never specifically said that I need to cath every 4 hours but it was the general suggestion back when I was first paralyzed  I honestly don t recall when the last time I saw a urologist was  15 years ago maybe  But yeah as a general rule I cath every 4 to 5 hours  Sometimes much sooner depending on my caffeine intake  I m on 30mg of oxybutynin  generic Ditropan XL   On it I typically start getting the sensation the I need to urinate around every 4 or 5 hours so I go  Sometimes I go longer 6 or 7 hours  I don t cath during the night but I also only get about 5 hours of sleep a night  And like I said earlier if I have a lot of caffeine like consuming an energy drink in the morning it fucks it up where I m having to cath every 2 or 3 hours   But back to what I was asking before what prevents you from cathing every 4 hours  I lead a pretty normal life I work for 8 5 hours a day and then outside of work my day varies  I either just chill at home or I run errands or go out and socialize  It s never really a problem though to be able to cath every 4 hours if I need to  Why do you  have  to cath every four hours  100  what the other guy said  see a urologist BUT to answer your question more specifically I m supposed to cath every six hours Sometimes especially if I haven t been hydrating very well I forget and accidentally go longer Like 8 9 hours sometimes It s not certainly not good but that s real life And my kidneys are absolutely fine according to my annual ultrasounds  I wrote this detailed response and lost it Please pardon the brevity that comes with frustration   Going to concerts outdoor events and peoples  older apartments have been the main source of issue   I have no feeling or awareness when I may have to go Though it does seem like every 4 hours is appropriate conditional on beverages consumption Aside from a handful of protein shakes and maybe 4 cups of coffee a week I only drink water   Since posting this I have tried to exercise some advice received The  4 hour rule I ve taken a bit too literally Cathing should be more commensurate with consumption   Given the immaturity of my injury and ways of managing the changes of it  it s invaluable to get insight like this Thank you  Yep just did bladder Botox this morning I m hoping that I can ditch Ditropan because it dries me out constipates me and doesn t always work that well OP definitely see a urologist Wow  Thank you so much for the detailed response That was very informative and I shall take your advice and pursue that test   A quad friend of mine had mentioned the Botox option I ll be curious to see what I learn through my testing and guidance from the urologist I don t know that I  have  to My physiatrist advised on it during inpatient They told me I d find a groove I ve had several accidents so I try to stick to it as best I can Those of you who had traumatic SCI experiences did you have mental emotional support afterward While my SCI is technically classified as non traumatic  it still is somewhat trauma inducing to go from fully functional adult to I can t feel anything and am in a wheelchair all the time While I don t have to process the grief associated with an accident There is still a lot to unpack from my dancing one day to falling down walking the next to an incomplete paraplegic the following day   During my hospital stay they did offer some therapy  to which I declined due to a state of denial Though when I got to rehab they require you to see somebody as part of your stay I declined this also as I am lucky enough that this was my second stint in inpatient rehab So I knew the therapist and I didn t get along and from after my ski accident But I did work with a therapist the previous time in outpatient rehab that I was able to mesh with well and process a lot So I had orders to meet with her again  We were able to process a lot of the small things that were happening over the first couple months I went back to school this month and now having been seeing a counselor  who I ve also seen before  on campus who I ve been able to continue the work with   I think this has given me the permission and space to feel what I need to feel so far  I am only 4 months out  I don t think I would have some of the emotional ability to handle some of the situations I ve faced without it It is easy to suppress some of the trauma associated with SCI to appease the comforts of those around you Therapy gives you the opportunity to confront it and manage it    Though all of this being said I know this come from a place of privilege where I am afforded the ability as part of my rehab and college tuition to see a counselor So if you are financially able I highly recommend it  I ve been able to unpack things from when I had brain surgery when I was like 6 to my ski accident to being a paraplegic It allows me to live fully in this body as I allow it to slowly recover  Mine happened 4 years ago next month I ve been in trauma focused therapy twice a week since It helps me just get through the day to day I definitely recommend it I wouldn t know what to do otherwise  Mine happened 3 years ago next month  I was already seeing a therapist still am I would say it helped bc I hit some really dark places for a long time I finally had my hopefully last surgery beginning of this month and I m ready to process what I can and move on It was debilitating to go from functioning normal to chronic severe pain losing function in my arm and eventually my legs After my last surgery the pain was reduced a lot and I feel like I am coming out of a 3 year fog  Yes Go to therapy See if it helps  Mine happened 4 years ago I have a very supportive family and one good friend I do not have a medical insurance and therapies are expensive and I do not trust most of the therapists The rehab where I go one the therapists is a friend and happens to be a therapist so that counts maybe But that was only twice and more than a year ago I get bouts of negativity feelings of helplessness which I deal by angrily punching the shit out my legs Which is not correct but I don t know how to deal with either I compensate that by working and reading a lot I have no idea how to do anything else   Coming to the point after a long rant  emotional support is really important Not only for the injured but also for family members who are supporting them  I saw the therapist twice the second time he said I am wasting his time I don t need therapy the only thing I am having a hard time dealing with is doing a desk job it is totally and utterly way outside of my interest in all other respects I am just as happy if not happier than before my accident Last year I became a T10 complete and have been rehabilitating through the Abilitylab here in Chicago since   My experiences with that facility as it relates to mental health was phenomenal During inpatient I had a therapist and psychiatrist who worked primarily with SCIs Outside the injury I have had both a therapist and psychiatrist   After discharge I entered a day rehab program It was at that time my mental health took a huge dive Thankfully my therapist recognized it and at day rehab I started seeing a psychologist who specializes in SCI patients   Perhaps there are support groups around the city as well I can t speak to that though   I can t imagine how I would be able to cope without their support Sure having someone mediate your different ways of grieving may have worked out differently Hopefully you have been able to cope with the injury and the disconnection Keep being strong   I m currently going through the same situation at the age you were I m so cynical and skeptical about talking I feel like even if it does do something for me it s gone as soon as I m back to myself But I suppose it can t hurt to try   if money is tight  I broke up w my SO other and I know none of this would be the mess it is if I was the person I was before the injury Mentally I m so checked out it s ridiculous   All we can do is learn from it Sometimes bc the deed is done When I m off good meds I m sort of of content for a brief moment and often think in terms of well it is what it is and it ain t what it ain t But that s short lived and I m back to a dark place   I m hoping that by putting myself in these rehab circles I can find me a cute PT or OT that is better equipped when it comes to our situation I ve heard a lot of stories like that  Happy Cake Day Yea don t do the leg punching thing I ending up getting Myositis ossificans after doing just that Now I got a huge layer of bone where my thigh muscle should beIs anyone here a non traumatic spinal cord injury patient Does anyone have a very low injury level  lumbar and lower  Trying to connect with people like myself I believe there is a few on the discord    https   discord gg PBk9NJE Hey friend   I have an injury that has left me capable of walking I walk with a cane and am most independent I m always looking for someone with the same degree of problem as me DM if you wanna connect  Non traumatic yes  spinal cord tumor  low injury level no  C5 ish hard to pinpoint exactly as tumors don t create nice circumscribed lesions    In everyday life the injury is fairly nonobvious at least to everyone else Affected side is mostly about 2 3 the strength of the un  less affected side except for the hand which gets strength grade 3 depending on how the neurologist feels on that particular day  mine was non traumatic but not low level  i m lower cervical  i m totally non ambulatory though I could probably stand with 1 or 2 people helping me I haven t tried since I was discharged from PT over a year ago but still hi are you in the sci discord there are some non traumatic injuries there too  That describes me pretty well I had Degenerative disc disease and a horrible case of stenosis which combined with time and not qualifying for health insurance back in  06 and the years leading up created the perfect storm when I twisted wrong in the shower  and here I am Anyway that was my L4 L5 incomplete injury after a few surgeries  As I m guessing you ve surmised from the comments below you re not at all the only one Mine was also non traumatic  at least not physically traumatic  psychologically is a different story    I was born with spina bifida which really didn t affect me very badly It was a series of medical errors and too many surgeries that ended up landing me in a chair and I ve been using it for maybe 3 1 2 years now I m bad at remembering time   Definitely come join us on the Discord server  L4 and L5 From injury I am relatively new to this as well and kind of in the dark about Spinal cord injury and resources  I had surgery and currently in physical therapy Mostly independent and can walk but have some bowel issues mostly around constipation I feel like this is an important topic that I want to talk about more And have questions on  I have a t12 burst vertebrae fused that bruised my spinal cord now 12 years ago I am fully functional but have to take medications daily for the neuropathic pain in my calves feet I get minor muscle spasms and cramps but am otherwise in good shape given the injury and the meds which I regret having to take but here we are It was traumatic took probably 2 years to really get fully functional but now is just chronic  Mine was due to a virus so it was non traumatic but I m paralyzed from the chest down and can t walk at all  Myelopathic spondylitis here   C4 5 in a metal cage   might get a second op on C5 6  I can walk  but have massive abdominal rigidity This cause bad mad pain when i walk any distance   very frustrsating But could be much worse I fell 40 ft after my protection failed while rock climbing and received a burst L4 vertebrae I was very fortunate and other than some minor numbness in my shins I can walk  I m technically  non traumatic  shoot me a PM if you wanna talk about it  Non traumatic SCI here and very incomplete Cause was Transverse Myelitis  spinal cord inflammation likely autoimmune origin  when I was 13 Not low level though I have spots of damage from about C1 T1 and I have partial paralysis  and weakness  in my arms hands but close to full movement in my legs In my legs the issue is mainly weakness and foot drop so I can walk short distances My injury is L3 L5 from congenital conditions originally but now also from a failed spinal fusion  I have spina bifida at l4 l5  deleted  Can t walk but miine is from an illness Started t9 and 10 could still walk for the first three years since the illness made it too my spine  About 4 years ago it went up to T3 5 put me in a chair  Still have some leg movement just not much  Multiple Sclerosis that thus far has only attacked my spinal cord resulting in 2 lesions 1  very small  at c2 and the larger one at c5 6 though incomplete Literally woke up one day in 2015 and this has been life from then on  Mine is considered non traumatic feel free to message me  Theoretically non traumatic  due to selective dorsal rhizotomy  L1 S2 ish   Adhesive Arachnoiditis plus multiple sacral nerve cysts   I can walk a block or two on a good day with my rollator or crutches  At this point nerve pain weird sensations and sensory loss predominantly from the hips down in patches But also lost a good chunk of my sexual function Bladder and bowels wonky but hanging in there for now   Some muscle weakness that s manifesting mostly in my feet and hips  Hey there I ll shoot you a DM I use my wheels for anything more than 5 10 mins but I have a genetic condition that complicates things too Yeah I had a lumbosacral cyst that messed me up I had surgery 8 9 weeks ago and still have no reflexes in my knees and ankles No I m not in the discord but feel I may have to join with all these comments Hey there Now we re talking I think I m L4 to my tailbone S5 Large spinal cyst eroded bone now I have instability and worsened nerve pain since surgery 8 9 weeks ago But my bodily functions work better You win some you loose some I guess How did that goI feel like I can really relate to the spina bifida community I just got diagnosed with a sacral meningocele a year ago and had surgery 8 9 weeks ago L4 S5 for me My downward progression in the past year was pretty steady every three months I would decline Now after surgery my bodily functions are better but I m considering adaptations such as hand controls and full time wheelchair use with a smart drive in petitioning insurance for It s been a roller coaster of a year Thankfully I found adaptive sports but it s still confusing because a group of traumatic paras taught me that I had a non traumatic spinal cord injury No doctor ever worded it to me that way   I ll have to reinstall discord for sure   I had a lot of constipation before surgery but didn t do a bowel program or anything 9 weeks post op It s amazing how different each injury isI have moderate numbness in my sciatic nerves in my thighs Also L4 to S5 Mine is from a cyst I can walk too but am finding it tiresome lately How do you adapt to your hardest challenges L4 S5 here I am thankful to have not had any hardware put in Sacral meningocele L4 S5 Had surgery about 8 9 weeks ago Not much improvement in the mobility department So you just have paralyzation of your legs but your bowel and bladder function is preserved How interesting if that s the case Sorry to hear of your illness struggles T3 sounds toughDid they show up easy on supine mris I wrote a musical play about disabilities which had its first public reading one month ago Here is the video of that reading It is mostly based on my experiences but I did have some input from friends of mine who have various different disabilities   Keep in mind that although it is a mostly finished product there are some minor changes still being made here and there Also we only had one rehearsal before the reading so some parts might be rough   I m open to suggestions if anyone has some to offer   I m the one sitting in the wheelchair with the guitar just fyi   Thank you for your time and have a great day  Need some help writing a character with paraplegiaI think most people if they re conscious feel shock and fear that they re going to die and a realization that they can t move feel   idk how much time goes by in the story after the character s injury but I thought i d include this too  psychologically it s just shitty at first there s a lot of fear and maybe self blame or anger  depending on the cause of the injury  the initial hospitalization is confusing and lonely and overwhelming   I know you said you ve found some info about the social side but there s a lot of conflicting info if you re going for a realistic representation of paralysis it s not all inspiring and positive it s also not a lifetime of anger and depression it s a gradual shift from anger and sadness to acceptance and there s usually no miracle cures or anything  My injury didn t involve physical trauma so may not be a great representation of what you re looking for nor the usual emotions sensations but might give a different perspective on things and maybe isolate the immediate sensations of paralysis without distraction from pain major physical incident Apologies if it s too TMI in parts but figured that may be useful     x200B   This was 10 years ago I was sat outside with friends at university when my back started feeling really uncomfortable Not painful but a restless feeling similar to where your legs feel restless and you need to shake them around The restless feeling didn t go when I adjusted my back and started to feel more intense I got up to walk inside and find my room to lie down but as I was walking my legs started feeling heavy and hard to move a bit like wading through waist high water I also felt like I suddenly desperately needed the toilet I was near a bathroom so I managed to get inside quickly sat on the toilet and then immediately lost control of my bowels I remember feeling worried knowing something bizarre was happening When I tried to stand up to use the toilet paper I realised I couldn t I still had complete sensation around my legs  as in I could feel external touch  and  internal sensation   something I still have a kind of proprioception where I feel as though I know where my legs are and how to move them but they won t respond I often compare the feeling to my legs being compacted in sand   it s like I am physically able to move them but some outside force is holding them still  I was there for maybe 10 15 mins trying to move my legs and figure out what to do     x200B   I eventually threw myself onto the floor so that I could lay on my side to use the toilet paper and then started trying to pull my jeans up I remember not really thinking anything specific no particular thoughts running through my head but was in a kind of emergency mode drive Not a conscious panicking but I suppose a sort of panicky animal  I have to do A B C immediately  instinct I opened the door and dragged myself out and because the toilet was right by the stairs up to the ground floor  weird building layout that s hard to explain  I lay there and waited  didn t have a phone on me and as I was an insecure 18 year old who was unsure whether this was extremely serious or easily resolvable the last thing I wanted was to scream dramatically for help at the bottom of a flight of stairs  I think I must ve been waiting 20 minutes  very stupid  until some friends saw me While I was waiting I remember a fizzing popping numbing sensation starting to develop in my toes  similar to constant pins and needles which gradually spread up to my waist over the next day and something I still feel today   I think this sensation is quite common  If you want me to elaborate on this part where I was transported to hospital let me know     x200B   This next bit may be superfluous but I thought it could help expand on the mindset I had when the injury first happened Anyway once I was in hospital because this seemed such a bizarre event which wasn t caused by illness or physical injury I figured it was probably going to go as quickly as it had arrived So I acted with a lot of bravado the first month to impress my friends and myself I still had that panicky internal  just do A B C  mindset compartmentalising everything and taking things moment by moment but was also kind of morbidly excited that I could get past the first really challenging experience of my life relatively calmly and casually I realise now I only thought this because I figured it wasn t permanent However with each day the stress and worry got worse as I realised nothing was changing and I wasn t recovering any sensation or movement About a month and a half in I had my 19th birthday and completely broke down While I had mostly been quite stoic the prior month I still had an infantile view of birthdays where it is  your  day people are nice to you any issues can be put to the side I suppose I expected my injury to have been understood and resolved and I d be back talking about it with my friends by then When I was instead woken up at 6 am for a warfarin stomach injection by this irritable bitch of a nurse the realisation that I was probably never going to have a break from this paralysis and that I wasn t going back to the way my life was hit me very hard     x200B   Anyway not sure if this is really what you wanted but hopefully it s a little bit useful I spent 3 months in that hospital then moved to a spinal rehab centre for 6 months where my experience was probably a bit more typical of SCIs If you want me to expand on that at all just let me know and I d be happy to help  I am paralyzed from the waist down  L1 is now fused to T11   When the accident happened  crashed a dirt bike in the woods  I remember a lot of discomfort obviously but the first thing I did was try and touch my dick to see if I could feel it It was really weird kind of like touching your arm that has fallen asleep and gone numb  This is also what the rest of my body felt like below the waist but I was mostly upset about my dick   After that it started getting really difficult to breathe because of a collapsed lung When the emt s finally got to me I was just focused on dealing with the pain 10 seconds at a time  My body felt similar to how it would feel if I tried to sprint past the point of exhaustion and then keep sprinting    Hope this helps message me if you want any more details  I m a fairly new SCI and I still remember everything pretty well  I d start by telling you that people don t always get injured from the  waist down  You can be injured in a variety of different locations among the vertebrae people who get injured around the waist are L injuries people who get injured on their back are T injuries and people who get injured in the neck are C injuries With a number corresponding to each vertebrae Like T2 T5 C3 or L1 I didn t have a traumatic injury so I ll share a story from someone else   They fell  couldn t feel or move their lower extremity  They weren t scared it didn t hurt much  and they didn t realize how serious it was  Went to the hospital because his friends basically made him  Later on at the hospital his body freaked out  see autonomic dysreflexia  and he felt REAL bad and thought he was dying It took a few days for him to realize he d never walk or feel his legs again  Then of course it takes months or years to feel the full extent of how life had changed      As for me  I never had an  oh shit  moment I just woke up from surgery with my legs not working well  I did the therapy stuff and at first it didn t work  but then it did  I was really calm and practical about the whole thing  I felt like my legs worked enough that I could do most things I wanted to do in life  which was partly true and partly denial   I was already used to using a wheelchair and I felt like I could still get to the second story of my house by crawling  Lucky me I got enough function back that I can walk pretty well as long as I pace myself and am not too tired  If you really want a realistic look at SCI you should research stuff like autonomic dysreflexia and bowel bladder management I was 32 when I was injured and up until that point I never considered all the additional complications beyond just not being able to walk   My experience won t be all that helpful to you because I only briefly lost the ability to walk   3 months  but I will tell you I would  gleefully  go back to using a chair if I could have bowel bladder back And most of the people I met in rehab felt the same way  My husband cannot feel below his armpits Car accident in 1991 He was thrown through the back window   was conscious the whole time He recalls he thought he landed in a hole the sensation was so foreign   sudden  Skiing accident for me  Completely paralyzed from middle of my chest down I crashed into a wooden fence When I opened my eyes I couldn t feel anything below that point  I accepted it pretty much immediately and knew I would never walk again Even remember telling my girlfriend at the time I was never gonna walk again but everything was gonna be okay still as I was being loaded into the ambulance  And surprisingly I was actually okay with that Some other parts of SCI are pretty shit  shitting pissing pain etc  but the not walking never bothered me a whole lot  I shattered by t 6 vertebra  and a few of other broken bones  10 years ago when I was thrown from my car during a wreck I also had a severe concussion Between the concussion and the morphine I lost a week I do not remember having the oh shit I am paralyzed thought process as it must have happened during the week of no memories My first memories post accident are of being in rehab and having the mindset of what do I need to learn to safely make it through the world from a wheelchair      Edit to add   While not being able to walk is a major drag for me the worst parts are no sexual release bowel bladder management and the constant pain from the hardware in my back to stabilize my spinal column  spot on   I have never thought of myself as pitiable but I am certainly not an inspiration because I choose to interact with a society in spite of lack of access to many things  op   take a look at some writing about disability representations from Leslie Fiedler among many other disability studies writers  also look at the differences between the  medical model  versus the  social model  of disabilityI m not the story writer just a fellow non traumatic SCI patient Did you get cauda equina syndrome What was the cause of your paralyzation   They weren t scared it didn t hurt much and they didn t realize how serious it was   This might be relevant for the story If the character knows about spinal cord injuries not feeling part of their body after the trauma will scare them immensely and immediately while someone who is not familiar with what this probably means may not realize that their life won t be like it was before You d do well to know that to the experienced victim managing a paralysed bowel is quite often considered more of a unpleasant symptom than not walking Or having to make choices about how to empty the bladder Mysheperd brain and spine Christopher reeve foundation and spinal centres all publish stuff for new patients you d learn a lot by reading that deleted SuppositoriesAnyone who has suffered a spinal cord injury has had multiple bladder and bowel accidents You re not alone Suppositories should help when constipated if not you may need to do a manual clearing  As someone who has issues with keeping things moving along here s my advice   1  Make sure you eat enough food Food pushes things along I go every other day and by day 2 I m usually getting tight and assume I m not hungry so people have to remind me to eat   2  Watch what you eat  Obviously some things will clog you up like junk food others may cause diarrhea Try to maintain a normal healthy diet   3  Drink something hot and caffeinated like coffee Coffee makes everyone poo   4  Look into stool softeners and stay hydrated It took me a long time to figure this out but once I started drinking a healthy amount of water and taking stool softeners I started pulling out less rocks and had less clogs   5 Try getting flat and doing stretches or excercises We sit all the time getting straight and moving helps   6  As mentioned already massage the stomach while you digitally stimulate This is a technique a nurse taught me while in rehab and it works wonders   7  if you do bowlcare in your bed lay on your left side there s a reason I can t remember but it makes it easier for the poop to come out    8  The last thing is take your time This is the one thing that takes the most time and you can t rush It takes me like over an hour to do bowel care but I m always satisfied with the results   If you do all these things   the normal suppositories it might help My problem with suppositories is I fart them out before my body gives them a chance to work  I have Benefiber with my first 2 cups of water every day and usually take 2 Colace at night befre bed  I do bowel program every other day using Enemeez Seems to work well for me  When I was in the spinal unit following my accident one of the main things they focused on was establishing you into a regular bowel program and a long term cath solution either supapubic or intermittent   It can take awhile to train your bowel and accidents will happen but I have a program that works for me and I haven t had an accident in years   I m on a daily bowel routine I take 3x Senna tablets roughly 1hr before my evening meal and a Cosmacol powder about 1hr afterwards each night   I use 2x suppositories in the morning and drink 2x Cups of Coffee and that produces the desired result I always do my bowel routine at the same time everyday I was told during my rehab that this is important so your bowel learns when to open   I also drink plenty of water during the day and have a healthy varied diet   a bit of everything and plenty of fruit and fibre   Hope this helps  a LOT of the available suppositories seem to make people prone to blowouts or ongoing leakage after the initial BM I have trouble with suppositories but I ve heard good things about the Magic Bullet  c4 5 inc quad  4 magic bullet suppositories a day  about 3 hours to vacate completely no accidents ever  Gday everyone C5 6 quad nearly 25 years post injury here I ve found the main things for a good bowel program are drinking plenty of water   3 4 litres a day going to the toilet around the same time each day trying not to each too much red meat or white bread as I reckon it can block you up and having 3 meals a day you gotta have something there to push out   I have 2 3 coloxyl with senna after my night time meal washed down with water n benifbre  I try not to eat after 8pm so things got time to work  I get up around 6 30 7 and use a bisalax enema and massage my belly like others say I ve never had to digitally extract I don t drink coffee so have a cup of hot water on days it s slow  usually after beers   n another enema if need be Usually takes 40 mins or so Eating spicy food regularly helps a lot too  I feel as though I am not getting everything out I was on meds but they just made me poop 2 3 times a day  Parents help out   3  Drink something hot and caffeinated like coffee Coffee makes everyone poo   Hmm  I kinda remember when I searched for information few years ago it s said caffeinated drinks cause constipation instead is it not     6  As mentioned already massage the stomach while you digitally stimulate This is a technique a nurse taught me while in rehab and it works wonders   Mind elaborate a bit for me on how is it done Which part do you massage     7  if you do bowlcare in your bed lay on your left side there s a reason I can t remember but it makes it easier for the poop to come out   If you could remember the reason I would like to know   I always thought by myself that laying to the right should have been easier because the stool will be going downwards from large intestine to the rectum  Guess I was wrong to think like that I ve just started using Enemeeze They work great and faster than magic bullet It works for me within 2 3mins Try them out You can ask your doctor to prescribe you them or get them online Accessible car service for New York CityI was there a year ago and there was a line for cabs at La Guardia and the people there helped get an accessible cab Same deal at my hotel  up scale near Times Square   Are you looking for a car service for the whole time or just for a couple rides to airport and what not Also are you in a power chair or manual I found nyc to be pretty easy to get around in my chair between buses and subway Plus there is a ton of accessible cabs so you can just call them up and get one if you know what you re doing before hand and don t want to hoof it   I am going to be traveling in my manual chair but I am usually in a power chair I just don t trust the airlines to handle my power chair and not break it  we just need a ride from the airport to our hotel and then back to the airport when we are ready to leave We are coming in for a banquet that will be at the hotel Wheelchair GlovesThese Gloves for Life https   www glovesforlife com mobile  are great for gripping the rim to push In your case you may need to put on some thin gloves underneath them for the cold  For over twenty two years I have been using Hatch gloves Specifically tp100C I know that looks like a pointless product number but it s the easiest way to search for them and find them because there are a lot of different types of gloves like that out there   For a while recently there was a huge back order and I was very concerned that they were going to be discontinued They also serve as a very effective Universal cuff for me and I rely on that velcro around my knuckles to hold everything from tools to writing instruments and kitchen utensils Thankfully they seem to have come in stock with new packaging and so I hope they will be here for another 20 years Just to be safe I bought 14 pairs wherever I can find them because I depend on them so much I m sure they could be custom made but these are made very well and I d rather just stick with the ones I can pay and Bill to Insurance   Now the downside the rubber is great the lack of fingers in winter is not I live in about the middle of Saskatchewan so one look on a map and you can tell that are winters are a little bit more brutal than our Southern Neighbors   That s pretty much the gist of what you need to know If you have coverage a lot of medical supply places carry them If not I ve seen them on amazon com but I don t know how readily available they are I purchased from multiple US sellers and had them imported in the past so there are lots of options when you find them   Hopefully that helps and I d be happy to answer any additional questions to the best of my ability Let us know what you found Maybe there s a newer better product out there than what I ve been using for a long long time  Hey there I m not a quad but I have frequent dislocations in my wrist and fingers so I use gloves to help my hands not have to grip as tight I also live in the snowy mountainous area of the east coast Think  wet snow   I prefer leather gloves because when dry they allow a little slide but a lot of natural grip Leather is great because you can put waterproofing spray or gel on the gloves and it helps it not absorb all the water and moisture When  good  leather or lambs skin gets wet it doesn t irritate my delicate skin Lambs skin drawback is I would probably burn through those even quicker than I burn through my leather padded ones If you need super grip I have a really nice Head brand glove that I use for wheelchair tennis Much grip Not sure about it s weatherproofing abilities though  Snowmobile mittens Build quality varies but some of them should work pretty well If the palm needs a little help you could always coat it with a roof sealant from the hardware store   deleted  I had a pair of those Loved them Without any finger dexterity you really need something that will grip the push rim I just wish there was more wrist protection My husband has a pair of these from the rehab hospital He calls then dycem gloves These look nice thanks It looks like they have nice wrist protection too What do you do to protect your fingers in the winter then These look nice thanks Thanks I ll have to check them out Hand controls for someone who still has pretty good decent leg function I m that guy and while I am perfectly comfortable driving normally I still have hand controls in my car Better to have them and not need them  Did the way I drive with my feet make sense   Glad to hear your story and I can t disagree The few close calls I ve had have left me wondering if it s something I should look into The only drawback is that I share a car with my significant other and I believe permanent hand controls are expensive no Can you tell me where and how to get them My husband needs them and we can t figure it out Thank you Steroid advice in SCI rehabI m thinking testosterone it s produced naturally and from what I understand it drops a lot when your spinal cord is injured sooo maybe I m C2 Injured in August 2010  Cycling since January 2012  I mainly just cruise now  Am also a physical therapist with S C background     x200B   My main recommendation is to take   1 year or so of proper 5 day a week gym work before hopping on  You want to have made good natural progress first and make sure you ve regained as much function as possible  You also want to be sure you know how to train and make gains naturally  This way you ll maximise the effects of a cycle  Diet for lifting is still extremely important     x200B   Be aware   If you have big discrepancies in strength due to the injury on a neurological level a cycle will only increase that gap  This could lead to some odd looking aesthetics  No he won t even think about it so I might just try my on my own after I do some research I m T9 11 incomplete and I ve thought about trying it also but I can t my Dr to help me I ve been told by my Dr and spinal physio no go that it won t have the same effects as for a fully functional body builder  I have a very weak left leg so I d be interested to hear if others have had any success  Hey so if you can t basically do every exercise at the gym and progress on every lift naturally you really shouldn t be messing with extremely suppressive drugs because you won t even be able to take full advantage of the hormones Imo  I am not a physical therapist nor a doctor or anything  if I were you I d be using some anavar at probably 20 40mg day to aid you during physical therapy this will not suppress your natural testosterone production to the extent that a full blown testosterone enanthate injection cycle will  it still will suppress you though and you should still do a PCT after  while still giving you an edge during your therapy and giving you some strength increase Keep in mind this is all anecdotal and you will be doing this at your own risk     https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC4629627   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC4629627     This is a study conducted about the effects of anavar on a neurologically ill person the interesting part of the study is in the limitations where the researches claim that anavar really helped spinal cord injured people  yeah i heard that too im doing some hunting on the web and il see what i snag on here to then maybe try a small dose have you been to the doc and got test levels checked ect thanks for the reply mate yeah i had thought about the potential implications to aesthetics neuro wise i think i got off lightly well as light as you can with an SCI i have about 60  power in my right leg and with a brace on my left i can pull up to my feet and stand with a walking frame i was hoping the extra strength boost could allow me to get a step or two in  i havent trained since my injury but previously i used to keep fit boxing kicking and gym but i think you could be onto something maybe its wise to get a decent amount of time in at the gym and re asses in a few months ect also my diet is not on point either atm so thats another smart place to start  thank you for your inputthanks for the reply in my head it makes sense weak muscle   exercise   juice should   gains  im just a little worried about the post cycle recovery process and i dont wanna break anything else  yeah im along the same lines its gotta work to a certain degree surely  if you can move it naturally then surely theres scope to add resistance and therefore increase the mass   im not a doc so im just assuming i was hoping this post would have gained a bit more traction   im still asking about il keep you informedperfect response thank youQuestion about spinal fusion and marching bandHonestly man you re probably going to have to sit out  I d try seeing a physical therapist who specializes in post spinal surgery and see if there s much that can be done to strengthen it but don t count on it  I was a pretty avid runner before my fusion and now anytime I run I get electric shocks from my legs to my spine so I m a walker now  It sucks but we just have to adapt  Front Ensemble Wearing a snare drum requires a bit of spinal extension  leaning back with a lot of pressure on your low back  which obviously could make your back hurt after a fusion Marching is hard work and your back may not be ready for that much less while trying to carry a drum as well See if you can get some therapy  tell them specifically what you want to work on  and see if there s a front ensemble you can join this year  Yeah I figured i d have to sit out it kinda sucks but it d rather have to sit out than try to march and mess something up thanks for replying though Thank you for the reply Unfortunately my school does not have a front ensemble so I wont be able to march with snare For some games we don t march though so i ll be able to play there Also my director said I could probably be switched out with a cymbal player since cymbals wouldn t hurt my back as much BPC 157 Injections for Spinal Cord HealingFrom the links you ve posted it looks like the results you re talking about were seen in studies conducted on rats I m not saying that s a bad thing   it s the first major step towards even getting approval for trials in humans But I think it s important to remember two things   1  Results from studies conducted on rats don t always translate perfectly to humans   2  You will come across studies like this some with different methods and mechanisms that may even show results in select humans but it s important to remember that they re almost always in really early trial stages and that getting accepted into a trial like these is not easy They choose their participants wisely   I am  not  saying abandon all hope I m just saying keep these things in proper perspective Your time and energy is almost always better spent on things like OT PT and learning to live and navigate the world with whatever function you currently have Maintaining hope to some degree can be an incredibly effective source of motivation but it can also trap you in a headspace where even significant gains in your ability to live as you are can feel not good enough because you re stuck chasing what you used to be capable of   I live my life expecting nothing better than what I currently have when it comes to function If someday that changes and a new treatment or therapy comes out that offers a chance at increased function and or ability it will be a wonderful surprise and something I would absolutely pursue But in the meantime I m going to live my life to the fullest with what I ve got and work my ass off to maintain the highest level of function I m currently capable of I don t want to waste any of the precious time I do have just because I m waiting on some kind of panacea that will allow me to go back to the way things were before The knowledge that our time here on Earth is over so quickly and is really no time at all in the grand scheme of things drives me to work with what I ve got   And just a note   maintaining that kind of attitude isn t always easy In fact I d argue it s the most difficult thing I ve ever done Depression is something I struggle with and that I ve worked hard to manage There are absolutely times where I hit a limit and end up feeling frustrated and sad that my future is no longer what I once thought it would be Most of the time however I refuse to let my physical limitation dictate the quality of my life and so I actively fight back against those negative feelings and at times channel them into making myself work harder to live a better life right now Bad days are inevitable but they don t need to be the norm I find I do better living a life of acceptance rather than one where I m constantly searching for a way to make things easier   whether that s being able to walk again a better way to manage chronic pain or just other small things that might make my life a little bit easier I used to think it was a cheesy thing to say but life really is what you make it I ve met individuals with complete cervical SCIs that live more meaningful and happy lives than some ABs in my life   And if you the OP didn t need to to hear any of this I hope that it reaches someone else who did I didn t get to this place of acceptance overnight It took me years of being miserable and depressed to gain the perspective I have now I can only hope to help others avoid wasting the years that I did on all the  what ifs  and  whys  because it was exactly that kind of thinking that landed me in a serious depressive episode   If anyone ever wants to chat feel free to DM Nothing is too small or too stupid and I don t judge Nothing would make me a bigger hypocrite than judging someone for struggling with their day to day reality when it literally

not SCI but peripheral nerve injury Stuff being injected immediately after the injury  Following Following Any links to the case studies Will do my own research also but interested as to what your sources are     I posted mainly because I m interested in human optimization  due to my injury I am on TRT currently and have been researching peptides for sake of being a guinea pig myself in hopes of optimizing my own healing process I have had positive results from TRT and hope to continue with potential peptide use coupled with stem cells   I am only 10 months out from quadriplegia and am living quite a full life currently backpacking SE Asia alone using walking as my PT and day to day life in hostels as my OT  climbing bunk beds navigating large steps etc  But to your point yes I am just as you seem to be very matter of fact with my injury  every neurological leap I ve seen mainly in the last 6 months had been welcomed happily although not always expectedly  I mean really just curiosity I m not expecting a miracle cure or for anyone to come forward and say  hell yeah partner I m sprinting hills now  otherwise we d all be pumping ourselves full of peptides right now   There s an array of peptides out there that people are utilizing with success this is just one I came across that seemed interesting enough to ask abouthttps   www researchgate net publication

and real sensation Many times I have experienced pain in a limb only to look at it and see it s in a different position than I thought so the pain is not where the limb is but where I thought it was if that makes sense That s how I personally know  The pain is real whether is from nerve damage or otherwise   This week I knocked a sharp knife off the counter and cut my leg and felt nothing but I also have painful tingling that changes intensity with no obvious cause as side from nerve damage mild spinal swelling It just confirms that I need to stay vigil about pressure sores and other types of wounds below my injury level because I don t have sensation Talk to your PM R doctor  physiatrist  about the neuropathic pain There might be something they can do to help  I take a lot of Lyrica and other meds to stop the neuropathy pain Plus CBD gummies the Lyrica does a good job but nothing compared to the gummies  Unless you have an injury at the place you feel the pain it s probably neuropathic pain Its possible you only have pain sensation and no other sensation  touch heat proprioception  You can test this by having someone poke you with a toothpick with your eyes closed  u aabbcc28 the comments From what I understand nerve pain is typically at the level of injury I have nerve pain and it is at my nipple line feels like a damn knife is getting poked into me I also understand that there is bandular pain I believe that it means that the pain wraps around the entire body in that spot  When it comes to figuring out nerve pain is time out from injury and other symptoms Again from what I understand is that it starts showing up 6 8 weeks after injury  that s what my doc said and that s when mine started  I do also experience tenderness in my nipple areas I know that there is also a range when it comes to nerve pain but every sci I ve talked to me included is that when it hits and I missed my medicine holy shit is it debilitating IDK if any of this helps I would very much ask your doctor  This I know this is an super archaic term but I just call it phantom pain or phantom sensation I know that isn t the right term but it s what I ve always heard growing up I ve been thinking about cbd  and honestly just smoking grass in general  what kind of gummies and what strength do you use I am also on lyrica 300mg twice a day Hasn t really helped much I don t know about gummies There are a lot of fake cbd ones out there and I don t know which one to trust Incomplete c5 6 and getting worse   wheelchair add on I picked up this last week and I am absolutely in love with it It is a total game changer for me https   youtu be l_PJb Rsi50 Try to test drive a smart drive and get by with that for as long as you can you lose a lot of convenience with a power wheelchair   you will now have to consider whether any surface you roll onto can support the 300 400lb chair plus your weight And you will only be able to transport the chair in a vehicle set up for it  Smartdrive is very popular Just be careful swinging it into your trunk  boot   to avoid rotator cuff injuries   If the wrist flexor spasticity is impairing you function try some botulinum toxin It may help your wheel stroke pattern  that looks awesome   probably be a good gardening accessory for me as my yard has a bit of an incline and pushing up a grade on grass gets old quickThanks for the botox tip   I ll bring it up to my doctor at the next meeting And yeah i don t wanna go for the electric chair because of those reasons   though I hadn t considered the thu g about surface support   I ll ask about smartdrive   thanksComfortable wheelchair deleted  Depending on where the individual lives a wheelchair specialist should evaluate your friend Check with any Permobil or Mobility Works dealership and ask for referrals Good luck  Make sure the physician and therapy team know that the chair is limiting his participation in rehab  That is something they can use to justify a better chair through insurance  A proper fit wheelchair is extremely important  Echoing what others have said definitely consult professionals about a chair A proper place will measure him and ensure everything is the right size and properly supported Commonly people use a seating specialist company that act as middleman between consumers and chair companies  and they deal with all the insurance bullshit that goes along with buying a chair   I personally use National Seating and Mobility but it all really depends on where you are located PT OT at your family member s facility should know what to use   Also something worth noting You said he s newly injured  There is an adjustment period to wheelchairs even properly fitted ones Our bodies are not designed to sit all the time so discomfort is definitely a thing   early on especially  Not to discredit the ill fitting chair he has but encouraging him to just sit over time to get used to it is a good idea I remember while in rehab lying in bed was       sitting in the hospital chair  especially with back surgery recovery   the incision the staples the soreness from just wrecking my back    But the more he does it the easier it gets   Also to directly answer your question I have now had 3 chairs custom As a T12 complete the best so far as been the TiLite AeroZ  TiLite was recently acquired by Permobil  It s perfect in most ways Though again it s really going to be based on so many things no one can answer here  his height weight level of injury function etc     Good luck You probably know but your support in his difficult time is invaluable  I was feeding him a gyro yesterday He was still in bed but I knew that his dad was bringing in the family dog for a visit for the first time all summer and so I told a nurse that he d have to be gotten up They said they had to wait for someone to come but that they would be in very shortly   While I was feeding him the gyro his stepmom came in and said we d have to finish in the court yard I was in the middle of saying there was only a few bits left and I ll probably finish before the nurse comes in when she leaned across his bed and grabbed at his blanket I heard him start saying desperately  but im not wearing pants   And in the middle of that sentence saw an adult dipper I dropped the gyro and vacated out of respect for my older Male cousin Leaving all of my stuff in the room   But he shouldn t have had that happen to him She should ve respected him enough to ask permission before removing the blanket He should have more say in his life then that   A comfortable chair will make it so he wants to spend more time in it His father and step mom will get off the facilities back and his back The last thing I heard as I was leaving the room was how uncomfortable he said the chair was The thing is he s said it multiple of times in front of me and his father I asked his father about it and he said he sat in it for a bit and didn t see anything wrong with it There s a difference between a few minutes and a few hours though and I feel like this isn t just helping him get real food a few times a week this is different and bigger and I don t know how to make the right people do something about this and from the responses I got on here it sounds like I can t help with this   Rant over Thanks It s so hard though His father  family member is well over 18   Is difficult to deal with sometimes and he is the one who is listed as the person taking care of everything I d have to talk to him for that and I know he d either just brush me off or say he d handle it even though he doesn t have the money and then resent me for butting in I get that there is an adjustment period but he was at a facility until recently and never said anything about that chair Sure some days he d try staying in bed all day but he never once complained about the chair He isn t one to complain really That s how I know for certain that this chair is that bad   Thanks for your answer I talked to someone else in the family who is really good at talking to his father and I ll see if there is any progress made This whole thing sucks Bowel control programWe have the same injury  So from what you re saying you re doing the program in the morning but having accidents at night too   In the beginning I had the same problem Started the bowel program early in the morning and gave myself about an hour and a half  because that s what they taught in rehab  but it wasn t ever enough I was having accidents later on in the day during therapy and stuff which is extremely frustrating and embarrassing I decided to switch to nights and that got me on the right track I no longer had to worry about having an accident during any therapy or while being out and about The accidents were now happening throughout the night unfortunately lol So I just extended the bowel program first to 2 hours and then found 3 hours was like the perfect amount of time  I m not sure if you re taking any stool softeners or other bowel medications but I am and I ve had to adjust them either by taking less more or switching the times I now take 1 Colace in the morning with 2 Bisacodyls 2 Senna in the afternoon 1 more Colace at night and then use a suppository for the program Between giving myself more time and adjusting my medications I sorta found the perfect combination for me You also have to make sure to drink a lot of fluids and eat foods to help keep things moving   So basically it s a lot of trial and error You really have to pay attention to what your body is doing and just adjust things here and there I know it can get very frustrating but you ll get it with some time In my opinion you re better switching the program to nights to avoid the accidents possibly happening during something important Just start there  Sorry this is so long lol but if you have any questions or anything feel free to message me  just one comment  you half to do the trial and error After 31yrs I still read any info cuz I might be able to make things better From what I have read so far I am doing things right but I have not read this  Eating at least one bannana a day helps with the accidents  Bannanas help your body hold it in  Yeah he switched to nights and isn t taking as many stool softeners which has worked perfect for him and he hasn t had any accidents since  knock on wood  he actually just switched to every other day for BP Seated posture friendly sweatshirts Those are cute  If that s ok to say about a men s sweatshirt    Maybe try this group on FB I know the ladies there sell some things occasionally  like equipment    https   www facebook com groups 976128749251070  I think it is haha KB has some really nice well designed clothes   He has a couple pairs of their jeans and really likes them They don t have back pockets they re cut longer at the back so they stay in place and don t get weird gapping and the pockets are placed a little differently so they don t snag on his chair armrests and he can actually use them as pockets effectively   The downside is the customs we got charged when we ordered But Canada has a ridiculous import customs limit Thank you for the suggestion Do your toenails still grow I feel like mine grow more slowly I m guessing that has to do with limited circulation It could be mechanical but I m leaning towards blood flow  It s also going to be hard for you to gauge as you have atrophy over time I had size 13 feet in 1984 at the time of my injury Now I wear a 10 1 2  T5 they sure do  I ve gotten pretty vigilant about trimming mine after I tore one off  still no idea where and when it happened but it was a bloody mess  Neither my fingernails nor toenails grew for a while after my injury I just attributed it to the shock of the injury on my body They grow normally now  Mine do  I was injured 35  years ago  I have no idea if that is normal or not though  Since I have one affected side and one that s  mostly   unaffected finger  and toenail growth is   lopsided  T 4 5 here Mine grow normally as they used to before my injury I have lots of spasms so I keep them trimmed Don t want my toe nails stabbing me in the feet or worse tearing themselves off Scares the living daylights out of me  Funny mine seem to grow crazy fast yet thin  20 years post  Is there a circulation slow after all spinal cord injuries I injured one nail early on because my nails aren t growing I continue to have one black nail  Makes it look like one toe is painted a different color One of those times when you look at an injury and think  I m bloody glad I can t feel that Thank you maybe this is the answer since I m only 4 months in Thank you my fingers and toes used to grow at the same rate  On the flipside polish lasts and lasts With the affected side being slower by how much Question about recovery after spinal fusionI think it s less about the spinal fusion and more about the nerve compression and damage that necessitated the fusion   My husband was in huge amounts of pain before he had his surgery whereas now he only has numbness and tingling Unfortunately his surgery was delayed cos of the shitty insurance company so he s got mild foot drop do his sporting days are over   Have you been back to your Dr What have they said about your pain  Hey there  I m fused from T5 to L3 about the only thing i could do after surgery was weight lifting but i had to be careful not to over do it Pain was also a big part of my life as well since T4 lower wasn t fused all that weight from my upper body went there Not to scare you but i got the surgery when i was 17 21 now and nothing has helped Anxiety and depression became a factory in my life so much I tried everything from PT painkillers cannabis CBD and acupuncture Nothing worked  Chronic Pain might just be something you deal with for the rest of your life unfortunately Just stay strong and trying anything and everything you can or help subsidize the pain  How big  long  was your fusion  In other words from what level to what level    When you have a spinal fusion the vertebrae above and below the fusion will now be working harder than they were before  After my second fusion I m now fused from t5 all the way down to my pelvis and now my upper back and neck are experiencing pain from overuse    because those vertebrae are the only ones left that can move  You might be experiencing pain from something like this  of course you won t know until you go to your doctor   You might benefit from physical therapy  They may be able to teach you how to move to minimize discomfort or maybe even strengthen muscles around the area to take some pressure off your spine  7 months post fusion is still very soon imo  I wasn t able to do much of any of my  normal  activities until about a year later  unfortunately I haven t been back to my doctor in quite a while I made a trip back to the hospital around a month ago and I was supposed to have an appointment with him but it was canceled for some reason Yikes hope it isn t that but if it is I guess i ll just have to manage thanks for the reply I hope your pain gets better eventually The fusion is from T10 L3ATMI use Kelly clamps Works for gas pumps too Great around the house too   MABIS Kelly Forceps Medical Forceps Locking Forceps Silver 5 5  https   www amazon

your ATM transaction from the app on your phone and instead of using your card they ll give you a code to enter   Another option if you have an iPhone is adding the debit card to your virtual wallet and using the tap to pay feature at the ATM instead of inserting your card  GeniusThanks  Didn t even think abt the gas station That ll be super helpful in the future I usually use two hands but I like this Wow thank you for this idea Thanks  Success stories for people with spinal injuries and back break from T11   L1This is a tough situation Generally I think health care providers thread the needle with not wanting to give false hope but not wanting to make situations seem without hope for improvement especially with incomplete injuries like your cousin s Truth is everyone s injury is different so remind your cousin not to compare himself to others in recovery Encourage him to work work work as much as possible but keep a dose of reality that there will likely still be some deficits It s great to see people s recovery stories but not everyone is the same I wish you guys the best  The thing about spinal cord injuries is that they are HIGHLY varied and therefore can be difficult to predict at the onset on injury Most injuries have little chance of much recovery which is why doctors always say  Little chance of walking again  The severity of the injury will manifest itself in the days following the injury 5 days post and raising a knee and moving feet is a very good sign that shows he will recover a good bit Consider him extraordinarily lucky How much he can recover will be determined in the next few weeks to months Rehab will let him reach the maximum potential his injury will allow But to keep expectation in line please understand recovery is more determined by injury severity not necessarily work ethic You can work your whole life but the body won t regrow a severed limb The spinal cord is no different   I wish him the best in recovery T11 L1 is very low and his QOL will be very high still post injury  The other two comments are spot on I just wanted to add    Successful rehab and walking are not the same thing and it can be really discouraging to link the two  It s going to be a long process and there are many losses associated with a spinal cord injury beyond the use of the legs Don t focus so much on the legs that you forget about the person No one is less successful or less of a person because they no longer walk after an injury  Well I had a T12 burst fracture in 2007 a fusion and though I do take gabapentin for some peripheral neuropathy in my ankles feet I am probably 99  It did take a rough first year and then a more steady year to figure that out but if he is moving  at all  he is likely going to be able to regain a lot of function They had me doing things I couldn t really understand the day after surgery  all range of motion things but I imagine if they see any movement they go at it In general they say you regrow something like 1  a month that was basically my experience   it plateaus at some point but I m forever grateful for the function I regained as well as the excellent surgeons and care staff Good luck he seems already on the lucky side and do encourage him to consider this a long ride there are no fast responses  I crushed my T11 and T12 last year had to have the fused from T8 to L3 I was told straight away I would never walk again never have bowl or bladder control After 4 months in the hospital I was able to walk with a cane and now a year later I can walk without a cane short distances and walk with my cane for about 10 minutes   I know that s not great but it s still improving I found that I always did my exercises and pushing myself to the max but no one can really tell with nerves   Message me if you want I m happy to help    I fractured my back at L1 and a year later I am walking with a cane I do however feel chronic pain constantly in that area The best thing to do is just to be there for your cousin This is an extremely hard thing to go through It does sound really promising though the somewhat movement that he has already had Spinal cord injuries unfortunately are really hard to predict The thing with a sci is trying to get used to a new normal whatever that may be  I think your right there I get you it s just nice sometimes to know other people have done it Thank you Hand spasmsMy boyfriend is a C4 5 6 Asia B 2 years post and also used to play guitar Most of his spasms are in his legs  they stiffen up but don t shake  but oftentimes his core arms and hands will stiffen up as well His fingers dig into his palms but they don t extend outward   He has seen a little return in his left thumb He can extend it on command and we re working on getting it to press down We play silly modified versions of thumb war which gets his mind trying to move it without some of the frustration attached There s a quad on YouTube named Mason Ellis who has a few videos of his hand exercises stretches and the workouts he does with theraputty It might be worth checking out   He says to be careful with the Baclofen We re in the process of weaning off of it because the benefits didn t outweigh the risks attached It only seemed to work for a week or so before the spasms would come back just as strong as before We also aren t comfortable with the fact that Baclofen is his only medication that has deadly withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly Tizanidine has been helpful but it makes him sleepy He takes it an hour before we stretch  so he doesn t kick me in the face lol  then we go to bed   We ve learned that everyone has a different injury especially if it isn t complete The break may be in the same place but symptoms can be totally different so take everything with a grain of salt   Hope this helps  I get spasms in my hands and fingers I suffer with horrible spasms If I didn t have the baclofen pump I would be in a fetal position and not able to move without severe spasms I m not even exaggerating If it is interfering with you being able to pick stuff up I would say talk to your Dr about possibly increasing the dose For me when they put the baclofen pump in they pointed the catheter upwards a bit so that it would calm down my hands I m not sure what they can do other than increasing those dose  I have trauma induced SM around c4 c6 and on my right hand I get really bad pain and spasms It both hands go numb my right wrist will shake when it s overused Also my joints feel weak I can t hold my fingers up with my right hand The joints in my nuckles make my fingers want to drop and it s not an issue with my left Sometimes if I am holding something I feel like I need to drop it  I have shooting pains and weakness in my shoulders and arms a lot  Thank you for all of this information I sympathize with your boyfriend My guitar was my life and having to lose that essentially overnight and not having my biggest stress relief during the most stressful time of my life has been one of the most difficult things to deal with with this injury   I haven t had too many issues with the baclofen but also have not tried weaning off and seeing what happens I also take gabapentin and bladder spasm meds but just had a bladder Botox procedure so I m hoping it ll help with leaking   Good luck to you and your boyfriend as you continue on this journey Spinal cord abcessProbably not the most appropriate sub to post this on but I ll give my  0 02   First congratulations on your sweet baby  At this point I wouldn t worry too much about an epidural abscess  By the way they are VERY rare following epidural anesthesia for childbirth     Things to look for would be radiating lower back pain increased pain when lying down tingling or numbness in your legs or genital area inability to control bowel or bladder function Sounds like you might have come into the hospital with something since you had the low grade fever and it might have worsened Also if your membranes were ruptured for over 24 hours you might have developed chorioamnionitis for which you would have received antibiotics during labor   Your symptoms would be much more severe if you had a rip roaring epidural abscess   I had an epidural with both my kids and was sore afterwards at the insertion site I also had these weird  zing  pains every now and again at the insertion site that went away after a few days   Try not to worry Your body is recovering from having a baby and that s a big job It s normal to have some degree of soreness afterwards since you re not really getting to lie around and sleep recover all the time   That being said by all means if your pain gets worse or changes to something that seems out of the ordinary OR matches the things I described above definitely seek care immediately   Hope this helps calm your fears a little Enjoy your little one as much as possible I suspect if your doctor was really worried about your blood cultures being positive you wouldn t be home right now  I don t have experience with this particular issue but I 100  know this  you brought life into this world and that means you can handle this You are strong beyond believe and able to endure Keep a positive mindset and your child in mind and you ve absolutely got this no matter what the situation is  Rest is just as important for the mind as it is the body in my experience Take some time for yourself  as much as you can with a new baby anyways  and maybe even away from social media if you re that kinda person Either way you ve got mom strength and you will absolutely make it through this   Edited to make sense It s a been a long day and I can t word right no more  How are you feeling Feel free to PM  This is a good reply A fever is a generalized sign of infection and now just need to find the cause In your case there are a few potential sources of infection   I also had weird  zing  pains at my epidural site for about four months after delivery My doctor said that is normal I wouldn t let that make you think that it s the source of infection Other sources are more likely Im glad that you took the first step by being seen in the ER Follow up with your OB and continue to advocate for yourself to get this figured out I hope you feel better quickly so that you can enjoy this beautiful  but super difficult  time with your new baby and family Thank you for your reply I am not a regular reddit user and had no clue where to post this question  Additional info this is my third child I have had a horrible cough that hasnt gone away for over a month and is worse now than ever So I agree I think it s likely just a virus that I gotta kick but ugh it really really just scared me to death  Again thanks for all the info I will keep on monitoring my body and rest I dont want to rush to the ER for my overactive imagination Thank you for your words This is baby number three for me Definitely trying to soak it all in and stay strong too I m so exhausted and I know that has a lot to do with it How could I lift my C 7 SCI partner from ground level I love you honey  3 This is kind of hard to answer without an understanding of your partner s current level of function specifically hand arm function and core strength The best idea I can come up with off the top of my head would be to try and find some kind of portable surface that s like half the distance between the ground and their chair then transfer from the chair to that and then to the ground  or vice versa  It also depends on how capable you are of providing assistance and if you could do it safely Obviously your partner s safety but also yours   the last thing you wanna do is injure yourself   This is the best link to a video that kind of shows what I mean that I could find Not a huge fan of the name of the rehab place  Aim2Walk really   but it demonstrates the concept   https   youtu be 3S45As_x2kE  Hopefully others can provide some other ideas or suggestions I think it s incredibly sweet of you to even think about this and honestly I think the gesture in and of itself is romantic regardless of how you execute it Even having a second person to help with a transfer leave you wherever you want to be to spend time together  assuming it s safe  then have them return to help transfer back could work if you think your partner would be comfortable with that Having said that I do understand wanting to do this on your own   If I can think of any other ideas or things that might be helpful I ll add more I will say that having a SCI has made me learn some creative ways of doing things I ve been able to figure out a way to do almost anything I ve wanted to do thus far just sometimes it requires a little  or a lot    of out of the box thinking     Edit    I found a written breakdown of exactly how the transfer in that video works  https   ablethrive com life skills c5 quadriplegic demonstrates floor chair transfer    Better Edit    I also found this video which I ve gotta say is a pretty awesomely creative way of getting up off the ground It would only work with a manual chair though I d imagine  https   youtu be eXVv4uuBKOw    Final Edit    Last video but this one is the same injury level as your partner  which I know doesn t necessarily mean that it ll work but here you go   https   youtu be NZPD47yPqHw  If you Google and or YouTube  floor to chair transfer quadriplegic  you ll find some more ideas and demonstrations My absolute last suggestion would be to maybe try this somewhere safe and where you can grab an extra person if necessary before you go to a park and end with your partner stuck on a blanket     There s plenty of techniques on how to pick up and carry an unconscious person  I know that your girlfriend aren t unconscious but if she s c7 complete without to much spasms the techniques should be transferable to your situation  I recommend that you and your partner research and practice the most convenient of those techniques e g at home Practice makes perfect   edit  grammar  Do the firemens pick up for safety although it doesn t look elegant it gets the job done the easiest  I have been in this situation a while back It s tough I m a C6 7 Quadriplegic and this happened when I was with my mom What we did was sit me up against a couch and I tried to lift my butt as she slid books under me It helped elevate me enough to help get me on the couch then we transferred me back to the wheelchair It s not perfect but it worked I don t recommend picking him up completely by yourself because you can easily throw out your back  I love you bothI love you too cabbage anything for you honey   Thank you so much this is excellent What an informative post can t wait to have a goTHIS IS FOR ALL MY SCI BRETHEREN WHO DON T FEEL LIKE YOU RE ENOUGH Join me on Live on 9 11 19 at 8 pm eastern the anniversary of my accident as I reflect on the day and share some thoughts I had my accident on the same day our nation was attacked September 11 2001 I ll be reflecting on the day https   www youtube com channel UCCPF53OFxqpUr1a32NshBNwMy fingers are starting to curl inPersonally I prefer my curled up as I can hook things easier and means my tenodesis is more effective  My fingers curled completely but they re not flat by any means My OT gave me some splits to wear to help straighten my fingers but didn t use them for very long  5 6 weeks  as I found them clunky are kept catching on things  Physical therapist here   you actually want your fingers to be able to maintain that curled position There s something called the  tenodesis grip   which refers to using your active wrist extension  which facilitates automatic finger flexion  for grip purposes when you don t have those wrist and finger flexion muscles It s extremely functional and helpful at your level of injury Stretching the fingers out can actually decrease this grip mechanism over time  I usually sleep with my head on my hands to keep them flat not terribly comfy but seems to help  I m just over 8 years in and I agree with a lot of the people here for the most part The curling does help with holding and picking up some objects I still stretch out my fingers throughout the day and my right hand can lay flat without any help My left hand is more tight because I use it to hold my phone all the time There are advantages to both but I think they will almost always eventually curl  I have been a C6 quad since 1993 Curled fingers are a must but be wary of contractions Stretch your fingers daily  I am with you on this If I had flat hands I would not have very much grip at all Now if I hook my finger around something it is going to hold onto it for the most partWhat about maintaining a sort of  in between  I m just thinking about like holding cups or shaking hands or something and I still don t want them to get too closed upI slept on mine too to open them upWhat regular check ups should someone with a SCI be having In my experience having a once yearly appointment with a physiatrist  Doctor who specialises in physicals medicine physical rehabilitation medicine  has been the best way to go They seem to have all the necessary knowledge and a much much greater understanding of any day to day challenges and healthcare needs   From there if I need to see a specialist I can get a referral from my physiatrist if I don t have an already established relationship with the doctor I need to see Otherwise the only other healthcare professionals I see are my family provider  a NP   I preferred her approach over a doctor s  and occasionally a physical therapist   Having said that this is my experience Others may have different ones or have other suggestions  Urologist Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation potentially a Pulmonologist or dietician It depends on your injury level and your greatest challenges It s also a good idea to consult a digestive health doctor to check things like your liver enzymes and nutrients in your blood They help make sure that your medicine regimen is working well with your body Finally a Hematologist as lack of movement makes us susceptible to blood clots especially in the legs  aka Deep Vein Thrombosis   PM R Doc Urologist General Practice Doc are the ones that come to mind for me  Annual visit with physiatrist for first 5 years post injury  Rental ultrasound annually  ordered by a GP  Cystoscopy x every 2 years  ordered by urologist  Follow ups as needed with GP I see a spinal consultant annually This will then include annual X ray and ultrasound of the bladder and kidneys to check for stones primarily The session with the consultant will include a discussion regarding how things are going and may then lead on to further referrals  I see a GP when I need a med refill  others as needed when I have an issue with something  maybe I have been doing it wrong   52 22 years post injury I didn t know about physiatrists thanks  Good ideas here thanksAdvice for a naive partner Hi there I m also a partner I recommend the WAGS  wives   girlfriends of SCI  group   if you re on

fracture in his c4 or c5 he couldn t feel anything immediately except pins and needles in his legs He was able to move his legs slightly 1st 24hrs and have feeling in his arms but no movement in upset beyond belief Please give me any informationInformation for you your father his Dr  s and to read up on resources available in your area your should visit  the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation  https   www christopherreeve org  I cannot stress enough how useful this site will become to you Best wishes to you both  hang in there  Well first Ill say I am sorry to hear about your dad A spinal cord injury at any age is never easy to deal with unfortunately for people your dads age they don t exactly have time on their side this makes recovery challenging on the positive side it sounds like he is already able to move his legs that should get slightly better over time but not likely to recover to the point before the injury hopefully he will recover to the point of being able to stand or take a few steps even for a small amount of time just to pivot to seat to seat But only time will tell  that may sound devastating and terrible because its hard for you to put your dad in that kind of situation But standing to pivot or take a few steps is a massive accomplishment Something I wish I could do    his paralysis is fairly high so he may require a tracheotomy breathing tube for the first little while   his blood pressure and temperature gauges are going to be all out of whack for a while I like to tell people that the thermostat is no longer connected to the furnace so the furnace is not warming or cooling when it should   he had a cervical spinal cord injury which means his hands will more than likely be damaged and he will have difficulty grabbing or gripping the ways he used to before If he has any grip at all   try to get him in as much rehab as he can handle The first six months are extremely important on an individual recovery   make sure he is sleeping or resting on a good memory foam mattress it doesnt need to be a hospital bed but making sure he does not develop pressure sores is probably one of the most important things you are going to help him with on his recovery Pressure sores are killers   try and make sure he is comfortable is what made me feel the most normal after my injury I was injured at 20 years old and I went through some pretty massive depression waves I had my youth taken away from me Your dad is not in the same situation but I can imagine there are some pretty dark and confusing thoughts floating around his head right now talking to a therapist is probably just as important or more important than his physical recovery at this stage of his life make sure he talks to a therapist regularly   other than that there are plenty of resources online to keep you busy reading If you have any questions just ask we are pretty friendly community   good luck dad  Hey not a doctor but my dad aso had a high spinal cord injury so if you ever want to talk and process I m all ears  Thank youThank you for the insight and information it s been 72 hours and he can bend his legs and lift his arms No movement in his hands He has fractured his c4 and c5 Also the doctors have not elected for surgery so I think he is recovering well I think they have diagnosed him with central cord syndrome I know it s going to be a long road I m holding on to the fact that he has improved slightly every day If you have any insights please Let me knowThank you it s been 72 hours and he can bend his legs and lift his arms No movement in his hands He has fractured his c4 and c5 Also the doctors have not elected for surgery so I think he is recovering well I think they have diagnosed him with central cord syndrome I know it s going to be a long road I m holding on to the fact that he has improved slightly every dayDifferent positions during sex for T6 injurySex chair and wedges I m trying to remember the name of them but it gives me the  power  of thrust I m t6 as well   Edit  liberator I ll try and find a link  https   www intimaterider com  Sorry but I m gonna hijack your question real quick I m a t8 injury but I can t even maintain an erection Does your bf take meds and if so what works or other options Also I can t imagine many other positions without an anchored swing of some sort  I m a T5 and I m able to get on top in a bed What I do is have my gf lay to right and then I lean over to her and sort of throw my left leg over across her body and then just get in a push up position If my legs don t flatten out she pushes them back with hers Then I just sort of hump her until I can t hold myself up anymore lol A little clumsy but she enjoys it Thank you we ve been looking at wedges but weren t sure if one would be worth it I like the idea of the chairs though He does have some cialis that we ll use on occasion if he has trouble but most the time there s no problem Another thing he s found helps a lot with sensitivity and being able to maintain up is marijuana CBD products And it s majority me on top in different positions Another thing that we used to use was a cock ring but we ve found that the more sexually active we are the easier a time he has with getting hard and maintaining Difference between cord compression pain and spasticityThings might be getting betterYou could ask your urologist about bladder augmentation surgery They take a piece of your bowel and add it to your bladder so it can hold more urine I had this operation done in the beginning of the year and so far it s been great Except one time when I ate some medical marijuana THC butter I got some excruciating pain near the area I got a CT scan and everything was normal Other than that it s convenient because I can hold up to 600 ml until I start getting AD symptoms Some cons would be  pretty big scar surgery can have complications possible long stay in the hospital I ll add some more if I can think of anything else Good luck  Self adhering catheters made by  Bard  will not leak when put on properly I ve been using them since they came out   never had a leak sure beats cathing 6 10 times a day Botox works well to stop bladder spasms BUT must be done every 5 6 months I have come to love condom caths  It took a lot of trial and error to figure out how they work best but it s worth it  You can t leave urine in there very long or it will loosen the adhesive and then will spill out  I also try and get it on as high up as I can so it covers as much of the penis as possible and pinch the top so there s no air  Strangely enough I have found if I only leak a little it seeps down and removes the adhesive quicker than if it fills up so I do try and drink a lot of water  Multiple bathroom stops is the downside of course  I too have an incomplete spinal cord injury Something that I noticed was causing me to have issues was whenever I had a bladder infection I am assuming that you may have had issues with those as well That could be contributing to things I am taking Utiva uti infection control and that seems to be helping I have heard that Botox can help too I guess the only thing to make sure to find out is if it helps in people that can not have any ability to hold their bladder at all I hope you find something that helps  Yep you need the scan Botox only works on certain types of bladder dysfunction and incomplete folks don t always have the type of neurogenic bladder that Botox treats I am surprised he didn t order urodynamics  where they fill you with saline til you leak to test your bladder reflex responses  and cystoscopy   Botox involves 20 tiny injections into your bladder wall to weaken it so it is less prone to contracting under stress and emptying your bladder unexpectedly If your bladder is voiding when you stress it it might help you by reducing an overly active empty response If it s a sphincter only issue botox might not be the only answer The only downsides to Botox is that it can weaken tone in the area around your bladder that you might rely upon ie your stomach muscle tone helping you with transfers  It also can be expensive if you have no coverage There s a small chance of UTI each time so they often put you on a short course of antibiotics ahead of the injections   For me it took my tiny very spastic 100 mL bladder to a 350  ml bladder I now only catheterize 4x day and have no leaks when transferring which was my most common problem I have to set an alarm to remind me to pee though because Botox removes my sensation of needing to pee   I m really sorry you missed out on the basics but if it makes you feel better Botox was only used for bladder dysfunction starting 12 years ago  Do you use any strong disinfectant to keep your catheter clean  I m glad to hear augmentation worked for you The only guys I know who had it done have had major complications so ive always been concerned it s a last resort procedure   OP there are also urinary diversion surgeries you can get that your doc could tell you about   mitrofanoff where they use part of your appendix to create a stoma on your lower belly or in your navel that you can catheterize through There s one called a suprapubic diversion where they create a small opening above your pubic bone that an in dwelling catheter can go through These are both done along with bladder augmentation surgeries often times and depend on your needs and function Bard condom catheters leak after the first spasm If they don t leak then why are my pants wet after useing them for 30 yrs    how do ya put them on properly Sorry it took so long to respond I am finally at a point in my life I can concitrate on my bladder and penis care I am trying a new urologist and am almost done with 3 basic tests and I am arming myself with info to ask him and see if we can come up with a good plan or if I need another doctor I really thank ya for the info ya gave me on condom cath  I have been useing them the wrong way for about 28 years  I have some very serious Questions I need to ask you cuz you seem to know what I need to know about condom catheters     I don t know how to work this site yet so I ll take a chance maybe can I write my email  I really have a very pressing question that only you can answer me alone please get back     x200B   QI used to reuse catheters up to a whole year without even washing it once  so I go t infection every month  now I use a new one every time I cath  I wear rubber gloves now to so I haven t had an infection in over a year and don t plan on gettting one again unless it is from some doctor  I don t cause them anymore I have been liveig alone for so long I know how to be okay alone but I am craveing company the kind that care if ya play with yourself and not ingnore it like drugies do  ever post is helping in some way THANK YOUAre you drinking enough water in a day Only peeing 1400  2000 ml a day Is there any link to marijuana and increased sensitivity Not THC but CBD yes indeed I m a C5 6 quad 27 yrs post just started a CBD regimen 7 mos ago I notice heightened sensation everywhere  patchy areas feel more intense etc  I dont have a spinal injury but yes there is definitely heightened sensitivity everywhere I love doing yoga while smoking  I don t know that it s been scientifically studied and researched but I 100  think that there is a link as it causes the same effect for me and other quads I know  Marijuana also acts as a vasodilator hence the red eyes  but that increased blood flow similarity effects your sexual organs similarly to something like viagra I m sure it s a combination of different side effects but I always found that one particularly interesting  There s a lot of anecdotal evidence that seems to point towards the vasodilation properities of marajuana having a benefit and a decrease in nerve pain and from what I understand spasiticity as well   As far as I can see though there s insufficient actual scientific or medical evidence simply because the research isn t there This piece of  research  https   www nhs uk news neurology cannabis for nerve pain studied   that says it can reduce nerve pain though seems to point towards some regulation of abnormal cell firing being subdued so its possible that it in some way would impact sensation response  C5 7 inc here  I can corroborate the same effect to everything you stated  Lucky you figuring that one out 8mo in  I  m 20y  post I only figured a lot in that particular area in the past few years  Got a long road ahead of you   Cathing techniques to prevent or at least cutback on UTI s Don t use baby wipes  They re a breeding ground for bacteria Get an anti septic single use wipe usually sold in boxes of 100  for around the same prices as wipes    I assume you re showering daily and cleaning properly  Sometimes I use a hand sanitizer just to be safe or glove up if I can t wash my hands 100    Lastly I ve had good luck with Vitamin C twice a day  Anything that makes your bladder unfriendly to bacteria  Some people swear by a supplement by the name of  D Mannose  but I just found it to be pricey and not effective for myself  A few questions   Are you using baby wipes or antibacterial ones like Wet Ones Anecdotally I have heard that these work well and you can buy them single wrapped  I assume you re using single use catheters  What are you cathing into  Are you drinking enough water I know it s a balance  When you get UTIs are they testing to see what antibiotics the bacteria is sensitive to Wondering if you re ever really getting rid of it  Are you taking d mannose If not look into it You can get them at any health food store that sells supplements  For me cranberry extract pills worked wonderfully  As soon as I started taking one pill per day UTIs dropped significantly  Unfortunately the mechanism underlying the effects of cranberry on the residue bladder biofilm is not well understood so it can very from person to person but it is worth a try  Straight Cath won t empty my full bladderHave you tried irrigating your bladder I ve had blockages before and irrigating usually does the job You just take normal saline plug a catheter in  the one that has an opening  use the syringe and inject the saline and then pull it out with the syringe or drain it out normally  I have not tried that but hell I ll call my catheter supply company tomorrow I m so done pissing the bed I m almost out of my supply of chucks now Thank you for the adviceMy family and I were blessed to be able to stay at the beach for the weekend With my hubby s help I was able to walk down to the shoreline line I took this picture while standing unassisted It has been more than two years since I have been able to stand without assistive devices or help Amazing Congratulations I wish you nothing but incredible recovery it s all up from here Nice Congratulations  C 5 incomplete going into first year of Software Engineering Any things I need to know I am a C5 and am a software engineer full time I use a standard mouse and keyboard No adaptations I can keep up with my coworkers just fine I had the same concern as you It really is not an issue for employment Writing new systems from scratch is rare Most coding is spend debugging problems with existing systems which is more investigation and testing It s time spent thinking and not typing  The latest dragon software could save you time Being able to click thru screens super fast could be helpful  But I agree typing fast is nice for programming but it s debugging thinking that takes the time I m C5 6 very incomplete have a Master s degree in robotics engineering  before my sci  You really don t need to worry about the speed of your typing for programming   you ll spent 99  of your time thinking debugging banging your head on the desk because things aren t working and not actually typing   Before I recovered some of my hand function I was using Dragon voice recognition and it was very useful especially with custom macros I added  it can do pretty much anything you can imagine  however now I can type reasonably well I don t use it anymore  Also ask in r learnprogramming which has a huge amount of subscribers     at first my answer seems kind of dumb but I m sure people there have seen their share of adaptive tools and software  Thank you for your input Reading your post gave me some relief I m very excited for my C   class for this fall What kind of macros did you add I m a C4 C5 complete that is using Dragon for almost everything when coding I ve been getting a little faster but I m still quite slow Visiting a prostituteOP why did you post a question here 3 months ago saying you d been injured for 3 years   I was trying to find out whereabouts you were located in case it was somewhere there s an intimacy coach that could help and I stumbled across your earlier post  I ve never been to a sex worker but I think you should inform them about your condition before visiting them to see if they are comfortable Depending on the country where you re in there are specialized sex workers who deal with disabled clients You should visit them if they are available    Another thing you should keep in mind is that sex workers might not provide the intimacy that you re looking for because most of them don t allow you to kiss them and sex with Sci is pretty unorthodox since we cannot feel below our level of injury Good luck  do whatever makes you happy   but do research  maybe find an independent mature one who can talk to you through things   i dont think you would benefit from a 1 and done session where you pay for the company if you want to actually explore your sexuality just keep waiting for the right person  or find an independent escort who can help you figure it out and experiment   also just keep in find as a person with an SCI your immune system is weaker and you are prone to autonomic dysreflexia So it might not be a great idea to see a random person who has XX  of visitors a day im not judging anyone she can do whatever Im just suggesting as a person MORE SUSCEPTIBLE to illness contagious stuff and even stds    you should keep that in mind and be careful SCI is not fun so imagine adding syphilis or another fun STD into the dynamic lol   so yah to sum up   A  keep searching  tinder okcupid  match com  https   match com  etc   2  if you feel you must  then find an independent escort in your area who has experience with disability or search  sex surrogate      if you cant find any of that then just search for a MATURE INDEPENDENT ESCORT who can tal k to you before hand and learn about what you want That wat you can communicate and benefit from the experience and not just have an experience where you feel shitty afterewards sex does not equal intimacy  you will waste your money in my opinion Before seeking a prostitute I think you should find a Pleasure coach in your area This would help you knowwhat works for you and what doesn t It doesn t have to involve penetration but will help build your confidence as well as relieving your sexual desires a bit  A few thoughts  Is this a confidence building thing  Trying out your equipment to ensure you know what to expect before looking for a more conventional relationship  I ask as you aren t going to find intimacy with a sex worker  the preferred business name nowadays    Whatever you do DO NOT invite a sex worker    happy ending  massage therapist   etc into your home  You would be a great mark for getting robbed even if it s just small things and sadly we re known to have narcotics so we can be good targets for that as well   Other than that cover up you little man and play safe Safety should include the sex worker too when it comes to body fluids ie your bowel and bladder control  Take precautions beforehand so you aren t going to have to cath or whatever in a dirty and unknown bathroom  Make it known in advance what you are able to do or not do and what you are looking for  As always ensure the place is accessible  Thanks for the usefull answers   After some research I found an organization for my needs   First they do an interview to see what is necessary and stuff  True   I try to stay a little bit anonymous on the internet so I lied about the date of my accident   A little bit stupid I know But it gave me a better feeling   This summer it was five years ago Doing the important deep dive Have you ever pooped your pants Anyone who says they haven t is lying  Yep   It s pretty awful and luckily doesn t happen often I carry a whole extra outfit with me in my car just in case  Yes unfortunately it s rather common with an sci but if you can maintain a regular bowel program and eat fairly well you can avoid it I actually had a really bad case of cdiff that lasted 6 months and that really fucked me up  Many many times  I did even before the injury mate Most days are good but Thursday I was on underwear  3 by noon Transfer shower fresh pants and alternate seat cushion Reading all this comments made me feel better about wearing a diaper Thank you fellow PWD peeps  Not in a long time But yep Shit happens  I always wear a diaper so technically I never pooped my pants except a few times when I got diarrhea It was one of the few awful things that makes me wonder whether life like this is worth living or not  Yes especially at the beginning Now I have a fairly regular bowel program and I always wear a diaper I also bring a spare one when out Modern diapers are very easy to disguise even with skinny jeans  Funny enough I ve shit my pants less in the ten years after my injury than the ten years before  Three months  That is insane Hey not sure your level but have you gone are you going through the rigamarole and trial error that is establishing a bowel routine IIRC you re just a few months out but it can be done and is a big esteem booster to lose the adult briefs How do you do it When I wear a diaper it s so obvious even when I m wearing loose pants What options are available for a para who is no longer able to live at home with family due to not receiving the care they need  deleted  I was in a very similar situation living in my condo After my dad died I had to put my condo up for sale and relatively quickly transition to some other kind of existence where someone was able to help me 24 7  With the assistance of a  complex case management  team  this was a specialized social worker nurse and my primary physician  they helped me decide what I was willing to put up with knowing that I had to make a change For the first couple of years or so I moved into a group home   this is a private residence owned and operated by a retired nurse where she had two other residents occupying the other rooms Another option  which I did not like the sound of  was renting an apartment and hiring my own staff I would ve been more independent but it would ve been 10 times more work for me to maintain staffing and I would ve been left alone a lot more often Currently I m in an assisted living facility or a CBRF  community based residential facility  A nursing home is also known as a SNF  skilled nursing facility  If you visit either you re probably going to like the looks of the CBRF since it resembles something more like home but they re going to require you to be relatively trouble free For instance in Wisconsin the law states that a CBRF can reject you if you require more than nine hours of skilled nursing in a single week They can also discharge you involuntarily if you are in the hospital for 25 days or longer at a single time If you re in the hospital as often as it sounds like you are it might be more appropriate for a SNF to care for you until you can be left on your own safely I have spent many months in a few different ones with widely varying degrees of quality You re definitely going to want to shop around if you re able to before deciding on your next move Start by researching where you might potentially move in https   www medicare gov forms help resources find compare doctors hospitals other providers Try to avoid anything that s got only one or two stars Hit me up with any questions I d love to be able to help you even just a little  Have you asked your doctor for home health You could get nursing  for health management  OT  for adaptive equipment home modification overall independence with activities of daily living like bathing and dressing  and PT to get your strength back for function   Edit  also a medical social worker for all the types of options for placement you re interested in Home health really is the shit  You know part of the problem might be that you lash out at the people who are trying to help you Most people here are pretty friendly You ve come here for advice but have been somewhat vague and when asked for more information so they can better understand your situation you just shut them down We don t have a magic wand that will fix all your problems but we ve all been in a similar boat Have you thought of getting your own place Of the issue you need care at home is your home isn t accessible I would move  You need proper training on caring for yourself I m a T 1 Para who worked for 20 yrs in the chair teaching in a Vocational school   don t recall needing much assistance in the last 40 yrs of my injury unless I can t chance a light bulb of smoke alarm out of my reach If there is a Will there is a way  Yes is there another reason why you are not able to do these things for yourself For the most part I am pretty self sufficient but some of the things I can t do on my own really either come down to lack of mobility lack of knowledge or the house I live in  I am chronically ill and i feel like it has made me a shell of who I was at one point I hate going to the hospital and try to put it off as long as I can because every time I have been I end up getting admitted for 14 21 days and during that time I am not allowed to get into my wheelchair and move around I can t reach anything in my home because its filled with non disabled people who don t understand that I can t reach high on shelves or get around their debris Thank you for the genuine response I don t think I ll come back here when asking about things that include my paraplegia because I feel pretty offended that several of the comments where basically giving me a  but you are not even that much paralyzed tho   feeling which is ignorant and hurtful Your comment gives me hope for peopleThe home health options available in my area do nothing for me They take your blood pressure temp and then leave They won t assist with anything and I a limited to the state of my health from other factors No one is asking you to fix my issue and i am posiive that I am part of the promlem with the issues I ve written about but don t be deceived I don t think sharing my feelings is  lash  If the fact that I don t want to be either talked down to or told what I can and can t do and I said how felt in a reply to someone you must have a skewed view on what lashing out it In the thread if someone contributed something of merit or even a slight sympathy to my plight i reciprocated with kindness If the person immediately starts to ignore what I am saying and wants focus on my level of injury or what they think I can or can t do I don t show kindness If i have to pass some test by answering questions about my diagnosed diseases and issues that person can piss off It shows a lot about a persons character when they read something like i wrote and then have the nerve to be like  but you should be able to this let me compare my injury to yours  i really don t have respect for and will voice that In rehab we are told everyone disability is different Some people had health issues before paralysis Im not going to be interrogated about my medical history The funniest is part is my inboc People saying  Im sorry for how they are being in the thread   or  this place used to build people up and try to help but lately the people are bitter    I always want to double check myself and Mr Mrs in what way did I lash out at someone I did say snarky things when being told i shouldn t need help but thats all Sorry for the wall of text but usually when someone is trying to help you they help you The original post stated my situation and asked for possible ways to change it When responded with  given your levels you should be able to do this or that   Thats the only  lashing out I did  aside from  but you are not even that much paralyzed tho   comments and messages Everyones case are different I don t discuss issues i have other than SCI Why i am stuck in bed so long has nothing to do with what i said asked People don t have to  understand  something if they have all the info they need already I agree with the PM people this place has changed I don t have the ability or choice to just move I wish i could I would still need help daily if I did This is more than just getting in my wheelchair and living life Well I apologize that my injury is less significant than yours and that I need assistance with things I am assuming besides paraplegia you have no other life altering health issues going on Cervical Cord Injury Asia grade CSorry to break it to u but it s quite likely that the nerve damage you have right now is going to stay Most of improvement will be seen in the first 6 months or so  About driving I have a weak left leg and no power in my feet but I can drive an automatic just fine I ve got full hand function though You have to check and probably do a driving test with the government entity that gives out drivers licences where you live These kinds of things are common and shouldn t take too much time Good to discuss with your doctor in any case  Congrats it sounds like you ve made some great progress   My partner has a much lower injury and he s working very hard with walking and physical therapy   but we know he may never be able to do things like jump or run again He can t lift his feet properly You can try your best stay strong keep moving but don t expect too much too soon Just be in the moment as much as possible and be thankful for what you have If it comes it comes  90  of Americans these days drive automatic if it makes you feel better Don t be afraid to talk to somebody about depression one year after can be darker than the first I d get a driving assessment there might be ways to make it easier or safer for you Ask at your rehab hospital about it   Unfortunately you are past the period of most neuro recovery but you re doing all the right things Keep up the exercise and if you can work with a neurorehab physiotherapist it could help i ve met s few incomplete SCI folks who ve had good results from Bobath method physio  I ll talk to the doctor I mean due to all the implants 3  in my forearms maybe restricting the movements  He says it d be okay to expect upto 10  more grip after removing them  Not a 100   but still   Thank you for your time Thank you for your kind words Thanks I ll talk to my physio about bobath method  I hadn t heard about that They ve put the implants in my left forearms Is it possible that they are restricting movement and maybe after having them removed there are chances of improvement in hand grip Does a Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulator work There s a conversation about this on the CRPS sub Might want to type this into your search bar and take a look  College QuestionI m an incomplete quad in college I m a junior this year In terms of practical advice get to know professors asap Professors are usually happy to help when you need it but you have to ask I m also hard of hearing and I ve had professors give me their whole lectures again during office hours because I couldn t hear them in class And talk to your school s disability resource center about all of your options I have flexible attendance excused lates computer in class note takers and audio recording and testing accommodations Plus since my professors know me they re more willing to informally accommodate me  within reason  I have a prof who gave me flexible due dates and alternative assignments If necessary you c an ask for classes to be moved to more accessible rooms and when accessibility on campus is lacking you can get that fixed Just ask   When I was a freshman I had basically no friends and it was a bummer Now I have a bunch of really close friends It s good for all of the normal social stuff and it s good because they re always happy to help me when I need it I taught them how to take apart my manual chair for when we go out some of them know how to lift me and they do other small things from time to time And in return I give them the better parking spots and better seats at shows All of my closest friends are able bodied so I joined the SCI discord as well It s nice to talk to people who understand what it s like and what I m talking about  It all depends on your level and injury  I plan on going back since my recent injury but my biggest take away from mui first year of college is don t be lazy I fucked around to much with my newly found independence ended up smoking and drinking myself into failing all my classes Don t do that  How independent are you Can you drive Do you do your own care  Make sure to get in touch with your campus disability office  They not only help you with class accommodations but may also have info on disability clubs meetings and events   Your question is pretty broad do you have specific areas you are concerned about  Do you have a good plan for taking notes  Like a human scribe to help Or maybe record the lecture in OneNote Ask your disability office whats available Good luck  Hey regarding the education side you first need to contact the student disability center and have your accomodations for everything you will need in order so you have a lot less to worry about with classes That was super hard for me to get used to go to class in a wheelchair as I got my injury while in college  on winter break  Using the school buses sucked especially in the winter Its hard for people like us to get around a big campus But tbh buses sure beat wheeling my ass around campus in the snow    Also outside of the education part best thing you can do is go out and meet people and not let the loneliness overwhelm you I fortunately already had a few friends in college so that helped a little but I couldnt do a lot of the things I usually did with them They helped me a lot when going to parties bars  which my college had a lot of lol   But honestly just try to enjoy yourself as best as you can Try to make friends this will help a Iot I was actually able to join a fraternity when I was in my wheelchair which was pretty cool that they let me in and were so accepting But most important thing if you live in a dorm apt by yourself is go out and meet people whether it be people on your floor or in your class Loneliness can be killer  Do you live in the dorms or off campus  Thank you so much for the information Having no friends freshman year is actually something I m nervous about as well For me it s better to have my own room because of my disability so I m missing out on the whole roommate first friend deal Sorry   my injury is C5 incompleteI ll definitely keep that in mind thanks I can t drive but I m doing most of my care The only thing I need help with and am having someone come in for is using a piece of my therapy equipment and stretching Thank you for the info I mostly wanted any advice you guys could give I guess I m mostly nervous about making friends Because of my injury it s better for me to have a room to myself so I m missing out on the whole roommate first friend deal Thanks I ll need it lol I have a few plans I have a LiveScribe Pen and my disability office will provide notes for free which is nice Thank you so much for the information It s super helpful I live in a dorm by myselfdoes anyone get paresthesia or neuropathic pains from taking a shower Cold water will sting below my injury but it s manageable   deleted  Itching is a common but often overlooked symptom of neuropathy   Allodynia  where normally non threatening stimuli are perceived as painful  and hyperalgesia  normally threatening stimuli are perceived as more painful  are features of neuropathy which may account for pain after exposure to a hot or cold stimulus like a shower  T2 T9 I have Allydonia all over my back and legs Cold definitely makes it worse  Yeah that s the thing I hate most about using The shower chair is not being able to turn around and keep everything warm I m a very incomplete injury so I have a good bit of movement and sensation but still struggle a lot with neuropathy especially after my neurosurgery 5 weeks ago It s gotten worse since surgery for me   I d never considered it being the cold I get these itchy sensations when I ve been standing for too long as well Same with walking or needing to shift my body weight My body is trying to tell me to find a seat ASAP or to do something different at that time It s only recently that I ve noticed I get the same feeling while in the shower and right after the shower But I ve had that feeling for awhile too So I m not sure if it s an overstimulation issue or what I do try to keep my body warm the whole time through my shower Yes This happens when I ve been pressing up against something and not feel it or don t move around enough move too much too Thank you for the medical names I ll look into this when I have have time Just got diagnosed with arachnoiditis Please talk to meI was diagnosed with Adhesive Arachnoiditis in February 2019 but based on when my symptoms started and my stage it s likely I ve had it 10  years  I m 28  Like you it s in my cauda equina and I ve got the same symptoms but a bit worse   First thing s first  read up on Dr Tennant s work and get yourself on ALA PEA and curcumin supplements ASAP You can get them over the counter I take 1200mg PEA  600 mg twice daily  600mg ALA and a high potency turmeric curcumin with bioperine from black pepper daily   There are pharmaceutical options  NSAIDs corticosteroids lyrica neurontin etc  but see where you re at after you meet with the neurologist Basically you re going to want to throw as many anti inflammatory neuroprotective neuro regenerative and pain management options aids at this thing as you can handle   Complete and utter paralysis is NOT the usual outcome of this disease although every patient is unique Sometimes symptoms come and go Sometimes you improve decline improve etc   For me overall I m better than where I was in February   The important thing is to keep moving and stretch at least three times a day Some people find TENS units or heat ice helpful It s important to do whatever physical exercise you can that is easy on your back  swim use a recumbent bike walk  Also be careful when bending or lifting Whatever you do fight like hell to avoid sitting laying down in bed all the time   Also please get yourself into good therapy It is totally normal to be terrified grieving and frustrated or heartbroken while navigating your new reality  Check out Dr Forest Tennant s PDF book on this  Also there are some FB groups on adhesive Arachnoiditis that can offer some support and practical info I m NAD but I do think it is progressive but there s no set progression speed if that makes sense I d say that it s great that you are as active as you are right now with the occasional symptoms and pain that s not debilitating Keep living your life as you do now as it sounds like from what I read in your question that it s overall manageable right now Good luck   Edited to be more specific about what to look up on above doc His pain clinic got closed so there s a lot of stuff about that on the tubes also  I was diagnosed with adhesive arachnoiditis in March of this year There s a fantastic Facebook group called ARACHNOIDITIS  and it is typed out and all capital letters   There are a few thousand folks in this group with amazing stories protocols and advice  Hey thanks for replying What is ALA Google is giving me a couple similar but different supplements   Do you know what caused your arachnoiditis I haven t had any surgery or major trauma I ve fallen on my tailbone pretty hard but i was fine I moved a washer and dryer with 1 other person and that was hard lifting but it didn t cause any pain at the time   Another thing i can think of is the epidural i had 7 years ago in labor It seemed weirdly painful going in and i couldn t walk for like a day but i thought that was normal and nobody at the hospital said anything about my need to be wheeled around while I was there The feeling in my legs came back before it was time to leave I still don t know whether that s normal but that s the only invasive thing that s ever been done to my back I ve always found it hard to stand still for more than a few minutes but the rectal pain only started a few months ago and was the reason for my MRI that found my nerves were clumped Dating Advise for people with a SCINew type of catheter in trialsSomeone linked me the trial    https   www spinalsingularity com connected catheter clinical study  Hello everyone  I founded Spinal Singularity a few years ago to build this product and try to offer an alternative to Intermittent and Foley catheters  I was sick of using disposable catheters every day and also didn t want a Foley  I thought it would be cool if there was a device that allowed you to empty your bladder with the push of a button    We have conducted two clinical studies on the device and are in the middle of our third study  This study will get us the data we need to get the product cleared for use by the FDA    With this product we tried to leverage the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of intermittent foley catheters    1 Our product lasts for up to 7 days in the body so you only would have to insert one instead of   50 disposable catheters each week   2 It is fully internal to the body so it doesn t hang out like a Foley which we hope will improve clinical outcomes like UTI   3 It is non surgical and can be inserted or removed by a user very quickly and easily  So if it doesn t work or you prefer to go back to your old catheters then you can do so at any time    If you know anyone who is interested in learning more please feel free to refer them to me and also to our websites below  We have clinical sites all across the US and are actively looking for new patients to support our study  Thanks     www connectedcatheter com  https   www connectedcatheter com    www spinalsingularity com  https   www spinalsingularity com     https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04059159  https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04059159  This is new but it s been around My urologist told me about it but I used a foley too long and eroded my urethra for it to be an option   Essentially you just press an internal button somewhere in you and it lets you pee if memory serves me right  I have never heard of that but it sounds pretty nice  Why not just go with the in and out catheter  I actually did the first consultation but they said I had a stricture in my urethra or something So I d have to get taken care of first  When can this possibly come out I m basically constantly getting UTI s and it s an absolute nightmare Tired of feeling sick all the time  If this works as you say it sounds like an absolute game changer And I d be ecstatic about it Out of curiosity how long did you use an indwelling catheter and how did you know it eroded Our device may not be for everyone but I was sick of using 8 10 catheters every day  With this device it could replace up to a week s worth of catheters    50   We are also hopeful that we can improve clinical outcomes like UTI On 08 19 18 I had my accident My wife gave me this yesterday  One year ago today I almost lost you You got a second

rehab with someone that progressed like you It was miraculous and he was a tremendous inspiration It looks like you had a tremendous rehab team and a huge amount of support I really enjoyed watching

exaggeration the most beautiful video I have ever seen on Reddit   Really  This will be an happy inspiration for me for a long time I think   I went to this subreddit to understand more about spinal cords injuries and the people behind it because I m Studying physiotherapy now and spinal cord injuries are the topic we re on now   But man I m so happy for your progress A tremendous amount of courage willpower and perseverance you have there And truly a second chance at life I wish you the best in life  Congrats dude So amazing  Way to go dude  damn dude congrats you re doing great and i

needed to read that As inspiring and tear Jerking as ops post is I often find my self sad maybe jealous even of some people s recovery Need reminding at times that I shouldn t compare my injury to the next person And of course I m happy for him So well put  from the father of a C4 incomplete Sounds like you were overwhelmed with a variety of emotions probably some of them in conflict with others of them I m going to challenge you to talk to someone who you know loves you about how this video made you feel Talking it out loud with a trusted person can be a good step toward developing a more comfortable  and self caring  internal life  I hope you can hear this in the spirit in which it is offered Please think about it Hey there I have an incomplete congenital defect with mass effect that I had surgery on about 5 weeks ago Mine is at L4 S5    Just wanted to say hello to another low injury level fellow     Surgery made my left leg a little worse and my nerve pain and stamina is definitely worse than before I too am hoping for a recovery But Only time can tell since nerves are tricky buggers Thanks so much I really appreciate it I m going to post some new videos soon of some more progress Keep a look out for them  Hi Moby I live in LA now where the accident happened I had a food truck but now we are opening a brick and mortar in Downtown Culver City I m still able to cook but I won t be cooking on the line more prepping making sauces and expediting during dinner service I haven t been able to really practice how a real dinner service will go to see where my energy level will be at which is my biggest concern but I m gonna have to suck it up I m really scared I won t be able to hang to be quite honest it s really physical and fast in a restaurant and my mobility is very limited but when I was in ICU one of my nurses told me something that really stuck with me that I ve been telling myself since  impossible goals  and then I just tell myself  don t be a pussy just do it  Wish me luck Popping sensation in feet This condition is what they call Neuropathic Pain It happened because of the injured nerve around the spinal cord It is a regular thing for a person with complete injury Go and try discuss this with your Doctor They might prescribe you with Gabapentin or Pregabalin It usually helps a lot with the discomfort and pain  I have an injury at your level also complete I have something that resembles your sensation I call it  fluttering  in my feet It happens a few times a day but thankfully does not cause pain or annoyance I take pregabalin 70mg 3 times a day that keeps the neuropain away  Never heard NP described this way before You may also have some incomplete sensation returning which isn t always a good thing because of neuropathic pain Same advice as above Quadriplegic   Cripple on the floor Vlog Song by Lauren Daigle   You Say 4 Days Away From Being 4 Years Out On My InjuryReminiscing about my struggles and victories over the last 4 years got me thinking If you asked me at the time of my injury if I ever thought I d hike Acadia National Park return to hunting lift weights or become better at golf than I was before my injury I would have said hell no Now 1456 days later I have accomplished all those things plus much more   Life really is crazy  Congrats man Love seeing positive SCI recovery stories I m five months out of mine and keeping my hope alive   If you don t mind me asking what was the cause of injury  Congratulations man Hearing SCI recovery stories feels so good I m 4 years post my injury yet to see any significant improvement towards moving even my toe I work now Hoping to at least be able to stand on my own Hope something remarkable happens in the medical world to help me in achieving my dream  Amazing Keep it up  Thanks bud I broke 6 7 cervical vertebrae body surfing If you ever need someone to talk to don t hesitate to reach out Keep hammering and stay strong Thanks Definitely got lucky with my injury in that my cord wasn t severed but it was damaged They re doing some crazy things with stem cells and I am constantly watching for advancements there to help me avoid another fusion someday   If you don t mind how did your injury happen Dealing with nerve painResearch Lyrica  pregabalin  Side effects can be a little intolerable in my experience   Neurontin  gabapentin  Drowsiness is an easy trade off for symptoms Yeah no narcs if at all possible I find them less effective on my neuralgia than gabapentin   Sleep well  I have had similar issues with my elbows and shoulders I tried one of those copper sleeves for my elbows The  copper  part is quackery but the slight compression helped I don t take Percocet like I used to and have noticed that it also made it hard to sleep at night I ve tried gabapentin but made me tired all day long I ve been taking remeron since my accident which is for depression and sleep but I noticed it helped with the pins and needles feeling in my hands So take my advise with a grain of salt Everyone is different but the sleeve and a heat pack usually allows me to fall asleep and get me through to the next day  Weird  I actually updated my post a couple days ago on your original question about your arm  when I suggested you might have a syrinx  asking about how it was going and if your arm issues had gotten better I m glad you figured out what it was but sorry you have nerve pain I take Cymbalta and it is supposed to work on nerve pain It s also an antidepressant It doesn t make me drowsy or anything and actually works quite well for pain or at least I find it does The only times I have ever taken Percocet they have just made me sleepy and not done anything for pain  Topomax  topirimate  has worked great for my nerve pain  u aabbcc28 the comments Thanks I didn t see any notification on that post Apparently it was a really large syrinx going from my injury at t6 up into my neck The surgeon said it really squirted out when he inserted the tube I might have to look into cymbalta but I m already on an antidepressant Homebuilding plans tips for life in a wheelchair I spent the last several months looking for a place to buy and I will tell you what I looked for and plan to do   Ramps are important most places have small steps that abled body people don t notice but it s a pain for some in a wheelchair to get over every day   Carpet is a pain in the ass to roll on stick with hard wood or concrete   Bathroom doors are never wide enough and usually the bathroom as a whole is to cramped   Walk in showers without doors are great   https   www amazon com dp B0009EP2S2 ref cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_kMnxDb6WHH1MY      is expensive but great in kitchens  I will gladly take a few of these if someone would buy them for me     Front load washer and dryer not stacked and on a pedestal much easier to use   Smaller handheld vacuums like the battery powered Dyson are much easier to use I also plan on getting a Roomba because I m lazy like that   I also decided to get a lot of home automation stuff because it makes things much easier Example  Google home or Alexa smart light bulbs or switches ring doorbell smart deadbolt   Other than that I just think little adaptive equipment here and there   Edit addition  fridge with a bottom freezer and water filter within reach is super helpful to  Have just been through this process for my 12 y o daughter 2 years post accident T9 complete We had a lot of help through a major remodelling project Everything that u knockout350 said is right on the money for us too  Here are some of the things I probably wouldn t have thought about   Have a sink near the stove   or at least on the same run of countertop   in the kitchen You ll need a way to drain a heavy pot  of pasta say  without having to lift it up and turn round   Bathroom doors and turning space in front of beside the toilets for transfers Pocket doors are great if you have the space and the construction type to make them work   If you have stairs put a stairgate across the top My daughter was almost as worried as I was at the prospect of her tumbling down to the basement if she overcooked the corner coming out of the kitchen   Storage in bathrooms  for catheter supplies etc  that are reachable when sitting on the can We went for sturdy cabinets with drawers that also act as a solid platform for transfer assistance  daughter didn t want grab bars everywhere if we could avoid it    Consider lowering countertop height in the kitchen  depending on your cousin s husband s height and wingspan But don t forget the able bodied people in the household too   don t want to give them backache from bending over to do the dishes We ended up with a split level arrangement   Wheel under sinks are great Don t forget a bit of wheel under prep space as well and possibly a separate cooktop with wheelunder access as well if you have space But that means you ve got to be really clever about accessible storage you don t want to get rid of all the lower cabinets in the kitchen  cause then there s nowhere to put anything within reach   Speaking of which bending forward and sideways to reach into a cabinet can be difficult so consider deep drawers or cabinets with fully extending pull out shelves You can also get drop down systems for uppers too although I have no direct experience of those as we didn t go that route   Home automation is a huge thing Whereas I can just hop out of bed if I ve forgotten to turn the overhead light off it s a laborious challenge for somebody with an SCI Just asking Google or Alexa to turn the light off is way easier Same for blinds on the windows   The Ring doorbell is great too In our case  we have a dog who isn t very good at not running away  we didn t want a remote opener but even the opportunity to talk to whoever s at the door to say  yes I m here I m coming but it ll take me a while to get to you  is very helpful   If they re designing a home to build and it s not going to be all on one level put an elevator in right at the design stage rather than trying to retrofit it later     x200B   I m a newbie at all this  both at Reddit and at being the parent of a child with an SCI  so I hope at least some of that is sensible helpful  To add to u knockout350 sinks you can roll under You can get them in kitchen and bath models   Grab bars by toilet   I am sending you a PM with a link to some videos about this  I d attach them here but not sure that s allowed   Thank you so much Would never have thought about things like the fridge and washer and dryer This is fantastic I m sorry for your daughter s accident but you sound like an awesome parent renovating your home so your daughter doesn t feel limited All the best for you and her   Edit  Said  father  as default because that s what I am Changed to  parent  Thank you Been going through hell You might want to post again I think this got buried  I m sorry you re going through this  Today I went back to the place where I became paralyzed I hadn t been since my accident I hope this inspires you that despite what happens to you in life there isn t anything that you can t achieve Does anyone exceed 80mg on their daily baclofen Yeah 160mg day plus 32mg tizanadine just to get a handle on my spasticity  I was at 90mg for a few years and I can say it s not great I was literally tired all the time Sluggish and the meds weren t even working that well at that point I also rushed my titration before getting my pump and that withdrawal SUCKED if that s what the withdrawal was like I couldn t imagine what it was doing to me long term If you re at the point you re above 80mg q day you really should consider a pump My dose per day is way way way smaller now and it s 1000  more effective  I was on 40mg three times daily but it didn t have any more effect than my 20mg three times daily did The only side effects I noticed were the standard ones of sleepiness but got me it wasn t any worse than the regular doses I m on 80 officially but down to 50 now and intend to get to 40 I think the higher dose helps my spasticity a bit but I feel better in my head on less  I m on 120 MG baclofen don t help me at all valium does the trick for me but I need to be aware and alert during the day for school my spasm have gotten so bad that I end up getting a ulcer on my leg From the friction between my bed and my leg Holy shit I was on 60 mg day and I was a wreck I was super foggy sleepy and uncoordinated I skipped school the whole time I was on that dose because I couldn t stay awake Granted I m a pretty small guy but I still can t imagine being on more than 80 mg day If the doctor is comfortable with it then it could be worth trying though  I was taking 80mg of baclofen and 32 mg of zanaflex everyday for my spasticity Wasn t enough so I got the baclofen pump Love it No side effects and I stopped all the meds C1 quadriplegic here and I can recommend just start weaning off of it You don t need it trust me I have been off of it now for I would say more than 3 years also I cut out gabapentin if you re on that as well Jesus Christ Holy moly  My one doctor gets freaked out because my neurologist gave me a whole 12mg of tizanidine on top of 60mg of baclofen  I hope you don t mind if I tell him about you Lol I hope your spasticity is better God it s terrible to live with Have you been okay taking that much Any side effects He was supposed to be getting a trial before getting a pump installed Last week he fell though and refractured his c3 that was fused last year and

older we get the more our vision deteriorates or worsens I d go with an 18 inch tablet  I m a C6 7 Quadriplegic and I m a huge advocate for Samsung I ve worked at best buy for about 5 years and saw when the Samsung view came out I thought it was neat but boy it will be a pain to find a bedside mount for it It has an integrated stand which would work on a table or desk I guess you could put it on a rollaway bed table With that being said the new iPad features and being able to find accessories  bed mount  I would recommend going that route instead  I love my Samsung products but I can somewhat use my hands and I am totally bias towards Android mainly due to price and value  I would approach your situation as an honest salesman and make the best recommendation I would full heartedly recommend the iPad pro due to the already available accessibility features versus relying on apps and workarounds The 5  difference in screen size is big but not when it is going to be used right in bed   I remember my family was trying to find similar accommodations when I was injured in 2011 It was a completely different world in technology and it has come so far since then  I commend you for making her situation more comfortable and feel free to reach out to me I will do my best to respond promptly but I m kinda dealing with some PTSD and anxiety at the moment  Go big We mounted a smaller tablet on a swing arm attached to a stand with wheels It was ok but not great especially for surfing or reading Then for a bigger screen  we put a laptop on a wheeled hospital cart and made a custom stand with pvc plywood and bungees so we could angle it more Works great   Don t forget to get a small Bluetooth speaker like the  40 kind they sell at Costco We use Audible Netflix and Amazon on the tablet Or if the room is noisy get a lightweight headset with a microphone for the voice commands If she gets the hang of it she might be willing to do more than just read   The latest Amazon fire TV works pretty well with voice commands We can watch Netflix Hulu etc all with voice commands on the TV It isn t perfect but it s pretty good Not a book reader of course but we appreciate using the big TV screen too  Does anyone go to music festivals or travel a lot I have not been to Burning Man  I m a paraplegic using a chair full time  but here are some source that touch on accessibility at BM Whether they re helpful to you or not I m not sure but here you go   https   www latimes com travel la tr travel all systems go visiting burning man with a disability 20190708 story html  https   www mobilitycamp org   https   www newmobility com 2013 01 the magic of burning man   It seems like the second to last link has the most helpful resources I wish you luck  I go to coachella every year and they re really accommodating My group camps and they have an ADA section right by the festival entrance They also have elevated viewing platforms but they only allow one guest with you I ve found ways around it though I would recommend some knobby tires to be able to push out on the grass Burning man is on my list so i ll make it out there eventually A lot of prep goes into festivals but it s always a good time and people are more than willing to help  I would definitely look into renting an RV with your own bathroom I personally can not stand port a potties especially when it s hot Plus I watched some youtube videos and able bodied people are encouraged to squat on the Port o potty seat not sit so there s that as well Maybe if you do use a tent use a portable commode I used to have one in my full size van it was a lifesaver You d have to line it and empty it but it s a cheaper option than renting an RV Good luck and let us know what you decide on and how it was  I know a few folks with SCI who have gone to BM Burning man allows disabled folks to use a vehicle on the playa and nobody else is allowed to  bikes and art cars only  so you can get around and you ll be popular with others who are eager to hitch a ride with you Most people come with a  camp  of people who all plan together so you can work with your camp to plan what you need Renting an RV for BM has been a bit of a challenge   you will he asked when you rent and they may refuse you because of the state of the vehicles when they are returned from BM   I d google for pics and info of disabled Burners we all know burners are not shy about sharing their experiences from the Playa Here s one camp trying to encourage other Burners to be more accessible  https   www mobilitycamp org  page_id 61  Re  Festivals  Another friend of mine is low quad and uses a manual chair and goes to festivals all the time She just camps in a tent using a camp cot Most large festivals have disabled tent areas closest to the port a potties   Another wheelchair users guide to festivals www vice com amp en_ca article rmjvea wheelchair festival guide I went to Afrikaburn this year a regional burn Have been to many festivals before Was actually quite accessible the desert is mostly rock I was just sleeping in a tent with a good mattress but I ve got a low SCI and can do ground transfers easily  If you want to go to a festivals it s usually a good idea to talk to the organisation Have gotten free tickets campsite next to toilets special access etc  At AB they had a lot of accessible toilets with a number lock Unfortunately no accessible showers but when I got in touch with the org they told me about other options There was another guy in a wheelchair who wanted to make an accessible camp with showers etc but that didn t happen in the end BM is a lot bigger so they might have something like that At AB I saw 3 others with wheelchairs so if you go you won t be the only one  I m a 4 yr BM veteran and have c2 c6 SCI RVs are expensive  They do not allow disabled people a car that is false  exception for build camps needing a truck for build  Maybe a motorized wheelchair would be best looking into making an art car golf cart for next year for myself I biked last year and hurt myself  I personally don t support RVs for BM and it is 100  NOT A FESTIVAL  It is hot dusty cold windy  it s hard I stay in a hexayurt with a thick futon mattress raised slightly on wooden pallets and tons of padding  The ground is hard enough for wheelchairs no hills but once that dust is no longer compacted from people cars it is hard to be mobile in a chair I had a camp mate that was wheelchair bound and heavily relied on rides but was honestly stuck at camp a bunch which they never really complained about  But they did express FOMO  fear of missing out  and decided that year was their last burn  Maybe stick to Coachella I would add a free wheel to go with the knobby tires makes pushing around on grass gravel etc so much easier Yeah I don t think there is any way in hell I could do bowel program in a porta potty but finding a wheelchair accessible rv looks to be really difficult Thanks that was a good read I just don t know how comfortable I am with trying to tent campHas anyone here fallen and reinjured their previous sci I m sorry I don t have an answer for you  I will keep your father and you in my prayers   One of my greatest fears is refracturing As I broke my back from slipping on a simple dock I ve fallen on a pool deck about 6 times since and passed out cold with no refractures If any of you have tips for bone strengthening I m all ears  Any guitarists out there I m wondering how to solve the problem of not being able to use a foot pedal anymore Not a guitar player but I did some quick research via the Google and the YouTubes and eventually found a similar Reddit thread with some responses  not sure if it ll help much if at all but figured I d share it   https   www reddit com r Guitar comments 2qrbm6 paraplegic_guitarist_here_could_use_some_help  utm_source share utm_medium ios_app  I hope you find something that would work I did ask my husband who is a guitar player and the only thing he could come up with was getting the right software and using eye tracking technology to changes tones n such  I have no idea what I m talking about when it comes to guitars so excuse my ignorance    If you can t seem to figure it out but are part of the music scene wherever you live or could become part of it maybe bring the dilemma up there and get a bunch of people brainstorming Good luck  Hi T10 complete para here I had the same problem    I got round it originally by using a Pigtronix Keymaster This has an expression out where you can blend between the two loops I made a momentary micro switch that plugs into the expression out and taped it to the bottom horn of my guitar I have my guitar strap adjusted so that when I lean forward slightly it drops the guitar onto my leg and engages the switch so I can go from one loop to the other pretty much on the beat Recently JHS have brought out the Switchback which is amongst other things an A B looper The good thing is it has a jack for a remote foot switch so again I made a micro switch and can switch between two loops   The Keymaster isn t made anymore and is fairly expensive it does have a lot of other features though The Switchback isn t cheap for what it is but it s a compact solution I m very happy with it   I have my effects on a board on a keyboard stand next to me so I can twiddle knobs and also engage pedals manually when I need to change the sound in each loop   I m planning on mounting the switch on some of my guitars permanently and having a jack near the main jack to make it easier to switch instruments Currently I run the lead for the micro switch along my guitar cable and gaffer tape it to the body   Hope this helps   You ve already got some great suggestions just thought I d add my off the cuff thought  I sew and sewing machines use foot pedals  I work around this by putting the pedal underneath my elbow which leaves my hands free to work the cloth through the machine  Maybe you could try putting it on your shoulder somehow so you could work it with your chin  For a low tech fix I d say just put the pedals on a little table next to you and give them a quick slap instead of a stomp With enough practice I m sure you could do it pretty quickly My colleague is a great blues guitarist he just has an effects machine that has all the usual effects you d find on a pedal but on a tabletop box he just puts on on a chair next to his music Not as easy as having an extra limb to do it while you re playing but you figure out how make it work with your hands With an electric guitar you could look at having it added to your guitar as a switch too though no  Just try to put your foot on the petal and get a spasm going that has some rhythm  Holy crap what an informative and insightful response I really appreciate it thank you I m going to school this fall for computer science so maybe that eye tracking thing could be a future project that s awesome   I should have done the googling myself but this was the first place I thought to ask   Anyways thank you again And tell your husband cheers for the suggestion Wow dude thank you so much for the explanation The thought of putting a switch on the bottom of my guitar and pressing it on my thigh had never occurred to me That s a great idea I m so glad I made this thread so many great suggestions   Again thank you You gave me a lot to work with I was thinking of something along the same lines Chin or mouth operated   Or if you attached a switch to the base  body area of the guitar you could press it with your strumming hand or inside elbow Need help Is it possible for a quadriplegic to turn the page of a magazine on a tablet w  voice control or similar This is what I use but I don t know

hopefully others will chime in with their own but based on conversations with others and a conversation I had yesterday with my own doctor it s a great option for some people and often the only thing they can find that helps Your spasms spasticity sound pretty severe If the oral baclofen isn t working and neither are any of the other medication options I would consider it The baclofen is much more effective when it s administered intrathecally and you can essentially work to find the right dosage for you  high enough that your symptoms are manageable but not so high that you lose all muscle tone   unless that s what you re going for of course    From what I understand they do a trial first to make sure it will actually work before they implant the pump so you don t have to immediately commit to the whole thing until you know whether it will work or not   Sorry I can t be more helpful I m really hoping others with personal experience jump in  Best decision I have made since my injury I was as bad as you with spacticity and it was a complete 180 after I got it All I can say is DO IT You will not regret it  It s a game changer   1 Oral baclofen makes you super drowsy and even after the adjustment period it s like living on Benadryl Once you try the pump you ll be amazed how much more energy you have   2 Don t have to carry around and remember to take your medicine You carry a roughly 4 6 month reserve inside the pump   3 Never have to worry about baclofen withdrawals If you ve never had one you don t want one  The spasms are terrible and it s like having Parkinson s  I have one I was at 90mg daily oral baclofen when I got the pump Best decision I ve made It s substantially better for my everyday life    Also come to the discord There s a few of us that have the pump    https   discord gg 4RqZTM I ve seen this as a game changer for many people but also met other people who find they still have spasms afterwards To echo someone else they do do a test first so perhaps try that Otherwise try dantrolene as others have said it helped me Although I do take 70 mg of baclofen per day And currently reducing from 80 mg and I will try to get to 40 mg a day if possible Although I don t feel this drowsiness or tiredness and have no problem to stay up 16 hours a day with seven hours sleep I want to experiment to see if less baclofen makes any difference to my cognitive ability   I work full time  I also am an incomplete c3   c4 but with no real motor function other than a real damn good shoulder shrug I was also crazy spastic before I went through with getting the pump I refill mine twice a year and when I look back on it I would go through with it again rather than taking a bunch of pills a day I also smoke a decent amount of cannabis that has helped me along the way  I used to get spasms bad too they turned me into a 2x4 and I d end up on the floor I tried the oral baclofen but it put me to sleep ended up getting the pump and it s been the fuckin best thing I ve done it don t knock me out and controls spasms once you find your sweet spot for dosage you re golden I don t have a spinal cord injury but I do have neurological issues and spasticity due to a condition going undiagnosed for too long and it effected my brain and spine I have three medications in my pump currently and it has made things so much better I don t have most of my stomach or intestines so the oral meds I do take don t work very well I have baclofen and a numbing agent in the pump along with a pain med I ve had good and bad experiences and can answer just about any question Feel free to ask away  This may sound ridiculous but get off of the medicine and go see a chiropractor I got off of it and off of gabapentin and I am a C1 complete Yes when every single motion and movement is a literal fight with your own body spasticity can definitely make you feel like going crazy The usual  at least it helps you maintain muscle mass  isn t much of a comfort either Haha   I ve tried valium  Oxazepam  and it has some effect Unfortunately it also makes me fall asleep so it isn t exactly an option if I also need to function Never heard of dantrolene but I ll investigate it   Thanks for your input I second this but I have to get a refill every 2 3 months Just depends on how well it affects you It s odd at first having a tiny hockey puck in you I ve had mine replaced once so far due to my first one just needing a new battery My body didn t even know the switch The pump has been a huge blessing for me I still get spasms but nowhere near as bad I could have my doctor increase the dose but having a little tone can help with my transfers When I m totally loose it s kinda difficult to maintain balance Could a UTI cause full bladder sensations I m pretty similar to you c5 incomplete with sensation so I cath whenever I m full What your describing is UTI symptoms I get When I feel full and cath with little to nothing coming out it s usually my bladder spasms due to an infection So my opinion I recommend you get your urine checked ASAP  Sounds like a UTI to me Best thing to do now is drink lots of water or at least clear fluids Cut down the sugar as this gives the bugs fuel Spina bifida here   I ve been able to detect them before it gets too bad cloudy and a stronger smell means I m pumping fluid to flush it out   Good luck Be prepared to perform a UA for your doctor or bring a urine sample to your visit  Good luck  You might also want to check if you have any other symptoms like fever chills or spasms Since you ve not written about it I am assuming you don t have them   C5 C6 Quad here At times i wont have any other symptoms like fever chills and spasms Sometimes I have had the bladder full feeling but it just stayed that way for a day and got normal next So since this is persisting even after a day it s mostly an infection    I guess with an SCI It s very important to be aware of all signs your body is giving any symptoms and listen to your body  Get well soon buddy  Not a c but a t12 I have sensation of when I have to go and like you I cath when I feel the need My urologist also recommends if I don t feel the need cath at 6 hour just in case   I just got home from being admitted for UTI and had the same thing happen I felt like I was cathing more often throughout the day thinking I was full and ignored it till I had some spasms when I was cathing and then leaking a little after which should have been a red flag but didn t end up going to hospital until I had a 101 8 fever  If you are ever in doughy just go to doctors   Sorry if it s bad format in mobile  Follow up  as of yesterday  at the doctor  confirmed as a UTI She gave me thumbs up for flushing and also suggested  in future  unsweetened cranberry juice Apparently there  really  is something about cranberries not just the acidity which helps kill off UTI bacteria   Thanks again to EVERYONE here who provided feedback  Thanks That was the main suspicion that had started to form when I first noticed it I ll get in touch with my primary on Monday and hopefully will be able to have them process things By the way   thank you thank you thank YOU The iced tea flush seems to have helped tremendously I woke up overnight but at closer to 2 5 hr intervals and it was with an actual full bladder It seems I m closer to normal now I ll still give my doctor a call tomorrow to see about at least doing a specimen but it s definitely better Thanks also That makes a lot of sense I hadn t been paying  enough  attention to scent but that seems to support the theory   For some reason I hadn t thought in terms of flushing things out but that makes a lot of  short term  sense at the very least Since my main beverage of choice is home brewed unsweetened iced tea I certainly don t have any trouble with just upping my intake Heck might even break out the black currant mix to let it do its thing Waking up every couple of hours with a legitimately full bladder is certainly better than every hour and the phantom sensation of one Yep I have a couple of spare specimen cups at home  still sealed  because it s easier to generate them at home instead of trying to do so at a lab or urologist s office as part of my usual pre visit check Thanks so much I ve had a couple of odd overnight chills  odd since I usually sleep with a fan blowing even during winter  but those passed quickly As for spasms just the  usual  ones that I ve had even back in rehab  One of these days my feet won t feel like they re knotted muscles and I will have found bliss    Yeah I m pretty much in the  of course it s an infection and why didn t you go to the doctor on Friday idiot   camp  For the record that was me calling myself an idiot so no worries about any rule breaking  For me it s in the 4  hour range not including overnight when sleep is fine   And I am mentally kicking myself more than a bit for not going o the doctor on Friday

after irrigating bladder  Questions on blast  sorry   Still having pain Making urine Is urine clear Any other pain anywhere else Are bowels regular  How soon after pain did CT occur Was it regular CT or CT urogram  I don t think I have ever known someone who does this Can you explain the procedure  Have you ruled out stones Cause massive pain for me  No problem The excruciating pain has subsided but I do have some leftover irritation and pain which comes and goes But not as intense as Saturday My urine looks clear and healthy not smelly I do have a lot of tension in my lower back but I think it s due to using a new wheelchair due to my wits are being repaired at the moment  my bowels are regular I go every single day I m not sure about the CT scan because they gave me two doses of morphine which to not even touch my pain so then they gave me Ativan and I knocked out I believe it was a regular CT scan Do you mean irrigating It s to inject saline solution to cleanse the bladder and then drain it out since I had a mitrofanoff valve installed I produce a lot of mucus because they used a piece of my intestines to create a channel to catheterize through around my belly button area Questions regarding personal careI do intermittent self catheterization as well I m a lady so I use coloplast speedicath compact set with a bag I believe they have a male version too The bag is great because then I don t have to transfer to the toilet I just empty the bag into the toilet when I m done and throw the catheter in the trash I work as an engineer and sometimes I have to adjust my meetings a little bit or let someone know I ll be 10 min late if I have many scheduled back to back so that I have time to cath It s important to stay on a schedule that works for you I also keep some catheters in my desk drawer in case I forget to pack them in my bag in the morning  I think most people would give the suggestion of talking to your urologist about getting Botox in your bladder What are the exact issues you re having You re just having to go more often than you can cath  First don t expect your bladder to hold a tremendous amount of urine Between  400ml and 600ml is just fine  https   www webmd com urinary incontinence oab picture of the bladder 1   others may have  huge  bladders but it s not how much you can hold but how much back pressure is created against your kidneys   Second drink plenty of water Not plenty of coffee or caffeinated drinks but clear water Caffeinated drinks will cause more frequent urination If you add a splash of lemon juice to regular water  it will actually turn alkaline in your body  shift the pH up from 7 0   https   www healthyfoodhouse com why is lemon water alkaline     Third use a system like the  Bard Touchless system of catheters  http   www bardcare com clinicians products view products intermittent catheters touchless plus catheters and kits   as it is trivial to carry a few of the packages with you They allow you to use any room with a door as a restroom in an urgent situation I open the kits and repackage them inside a ziploc bag It s easy to carry seven of them in the back beneath my chair   Good luck and best wishes  Are you male or female  If you have control of your bladder or if the only one issue is leaking in the morning I highly recommend using condom catheters in the morning They don t extract the urine from your bladder but they will catch the urine if you leak  I don t have to go more often than I Cath It s the mornings that are the worst Leak a lot in the mornings rest of the day is fine Because of the leak in the morning I have to wear incontinence pads They are pretty difficult to change in a wheelchair Because of that I have to take assistance in the restroom Touchless catheters are not yet available in the country I reside I really wish they were takes away the pain of carrying so many things and the need for a proper big restroom I m a maleAnyone else have tingles in your legsYup have had them for all 19 years of paralysis  Since I have a complete injury I figure they re phantom sensations   If I run my fingers around my level of injury I can feel different sensations washing over my legs hips feet depending on where my fingers go  For example stroking my belly along the right side of my belly button causes a tingly sensation that wraps around the front of my right thigh and around the kneecap  One inch to the left of my belly button sets off the left thigh  four inches to the left brings tingles to my left shin   I can also send orders from my brain to tell my toes to move and it feels like my toes are slowly moving    but of course nothing is happening    Don t know exactly what s going on with any of this and honestly doctors have been no help in solving the mystery  if it s not a medical problem that s bothering you they generally don t like wasting time exploring it  I do know that the general consensus is that six months to a year is the window of time when you re most likely to get back any sensation you re going to get back  I also have a tingling numbness feeling in my legs sometimes happening randomly sometimes when i think about moving my legs T3 4 complete for almost 2y It sounds like classic nerve pain C6 complete quad here I have no sensation from my level of injury down However I get the tingles you re referring too It soon goes from a tingle to feel like my legs and torso are wrapped in a hot compression sleeve that s lined with cactus needles I tried medication like gabbapenton and lyrica but that had me in dark depression with suicidal thoughts Cannabis helps alleviate the pain almost immediately  I get em too First thought that it was neuro recovery but 18  years later no recovery but still get tingly Frequency increases whenever I m feeling chilly   If I run my fingers around my level of injury I can feel different sensations washing over my legs hips feet depending on where my fingers go   I have this happen as well It still amazes freaks me out 4 years post accident My girlfriend was rubbing my shoulder blade last night right about injury level and I felt it in my thighs and butt Completely agree with you From what I have heard 6 months to a 1 5 year window in terms of recovery  Also Quad c5 c6 here Pretty much i too experience the pins and needless at times and at times i too can feel moving my toes sometimes there will be a flicker but that is as far as I have got in the close to the 12 years of injury Just curious  this is fascinating to me  did this start immediately after your injury or a few months in Academic survey  Are you living with a spinal cord injury I m not eligible to participate but I do want to know more about SCI and aging Will you guys share some of your results at the end  US residents only or will you accept answers from anyone anywhere  How much are you paying  We will review feedback in the fall and present on locally Not sure if there will be an online web component to share I ll be sure to bring it up to the group and our advisors Sounds like it would be beneficial Thank you for mentioning this point Same here 20 female 3 years ASIA DAs long as you re English speaking you can participate We are limited on time and translation resources hence this point as inclusion criteria Thank you for asking We re not providing compensation Thank you for asking After a SCS permant placementI think you re in the wrong sub Your question would be answered better somewhere else   This sub is for people with spinal  cord  injuries meaning an injury to the spinal cord that causes paralysis  God no I ve had two spinal surgeries The first one was due to my accident and I spent 4 days I m the icu 3 days in the main hospital and was then transferred to a rehab center where I spent a month in their hospital area doing physical rehab while I healed Most travel I had to go in for a syrinx and even then I spent a day post OP in icu and 3 days on the regular floor Spinal surgery is no joke it hurts like hell and no dance doctor should be pushing you out quickly The procedure op is talking about is totally different It is no more than a small incision and two wires inserted in the spine   OP does not actually have a spinal cord injury They mostly likely had a spinal column injury Make leg spasms relax psychedelicsYep That s spinal cord injury and drugs Just be in a safe place when you do it I ve had to go home from clubs cus I didn t feel safe with the spasms There s really no way of stopping your nerves from firing but shows you that these drugs do stimulate everything  Might be useful to try supplements like magnesium or anti oxidants I know that magnesium helps with jaw clenching when taking mdma so might be useful  I tripped for the first time since my injury  5 years  a few weekends back I was ok on spasms but I fucked up and didn t catheter before the peak I get a painful sensation when my bladder is full that hit right at the same time as shit really hit the fan in my brain I tried once and gave up half way through While I didn t pee myself it really detracted from the amazing acid When I finally came down enough and rolled out to cath it was night and day  I ve had an SCI for 3 years and still like the shrooms I strap my feet to the footplate and strap my thighs to the chair Sometimes the spasms get so severe that the front of the chair bounces up and down miniature wheelies Just buckle up you ll be fine Bro I love my drugs like the next man but I m scared to take shrooms with my sci Idk ya condition but being wheelchair bound I think I may try to do some shit I m physically can t anymore   end up on the floor helpless lol I was going to try micro dosing psilocybin got myself a half o Took 1 at most the first night and my legs locked up for the next twelve hours I couldn t imagine taking enough to trip and what that would have done  Interesting  I ve never used LSD  too scared  but I have done shrooms a couple of times  Never had issues with spasms   I don t have issues with spasms normally though so perhaps that is why  I take shrooms and smoke or eat a lot of THC at the same time or else my spasms will throw me outta my chair I usually kick it in bed trip a bit and smoke eat a lot of THC  The THC not only helps my spasms but also helps me come down and be able to sleep after   I haven t tried micro dosing yet but maybe it s not so spastic I ll have to do some experimenting and get back to you or you let us know     deleted  Do you take baclofen regularly  I dropped last weekend and yes can confirm the leg spasms are intense  Even for the next few days they were noticibly tighter than usual  Still a great experience but much agreed it would have been a lot better without having to worry about that  Side note I candy flipped so that might have made them even worse than just LSD  Glad to hear DMT spasms only last for the duration  Did it once pre injury and have plans to blast off again sometime soon  stretch a bunch ty legs down for  mdma Shrooms lsd good luck tammming those beast  Ye I guess   Gonna try magnesium   I throw on an indwelling catheter and a leg bag if I m drinking beers or going anywhere or doing anything where it would be a pain in the ass to cath  Sooooo much better definitely recommend Damn that doesn t sound fun at all how did it hit the fan when you couldn t cath Did the trip go downhill so to say That s actually genius Gna try that next time That s why you don t do them alone nevertheless i ve done them a few times and never gotten so out of it that I tried doing something I can t do but always have a trip sitter with you   It s definitely a pain in the ass lol the trip is still enjoyable but it would be 10 times better without these fucking spasms and brutal sweats I literally sweat buckets on LSD and shrooms I need to have a towel nearby at all times to wipe off my forehead and shit I don t have spasms usually either used to have a lot when I was younger tho Unfortunately I can t smoke weed currently because of a few different circumstances    Haven t tried microdosing either sadly nor do I have any shrooms or lsd   Aye the spasms truly sucks luckily mine arent so bad that they ruin the whole experience it just fucks it up a bit is all Nope never been on itYup Did DMT today SO fucking hard to keep taking hits when the legs are going mad and i m already breathless from all the constant shakes oh well still a nice experience Incompletes who have days they can walk any tips for coping with the dissonance of it all Your comfort and safety should be first and that s with using a chair If you re mother doesn t understand this she really needs a reality check I m sorry you have to deal with this  I had a period of time where I could walk with a walker and I pushed myself so so hard to do that as often as possible and avoid my chair The only this accomplished was exhausting me physically and emotionally  it was like I was trying desperately to hold onto the ability to walk because I was so terrified of having to use a chair full time  I wish I had been able to accept that walking just wasn t going to be a thing anymore back then I can t even say that I ultimately chose the chair because it was ultimately surgical complications that made it impossible to walk so the choice was kind of made for me I know it s not the same situation you re in since mine was self imposed but I definitely understand the cognitive dissonance it can create   When I was still in my stubborn I will walk and nobody can stop me phase I saw a physiatrist who tried his best to make see sense One thing he said did stick with me The gist of it was to think carefully about how I use the energy I have and if there s something I can do to make things easier and less painful time consuming energy zapping I should do it to help conserve my energy for both the other things I have to do and more importantly the things I want to do   As far as your mom I think by your replies below you ve realized she s gotta snap out of it and encourage you to do what is best for your health and safety I m sorry that you don t have a more supportive mother I was in the interesting position of having a mom who had been in a chair my whole life so I had the opposite problem   she tried to get me to switch to a chair long before I really needed to  I had a hard time using the phrase  I have a disability  for years because I can walk Outwardly I look okay I should probably have a walker or cane but I essentially walk around with 1 and a half leg power and muscle memory which is starting to wane after the last ten years On a good day I zip around with little issue though I ll never run again On a bad day I limp badly clutch walls sit in a rolling chair as much as possible   I can do stairs if I don t have to carry anything but at the top I m dead on my feet I can hold a baby for twenty minutes or a small toddler for five minutes before my knee buckles and down I go   My friends are kind enough to drop me at the front door of a place we visit or match my pace if it s a longer walk and understand if I have to sit for a bit once we re inside They ve had a better handle on the situation than I have because I won t just ask for help if I need it   I only recently started getting some adaptive equipment for the house so I don t kill myself on tasks that used to be simple but now can steal my momentum in just a few movements   Point is  Just because you can do a thing even under mighty stress doesn t mean you should Don t give up on a thing just because it s hard but learn where your new limits are so you don t do yourself more damage Accept help when offered and needed  And learn to ask for help   I have to tell at least one person a week that I cannot lift a case of paper but I can carry a couple of reams if needed  Hyperextending your knees is not good as it will cause a lot of trouble down the road  If you feel more secure safer and accepted in your chair then you should absolutely use it all the time It seems like your Mom wants you to walk for her and not for you Keep yourself safe and as emotionally healthy as possible and she will either accept it or not But it sounds like she has some baggage that s making her react to your chair the way she does  Definitely do what is best for your health and safety You are the number one priority Do you think your mom dislikes the chair because she is worried about you losing muscle Maybe something you could work on are strength training exercise with a physio therapist That way you can use the chair but if you have that rare moment where you want to move your legs and bare weight you can if you choose too  Moms gotta learn to understand that this ain t about what she wants or likes to see it s about you   your happiness I don t know what to tell u about how to deal with this shit myself but keep ya head up I completely agree with you Tonight actually I m going to have a discussion with her about it because it struck me that if I m out and fall someplace unfamiliar or my legs give in somewhere public then I m kinda stuck Not sustainable I don t know why that just struck me now Hey thanks for your response I do sometimes have the fear of the fact that I won t walk again  as soon as my mother snaps to reality  but tbh it s more just that when I am managing to walk I feel   beyond pain and fear   hugely inauthentic People will react to me as if I m just walking weird whereas when I m using my chair I feel I can deal with anything and people react to me based off well me That dissonance of going from hey I m being me to  I don t know how I m perceived   it s a bit weird   I ve been walking  read as using walls and sitting down at every possible opportunity  for 4 hours now and I m wrecked It s for sure the most painful and engery zapping exhausting thing I ve done Feels like neuro rehab all over again I had a discussion with my mother about what exactly incomplete at C means and she says it s not  bad enough  to necessitate my chair   I miss my chair   only gotta get through another 18 hours with possibility of walking   I m glad things are working out for you   and I m glad your family are supportive I d wager its a pretty important thing to have Yeah so for years whilst my impairment was declining I became pretty comfortable intellectually with being disabled but I think that intellectual understanding was a really good way to have no emotional understanding at all This year having to use the chair p much fulltime has been intense emotionally because I had to confront the  you re going to be doing this for the rest fo your life  and tbh I m still working through it Though sports and getting to know other wc users help massively Your bad day walking is my every day walking   I can barely lift my feet off the ground I drag them and bear down on only really my right leg My doctors say essentially I m bearing down through bone and that knee hyperextension I mentioned earlier I shouldn t by all medical professionals opinon be walking even though I have some motor in my legs As you said working off momentum and walls   I think before my level and degree of completeness was certain I found it easy to go  oh well y know its just my spine s messed up but it doesn t impact me much  when I was using mostly crutches sometimes walking to get around But now its certain and I ve been using the chair essentially fulltime for a year whenever I have to walk I can t pretend I m not really screwing myself over I have no sensation except random nerve pain in my legs so its like trying to walk on stilts that don t always work   I think you re right and I need to actually internalise that I don t have to walk that being in enough pain to make you physically sick after a very short period of time is not sustainable I ll keep working on it because the progress I ve made over the past year doesn t have to stop just because I still have some hang ups about walking If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide please do not hesitate to talk to someone     US     Call 1 800 273 8255 or text HOME to 741 741    Non US      https   en wikipedia org wiki List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  https   en wikipedia org wiki List_of_suicide_crisis_lines              I   am   a   bot    Feedback   appreciated Yeah i know   rehab were very clear on the matter just before I left Yeah i told her that she has some hang ups with wheelchairs she needs to address but it s p tough going She believes wheelchairs cause you not to be  healthy  and that herbalism can functionally cure an SCI I just came out of a month of neuro rehab to deal with some dystonia in my left leg so as to avoid contracture and have joined a gym Her worries are actually more sociological than psychological though she believes that you cannot be physically healthy and use a wheelchair Her major issue she says is that i will learn to identify as a  wheelchair user  and that it will limit my life Thanks    and yeah she really does I just woke up after 1st day walking in a while and this level of wrecked isn t sustainable at all Bladder augmentation surgeryI had it done 25 years ago It expands your bladder to allow greater volume as mine was occasionally leaking No leaks at all in 25 years I intermittently self cathaterise and get a mild UTI about once every 3 years 11 10 would recommend  Bladder Botox is usually effective and preferred these days before moving to augmentation  I heard it can increase the risk of infection But I am by no means an expert I really don t know too much about it I ve heard people with both good and bad experiences The recovery can take a long time  That sound awesome What was the recovery like Just got mine done in January and Very Happy to read your experience with it had over 10 UTIs in first 3 years with my suprapubic so I m glad to hear the success of your BA How does that work Helping my niece  12  accept that she may never live life like she used tooWhen she gets down let her  Within reason  It s a traumatic and depressing reality to face  Just try and be understanding  On the plus side I think there are advantages to having something like this happen at a younger age Especially the age she s at Becoming a teenager and finding out who you are is something a lot of kids struggle with Her struggle is going to be different but it s a time of change and confusion already I know that makes it sound like this is just piling things on but that s not what I mean It s hard to explain I was paralyzed from the chest down a few months shy of my 14th birthday I truly believe that having this happen at the age it did really helped my recovery At that point you know a bit about life but there s a lot more to learn You don t have the view of being an adult and thinking you know what your life is and what it s all about and then having the rug pulled out from under you She s at an age where she ll experience all sorts of new things This will be one of them I m 34 years old now If I had been paralyzed now as opposed to when I was 14 I think I d be way more devastated and would find it hard to be positive Kids are resilient Things will be hard for her but I think she ll find the positive side of life as well Best of luck to you and her Always remind her that life isn t over and she still has a great future ahead of her Look to the future and don t get stuck in the past  Oh gosh that is such a horrible thing to happen   I don t really have any advice other than to surround her with love and support  Having family and friends that are caring and compassionate is hugely beneficial in dealing with a thing such as this  She will still be able to do almost everything someone who walks can do She ll have to learn how to do it differently but she ll be able to do it   Recently Ali Stroker received a Tony award for her performance on Broadway There are also quite a few wheelchair users with a decent YouTube presence    Try not to force the positivity too much on your niece or her parents 10 days isn t very long and mourning will be important for everyone  Never tell her that she will never walk again Medicine and science is evolving everyday There have already been successful studies of some people walking again after a spinal chord injury   Life will not be the same as she will require extensive physical therapy maybe occupational therapy and a lot of support This month marked 9 years since I was injured C4 C5 TBI According to the doctors I initially wasn t going to make it out of the hospital alive   Stay positive and optimistic That and my prayers are what keep me going Wishing your family the best  I became paralyzed form a gunshot as well and I was 13 at the time From personal experience the best advice I could give is telling her the truth because if you don t she will continue to wonder why she isn t able to walk yet However also let her know that she will be able to do everything she was able to Lastly family is really important so try to be with her as much as possible  Just remember she won t really remember these hardest days as she grows up It s hard but she ll adapt better because she s a kid  If she d like to talk to another young woman who acquired a spinal cord injury feel welcome to give her my username I broke my back at 17 and am 20 now I am 28 now and last year was in an accident and suffered from a spinal cord injury I have regained some of my function and can walk short distances but I honestly can say that things will get better I was extremely depressed at first and was self conscious about using my wheelchair walking aids but now I don t even think about it when I leave the house Her true friends will stick by her side no matter what  Is it an incomplete or complete injury If it s incomplete then it s really early on to say she ll never walk again I m c5 incomplete and I couldn t move anything below my neck fue the first few days My left leg didn t move at all for the first free weeks They told my friends and family that I d probably never walk again but no one ever told me that I don t know if it helped not hearing that but I held onto to the belief that I d walk again and I can now  get her to Shirley Ryan Ability Lab in Chicago  She needs to hit therapy 110  as soon as she is able to What level injury asia is she  True and realistic  I just dont want her to dwell and think its not worth it  I cant let her discourage herselfThanks she is very strong and I can see her adapting quickly but it may be irritating as she loves basketball which she can still play  I bope she doesnt wonder what people think  I deal with that now and im not even in her position  I can see her being strong passed that as well   Future is my whole thing and i do get mixed feelings thinking about it but i need to make sure I feel more optimistic especially since she looks up to me so much Really   My sister is jusy worried she may not do eveything she did when growing up but she will and get the most out of life and she is resilient already Support and compassion is what Im on right now but my mom cant handle her emotions  Shes a heavy drinker and Ive been babysitting her throughout this ordeal already   It stresses me out  Hurts me to see her drink  We are able to handle everything financially and all have good stable jobs and my mom retired  Dad right behind her in the next year or two  My mom is already babysitting my niece and nephew a lot since my sister is a flight attendant I think she is upset thinking about the caregiving part  How itll all be different and my mom is really sensitive too  Its just a whole different situation that I need undef control Noted and thanks  Thats my viewpoint but my sister I feel may be overbearing in finding procedures or a study or trial  Im worried it may irritate my niece if she keeps pushing a cure especially if she accepted it already   Keeping our heads up as well and hoping for the best and right people to meet her and help her in whichever way friends doctors wholesome strangersCompletely agree Quad here 11 5 years of injury Like it s mentioned don t take it a writing on stone about not walking again For each person body and the extent of damage is different and the way the body responds is different Best thing is this child is very young so the chances of a more than normal expected recovery is possible   Secondly the first 2 years are golden Get her to a good rehab and ask her to put in her maximum I am sure the outcome will be beyond what the doctor has predicted   Prayers and best wishes to your niece God bless and wishing her a speedy recovery Thanks a lot Its such a flash that your life can change  I think anyone on this sub can relate to that in some way  I know how much being there for her will mean to her The best for her is in our interest  Shepherd Center refused her due to her investigation being ongoing    She flies free since my sister is a flight attendant and ive spoken to my sister about this    Id like to push this as well and do what I can if we do make a temporary moveDoes this sound familiar to anyone Hi I m not a doctor nor in the medical field but I am a C4 C5 quadriplegic Rather than continuing to spend money on MRIs and doctors that you feel are giving you the run around I would personally look into finding a renowned neurologist or spinal specialist  Loosing sensation in your penis and lower body is more than just erectile dysfunction The more athletic the better you are to staying fit and getting better Wishing you the best of luck getting to the bottom of your situation  how come neurological tests of the sacral nerves is expensive because insurance will not cover  I take Lyrica for nerve pain and have found it to work wonders I started on a smaller dose but it s as though the nerves adapted and started raging again Increased the dose and have had good success though this has happened twice   I have a T10 compression fracture causing complete paralysis from the belly button down At the zone of inhibition feeling I get intense nerve flare ups Although different there may be some commonality Ask your doc about the meds I mentioned if you haven t discussed them at all Maybe they will make this more manageable   Wish you the best   I agree with jdawg003  Find a doctor who doesn t laugh when you ask questions or have concerns That is a must when you are dealing with any health issue There are neurologists orthopedic doctors and physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors who specialize in what you are discussing I know the cost can be substantiatal but any amount of money would be worth it to me to have answers and potentially feel better each day I have been trying my best to stay athletic but it becomes harder every year As I have stated below I am currently looking into finding more experienced specialists but unfortunately I am having trouble keying in on where to look and who to see   It is silly how satisfying it is to read that you understand that my problem is more than just ED but I guess I should have been expecting that when posting to this board It took years before seeing the neurologist who performed my sacral nerve testing and that was really the first person to believe me undeniably   Thank you for you well wishes and input I hope for the best for you as well Look for the specialists at big research hospitals they may have more interest in an uncommon condition Be sure to send them all the test results from what you have done already before your appointment and don t downplay your pain when you meet with them You might have to wait longer for an appointment so don t be surprised if the wait is a few months for a new patient visit It was expensive because there were no specialists in my area who know how to perform the testing for anything lower than s1 nerves  or s2 I can t remember  From what I understand not many specialists perform testing on those nerves period Because the big area of concern for me is the saddle region I spent a more expensive amount of money for travel and an evaluation by one of the said specialists I will talk to my doctor at my next available appointment about trying it I ve tried gabapentin but to be honest I did not feel enough difference to continue Thank you for the input and the well wishes I hope for the best for you as well Benign spinal cord tumour cyst with acquired non traumatic spinal cord injuryHi It sounds like you also have tethered spinal cord  I did too  to a lipoma at L5 S1   Have you heard of lipomyelomeningocele I would check that out  Your story sounds similar to mine    Any and all advise is welcome   Well depending on tumor type and location radiation or chemotherapy might be additional treatment options  Sorry that was meant to say T11 L2 Update now    Sorry all for my delay in responding to you all I m in Ireland and assuming you good folks are in the states with the time difference really appreciate all your comments  Hi thanks for replying That does sound similar just did a quick google of it and will do a lot more later   For me they reckoned maybe spina bifida occulta where my spinal column didn t close over until week 8 9 in the womb normally this would be weeks 5 6 it sort of make sense with my family history too 1 older sister living with spina bifida and a sister who passed away shortly after birth at 3 months and a brother who we never met both with severe spina bifida Epidermoid rumours are usually associated with SB Occulta I ve never had an official diagnosis this has just been mentioned in passing by quite a few different doctors   From the quick google if looks like surgery is the intervention of choice for lipomyelomeningocele too Is that what caused your injury Is that the action they took for you too How many surgeries have you had so far Sorry lots of questions hope you don t mind   I suppose one of the biggest questions I have is how many surgeries has anyone had for something like this before the found themselves in chair permanently I m assuming repeated surgeries in the same place on my spinal cord will over time cause damage in their own right Hey thanks for replying It s epidermoid definitely as they did a biopsy after the first surgery The surgeon did talk about CyberKnife after my last surgery but now says that s not effective with an epidermoid tumours  It s looking like I m stuck with surgery Autonomic DysreflexiaI was prescribed Sudafed to keep my blood pressure up so I believe some decongestants can raise your blood pressure and high blood pressure is a key element of autonomic dysreflexia Talk to your doctor about the use of these decongestants they very well could be a factor  Don t hesitate to call 911 if you can t identify or quickly correct the cause of AD Be prepared to tell the operator or ambulance crew what autonomic dysreflexia is and that it s life threatening if not corrected Nitroglycerin paste applied topically can be prescribed to lower your blood pressure to keep you from stoking out until you get the cause resolved Keep an automatic blood pressure cuff handy so you can learn what your bp feels like when it s just elevated versus dangerously high and also so you can give the reading to 911 rescue   As far as causes a blocked catheter is the only thing that does it to me but be prepared for surprises as your body changes Intense or painful stimulus  whether or not you have sensation  below the level of your injury will set it off in some people e g  sunburn ingrown toenail broken bone pressure ulcer orgasm full bladder etc  Decongestants shouldn t be Triggering it You should mention it to your doctor because that doesn t sound normal Maybe find a different decongestant if it is it cause  UTIs do cause AD all the time but if you are getting it when you do not have a UTI it s signs of a greater problem and you should probably talk to your doctor maybe get a CT scan below your level of injury to make sure there aren t any fractures or other complications that could be triggering it  Buy an airfilter for your home If you have a cheapo AC filter from Home Depot throw it out and splurge on a good one They block a lot more allergens bacteria viruses and more You can also wear a facemask when youbare outdoors like chinese people do due to bad pollution For the UTI get antibiotics from your dr There is really nothing else to do with this one  Thanks I do have high blood pressure so I have a blood pressure cuff that I keep nearby I just had an MRI and there is nothing new Thanks for your help Thank you for the advice SCI ResourcesMay I add   Rutgers Care Cure Community  http   carecure rutgers edu   Thank you  I d also suggest  SCIREproject com  https   SCIREproject com  and SCIRE community the plain language version This is a site that is a systematic review of research evidence on rehabilitation and acute care of spinal cord injury and is regularly updated If you ve ever wondered what the actual research evidence is behind a given treatment  ie is FES cycling actually effective What about locomotor training Cannabis for spasticity   this is a great way to actually get a sense for what research evidence as a whole has found about it The clinician version of the site itself isn t hard to read itself but can be harder to sort through The Community version of it is really easy to zero in on the specific topic but doesn t provide as much of the research data and discussion  https   scireproject com community   https   scireproject com community    Another I d suggest is  SCISexualHealth ca  https   SCISexualHealth ca  a guide to sexual health information and practice for people with SCI and similar conditions  Research Survey OpportunityMy toddler daughter has

still correct   Keep us updated lots of us are interested in this Good luck and quick recovery  Would love to know how it goes for you Good luck and be well  Keep us posted Just got out of  surgery  boy am In pain What level are you  Keep us posted  Also thinking about this but really not sure  This is the trial It is being done in the pain management office If it works The permanent device will

probably getting an implanted spinal cord stimulator for pain it s been on the market for 20 years How are you recovering Notice any difference No unfortunately  Everything gastrointestinal is still in the air   they are at battle with my insurance still   This stimulator is for my back painAny sci survivors who did not get to spinal fusion surgery In 2006  July 31st actually yay crippled birthday      I crushed my T12 L5 and had 2 laminectomy surgeries but no fusions However due to increasing pain over time I ve been looking into it lately   Not sure if it would be effective  and doctors just throw their collective hands in the air in confusion over what to do     but Im willing to try anything after 13 years of neuropathic and extremely bad lumbar pain  In 2009 I broke my C5 C6 C7 vertebrae and I didn t have spinal fusion surgery I did have to wear a halo for 6 months instead   Today I m classified as a C6 complete quadriplegic Me L4 L5 spinal fractures and L4 S1 herniated discs plus a Tarlov cyst   I have Ehlers Danlos also and I m really glad I chose just pain management I ve been doing well in that aspect  T 12 L 1   no fusion here I have not had fusion t2 9 arachnoid cysts  I m a t4 and I ve never heard of a fusion helping with sci Broke mine in 1997 c5 6 never needed a fusion I have a little scoliosis but it s not getting worse  Don t plan on ever getting one as long as long as can manage my scoliosis from getting worse I m never gonna get one I had spinal fusion after a laminectomy and discectomy on my back and a discectomy but with a bone graft and carbon framework on my back Years ago my mum had screws and plates for something similar on her back Whereas nowadays the above above is done Can I ask what you ve had  Smashed into a telephone pole while riding a bicycle back in  80 subluxated two vertebrae right at T 4 They hauled me to Tripler Army Medical Center put me into a crank up bed and I lay there for two months No surgery  A bunch of my vertebrae are anchored with screws to 10 cm rods in my back but they said the hardware will loosen over time One decade later I m definitely more able to twist Could also be because I ve been doing an adapted yoga class for two years though  2003 c6 crushed on an august bank holiday weekend so all specialists on holiday No surgery or halo offered and being consciously aware of my hand function decreasing was the worst experience of my life Interesting is there a reason why you didn t get the spinal fusion Do you regret it If your Tarlov cyst ends up causing dysfunction please consider surgery The deterioration can be rapid and aggressive I have EDS too and am 12 days post op from a cousin of the Tarlov cyst  sacral meningocele  I went from walking to wheelchair in about a year It added to my hip instability too I can still walk but I slightly sublux my hips with every few steps   From one friendly EDSer to another don t just brush off neuropathic pains as EDS pains like I did Sure I m a C5 C6 incomplete They decompress my spine for a day or 2 I can t remember And then I had 2 spinal fusion stabilization surgeries One in the front which has a plate and one in the back which is rods and screws Ada compliance from an hoaHOAs have no obligation to make modifications to a house however they can t say that you can t have a ramp  at least that s what it s like in Texas when I was looking for a house here  I m a C6 C7 quadriplegic and decided to avoid HOAs because they are such a pain in the ass  Put your state and maybe Crosspost over to r legaladvice They probably have the best information to go about this  I googled and found this answer from a law firm  https   www ksnlaw com blog associations responsibilities comply accessibility standards   http   accessadvocates com condominium buildings avoid compliance   It appears that they don t have to make it accessible for you  If they re did the parking lot and weren t in compliance with your state s building codes  most of which have incorporated the ADA standards from the federal guidelines  then it would be an easier argument but if everything is old and hasn t been updated then you might be stuck with  u cooterscuz s answer which isn t a great situation They do have to let you make adaptations though and can t tell you that your ramp is ugly so you have to get rid of it  Possible causes a  Grossly Loose Peek Implant  What s your question  Hello  I m wondering what would cause a  Grossly Loose Peek implant  less than a year after surgery Had to make this after I saw

considerate    Hello Mr Research Associate   I am in the process of creating a collaborative research doc collating every single method of recovery EVER This also includes many unrecognised methods that got buried At the moment I am just looking for papers to assign to each category  There s 36  so far  The internet is really jumbled up and there s a lot of paid access papers and articles writing about papers but really we want the actual papers which is not easy Once I ve got at least the draft links ready I ll start opening it up on here to those who wish to contribute   That s the first stage collecting titles research papers and other resources We will then need people who can take excerpts and work out the most successful methods of applying that  category  They don t teach this stuff in schools for sure its time to give power back to those with SCI and give them options and involvement in research   I am fully aware of most of the applications of electricity and I m feeling very positive about that But I want a cure 100  mobility returned and the only way is to troubleshoot every single method Then there s no central point of failure and also everyone will be able to see what stage we re at   Might need another week though  didn t realise that there s actually a lot hiding in my head Trying to do many things at once as well so I just add to it a few hours each day on G drive Maybe then research centers can allocate resources to treatments that aren t always profitable  At the moment if the Pharmaceutical tech industry can t make money no research interest That s very wrong and not how it should be Not to say I m against profit but if it is slowing progress I am   Is Kessler becoming part of the Reeves foundation network of labs   https   www

org blog daily dose join the reeve foundation at the kessler foundations free conference this month  I was reading an article not too long ago and basically the gist of the article was we need to reevaluate what we consider to be a  cure   If you are talking about recovering to the point before a spinal cord injury I would say we are a long time off from that But if you are talking about a cure that involves possibly standing for short periods of time maybe even taking a few steps or maybe partial use of your paralyzed hands I don t think we are too far from that possibility It s somewhere up there with fusion power and the cure for cancer Though I would bet that those two will come sooner Best voice command phone and other assistive devices when healing from spinal injury Apple All the way for me Happy to discuss but iOS 13 beta has some great features that will really change things    look here for example  https   youtu be aqoXFCCTfm4  Wow that s amazing Thank you so much    Any phone with talk to text is very helpful Apple is running a campaign now with devices to help people with disabilities Bluetooth headsets are very handy  no pun intended  as well When you receive a phone call all you have to do is say answer call and it s all hands free  Coming up on 14 months since my L2 L3 SCI and have not been sick once   no fever no common cold nothing Not complaining just very confused why Anyone else have a similar experience or have heard why how this might happen Was in hospital 2 of those months Is it possible to have a spinal cord injury and not know about it I did I still don t know what did it I have suspicions but there was never a time were I said I had a spinal injury I was having some issues with my arms they would fall asleep when I raised them above my head I also had tingling in my arms after a long day  I thought this was a Carpal tunnel Shortly after this my legs started to cramp up and just hurt real bad Some days walking was very taxing  I thought this was Arthritis  I am 43  then one day I stuck my right foot in the tub and grabbed some soap from the shelf and then put my left foot in I immediately realized I had forgot to run the cold water on as my left foot felt on fire My right foot however did not feel any temperature  I started testing and realized my entire right side was not experiencing temperature Meanwhile a few days later I had a EKG    of my arms  and the doctor told me I did indeed have a mild carpal tunnel I told him well if this is mild I wonder what severe was I explained to him I had pain throughout my arms he suggested something else was wrong I told him about the temperature thing and he then told me I might have something wrong with my neck Eventually my GP finnaly got me a MRI and they thought I had a tumor on my spinal cord After seeing a specialist he informed me that I did not that my spinal fluid is leaking out because one of my disk had smashed my spinal cord and it looked like a mass He did a diskotomy and fusion of my c3 4 He told me post op that I had some serious bruising and damage I ended up having some permanent damage I never recovered the temperature feeling and I have neuropothy down my entire right side but mostly in my leg and the bottom of my foot  I did get feeling back in my arms So yes you can have a spinal cord injury and not know it   deleted  Often articles aren t very preccise with their language My guess is what they are really describing when they say this kind of stuff is the person had a spinal injury with no damage to the spinal column  It happens most often in osteo degenerative diseases where the bones are fragile and the breaks are not traumatic but can happen ini traumatic injuries too Then down the road you stretch your sore neck and the spinal damage which was previously unknown inflicts cord damage with all the fun signs and symptoms that follow  I think a lot of people coming here think a spinal cord injury is an injury to the spinal column lol If you are trying to self diagnose you are almost guaranteed to be wrong  If you are really worried go to your GP describe your symptoms and they will refer you appropriately  A lot can be gathered from symptom patterns onset etc alone  I have a nontramatic SCI and although I didn t know for sure it was a spinal cord injury before clear imaging came back we were like p sure on the symptomology alone However nothing is truly known until proven with spinal  and general neuro stuff  Its definitely possibly to have an SCI and not know but until you know   you can t diagnose because numbness neurpathic pain movement issues para quad   all of that  and more  can have other causes that are within the brain or even psychology of the patient  I m not so sure You might have but you would have a VERY VERY incomplete SCI  Asia D close to a Asia E  What you present is your diagnosis   I saw an article that said it s possible but I am not so sure   The symptoms are usually obvious It may be possible to misattribute their cause though  It sounds more like r healthanxiety  thank you for sharing your experience that s pretty crazy So your right leg and right foot all don t experience temperature It seems like the x ray I had was pointless and I should ve gotten an MRI instead Right I got an x ray and from what I ve read x rays are never good at showing spinal cord injuries I ll have to convince my doctor to let me get an MRI soon Need a referral in my country I wish I did more research before I went to the doctor Add incomplete paralysis  muscle weakness  to the list That is my thought Can you educate us Right I got an x ray and from what I ve read x rays are never good at showing spinal cord injuries I ll have to convince my doctor to let me get an MRI soon What were your symptoms What is para quad Electricity Conducting Bacteria May Inspire Next Gen Medical DevicesMystery SymptomsI don t know exactly what you are going through but I ve had plenty of UTI s They all suck I m surprised no one mentioned D mannose I get it from Amazon it s good for bladder health   My urologist is great I think you might need a new one   I don t know if you or anyone on here has had to have a small camera about the size of a catheter inserted in their bladders but I ve had to have it done twice The first time I left pretty upset because even I could see there was damage to my bladder walls The second time I had it done I had discovered and was practicing qigong especially on my bladder I had started taking extra vitamin C to increase acidity in my bladder and started taking d mannose daily and my bladder looked better than the first time I know that sounds crazy but I told the urologist what I was doing and he said to keep doing it   I had a doctor go back and forth with me when I had a UTI and it was a whole ordeal I don t even want to talk about that but I mention it because I realized at that time that Dr s seem to treat me like I m an idiot Very condescending and not interested in helping It sounds like your Dr s treat you the same way I think as disabled people we automatically look like we have hypochondria or are needy for attention so our conditions get brushed aside  they just want attention  I m truly sorry for how you feel right now I m glad you have a place to vent Good luck I hope you get answers and proper treatment soon  The never ending UTIs whether we get the germs from the hospital or another source they are extremely tough to deal with  I also do not treat for odor cloudiness because all Drs  say you will become resistant to most oral antibiotics  We re told colonized bladder does not need to be treated BUT it still causes increased spasticity burning urine  shrinking bladder with frequency  I m 40 yrs post injury   only seen Two things that can help the odor   keep colonization down One method is to irrigate your bladder daily with  RENACIDIN  The other option I use is to take Hyprex 1 gram   500 MG vitamin C twice daily  stay hydrated   urine stays mostly clear as long as you try to empty bladder every few hours With either method I can still get symptomatic if I let my urine get to Alkaline by eating too much fruit or too much calcium from dairy Hydrate diluted urine has less odor  humid days magnify the odor empty bag more often   Good luck  My recommendation is always to let microbiology guide what antibiotics you should be on Strange colors can be associated with bacteria from my experience even lime green fluorescent  All I can offer is empathy I m currently trying desperately to discover my recent severe pain that builds by the end of the day I fear it s about four things but relieving or intensifying the pain is so inconsistent Switch to comfy shoes might or might not help swollen feet Try to irritate a suspected painful hip same inconsistency     x200B   I had endless UTIs for years intermittently catheterizing Switched to hydrophylic caths and upped my vitamin C solved that problem That likely doesn t help your case but I empathize  I had a uti for about 7 months and I through much searching I found an infectious disease doctor that was willing to treat me I have almost  normal  bladder function so it made sense to treat a colonized bacteria I had to do an IV treatment My spasms improved a ton as well as overall energy and bladder control In my experience finding a good neuro urologist that works directly with an infectious disease doctor is key  I remember reading that purple bag syndrome is caused by high alkalinity UTIs  Also pseudomonas smells fruity  I have tried d mannose but about ten years ago perhaps I need to revisit it   Yes you are right about the attitude of some health care professionals I find the community nurses the worst for this and have managed to decrease their involvement to one visit every 6 weeks   Oddly enough my urologist is my favourite one I ve had The main problem I find is lack of communication waiting times and follow up plus all the other usual issues within the NHS  am in UK  I am eternally grateful for the NHS and never bash it but it is frustrating when you can clearly see that at the ground level very simple mistakes are made But I digress Ordeal is the right word you use there I fear many of us experience ordeals that are ultimately unnecessary if only we were listened to the first time   I d better get some vitamin C supplements as that has been mentioned a lot so far   Thank you for your insights   Qigong works I do a similar practice called universal energy healing Our minds and bodies are remarkable flesh machines Whichever God or entity put us here or evolution whatever you want to believe equipped us with everything we need to heal ourselves Ever since I started my energy practices I ve gotten more sensation and also stronger in my hands I have not been doing much hand therapy at all because I ve been focusing on local motor training and physical therapy more Which leads me to believe that it s working Of course it s not a cure all or magic pill I believe there are clinical trials with reiki and it was proved that the people who practice reiki had more healing than the other group Another cool thing is that you don t have to believe in it for it to work    Anyhow I know you probably heard all this I just wanted to elaborate and encourage others to try it also when you find a place make sure you find a place that doesn t charge you because this type of healing and type of work is based off of unconditional giving   I am in understanding that OP has a SP tube I just got rid of mine in January and got a mitrofanoff installed I ve only had it for a few months but ever since has been pretty smooth sailing I don t know if it s an option but maybe you can discuss it more with your urologist I got around 15 UTIs in the first two years when I was using an SP tube  having a tube inside you 24 7 is not very healthy I don t think Anyhow I m willing to answer any questions about the operation and the day to day life about it Just message me if you are interested After 40 years I can only imagine all the tips and tricks you have up your sleeve for various occasions   Yes I try and avoid antibiotics whenever possible I used to get treated for a uti about once in every 3 yrs which I felt to not be too bad But it s been one thing after another ever since I had kidney stones back in 2016 Idk if that s related but it did seem to be a catalyst Then the damn pseudomonas caused this blue nonsense I believe   Thanks for the suggestions I ll look into these for sure Aside from hydration I already drink around 4 litres per day as it is My urine looks like water most of the time just everything it touches seems to turn blue Yeah man I can t believe it took so long for my urologist to accept that it s bacterial Some Internet research reveals the link between odd colour and bacteria so I can t understand the reluctance to pursue this The community nurses suggested it was caused by beetroot BEETROOT How much beetroot do they think I eat that it s caused constant discolouration for two years Honestly enough to test the patience of a saint   My b vitamins give a fairly impressive lime green hue  DRight exactly Trying to figure these things out with your own trial and error or process of elimination is maddening and you feel really isolated when the medical professionals are even more bamboozled than yourself Good luck solving your mystery That s interesting If only it were fruity this is more like the smell of something you d expect to unclog a drain with or somthing need to stay dryThere are drugs you can take to keep your bladder from being too overreacting Regular drs should know about them  I use Oxybutynin Hydrochloride 3x5mg every morning first thing Stops the bladder spasms and gives you time to get yourself to somewhere you can catheterise yourself  Oxybutynin and flowmax One helps me void and the other stops spasms and leakage  I do a few things that all together help a lot  1 Botox injections in the bladder about once a year 2 Vescicare is medication that relaxes the bladder 3 Avoid drinking coffee and fizzy drinks 4 Drink green tea and water instead of coffee 5 CBD oil helps a lot for spasms and pain Wheelchair that lets you stand upCrazy cool  Crazy expensive And  in the

on Airlines  8217  RadarIs life really worth living with a very high level SCI I m only a t4 para but I m not gonna lie shit sucks sometimes but you have two options  give up or keep going As a group of people we are more prone to depression but one of the best explanations I ve heard so far is that we aren t suicidal but are just tired of living because everything is an uphill struggle Getting out of bed into a chair to go transfer to a bench to shower back to the chair then to bed to dress then back to the chair and we ve spent an hour just getting ready in the most basic sense   Someone s quality of life can only be determined by that person I have long told myself if I wasn t able to wipe my own ass I d rather be dropped out of a plane without a parachute With that being said though I have met through my own recovery many quads that are super happy because they have a significant other that they love and would fight to be with them As another poster said Stephen hawking is a great example of someone who was an extreme quad but fought through it all to be one of the most important people of the last century Life is what you make of it if you only dwell on the bad then it s bad but if you look for the good then it s good   Now with all that said I really fucking want use of my dick back I think that annoys me the most right now  You have Stephen Hawking who singlehandedly moved science forward a step so to speak But it s a matter of perspective Ppl have different reasons for wanting to live just as they have reasons for wanting to die   As long as opium and ecstasy exist I d be down to keep living I mnot gonna speak to the experience of being high level complete because I m lower cervical incomplete  c5 6  But should my injury worsen somehow and I end up somewhere along those lines I don t think I d wanna die A lot of people have told me  oh I couldn t live like that  or   oh I d kill myself  and I personally think its kinda bs People generally prefer survival over death I don t know why that would change if your level of support changed unless you were truly clinically depressed If vented quads say they re happy who are we to say they can t be   deleted  I m a lower incomplete quad so I m not exactly who you re talking about but life is good There are things that do suck tbh I wish my bladder bowel and sexual function could be better and I hate having nerve pain and aches from being in my chair But everyone has things in their life that they don t like and wish were better mine just happen to be more obvious Quads of any level can have very fulfilling happy lives We can go to college and have jobs We have friends who care about us and we can have romantic relationships We do things that we enjoy doing Life is good Why would I give that up   They can do absolutely nothing most can not breathe or even turn their heads  the highest quads    Most I m afraid you probably haven t met that many quads Sure there are some quads who can t control their head and are vent dependent but far more have incomplete injuries and can do quite a bit   For a little while about 18 months ago my husband couldn t wiggle his toes sit on the side of the bed handle his phone or feed himself He lost everything except his right bicep diapraghm shoulders and neck control He can now do all those things I listed has a lot of sensation and is able to walk with lots of assistance during physical therapy   His injury is still a C6 T2 like it was 18 months ago but he and 90  of all the C level quads I know are not like  most  high level quads you describe   Edit  I m not against physician assisted suicide but I think you re looking at a select few cases of SCI and expecting them to be the norm  Some people may feel that living as a high level quad is not acceptable to them  others may feel differently  I do agree with having the option of assisted suicide available although I certainly have strong concerns around societal attitudes about people being pressured into it or made to feel as if they are a drain or a burden and having that influence their decision   I don t even feel right discussing the lives of high level quads really because I m not one and don t have that life experience  As a para I don t appreciate it when able bodied people talk about how they don t think my life is worth living so why should I do that to someone else  Frankly I feel it s a bit arrogant and crude to pontificate on the worthiness of anyone else s life except your own and perhaps your very young children s  C3 C5 here I can do far more than you alluded to but I agree that the lack of a physician assisted suicide option is cruel I know many would take it  It s a question that each person can only answer for themselves  C6 here I hate everything bout this life I don t know what I m holding on for but I don t see myself living this life out       Definitely not What can a high level quadriplegic do other than blink They can t even breathe You are not a real human being if you re unable to breathe you are an artificial robot as far as I m concerned  IMO   With a solution to resolving SCI round the corner it is worth any of the suffering to stay alive If high level injury has really good carers quality of life can be better and also with technology lots and lots of money purpose etc Its a matter of perspective also although there is no comparison to being abled bodied Can control computers with BCI though soon most of the general population are plugged into their computers all day so they wouldn t miss moving as much as a Gymnast or MMA fighter rugby player etc etc So the mindset would be completely different If you ve ever seen the Matrix the mind is the most powerful tool and can create anything VR is pretty much

chair can go There is also an option to get cryo frozen with a lot of risk But personally I m sticking with working efficiently and finding the answer so nobody needs to experience paralysis long term at all I get my reason to live from that otherwise I would likely be dead already I think this is a legit question and I don t think it should be deleted but hopefully now you will learn from your mistake   There are answers to improve the quality of living if you ask the right questions   Getting out of bed into a chair to go transfer to a bench to shower back to the chair then to bed to dress then back to the chair and we ve spent an hour just getting ready in the most basic sense   This process alone makes me want to give up some days Let alone bowel bladder pressure sores back aches from sitting nerve pain awkward  chair is too big to fit through there  moments stair barriers  Alas there s a lot of great shit in this world and I d rather struggle through it than be 6 feet under Granted I m a  lucky  T12  So I guess I m not OP s target audience Though the SCI community isn t very big I know a lot of quads that agree Life can be good Ya just gotta wade through the shit sometimes to find it Stephen Hawking was a brilliant man but an outlier The vast majority cannot count on being a world renowned and quite wealthy theoretical physicist to ease the burden The comparison is not helpful And ecstasy can cause pretty severe spasms for quads  A lot of people have told me  oh I couldn t live like that  or   oh I d kill myself   Why in the bowels of hell do people say this  I hear it too I hate it  I know it s meant to be a  compliment  in a fucked up way but it s not Oh you think my situation is death worthy  Well fuck you very much   Sorry  RantI didn t mean any ill intent by this But being a vented quad doesn t seem like a worthy existence  deleted OrgasmSo yeah I got injured about 7 years ago and I have issues with ED I have viagra but it doesn t help me get off I mainly use it with a partner and that is just to keep it up while having sex     x200B   Something that I have very much started to enjoy is prostate massages  the ol  finger things up the butt  I have lost sensitivity but that really helps You gotta work up to it start with something small and use a lot of lube Prostate massage   hand can usually get me there     The tip of the penis techniques that the other commenters are saying work too but the orgasm is very different It is less complete and more sudden  In my experience Viagra doesn t necessarily help unless I m planning on having sex first They make special vibrators to help with orgasms which are super expensive I bought a Hitachi magic wand from walmart com and it does the job extremely well It only costs about  50 I would recommend going that route before spending a lot Also it helps to have an erection when using the  massager  but it isn t completely necessary  Have you had a look into the TOMAX procedure It is a procedure which could restore sensitivity in the glans clitoris and vagina  depending on gender  It is a neurological bypass which could help people with SCI lower than T12 if I remember correctly  How exactly do you use the Hitachi to assist in ejaculating and or reaching orgasm DM if you prefer   C4 C5 incomplete Thanks a lot for the info I will look into it I am going to look for helpful drugs first though before going the toy route op is c5 6When did you accept that you would be a permanent wheelchair user Or do you still not accept it I blacked out for about a minute when I suffered my SCI and when I woke up I knew I was paralyzed within 3 seconds I was heavily sedated for 3 days and when I came to was very foggy I don t remember anyone telling me I was I paralyzed or that I was not likely to walk again but I m sure it happened and I must have immediately accepted it and started looking for  what s next then   A few months for sure   When I first got home I was on the computer looking for studies and  cures  and the like I am just past a year now and as nice as it would be if this never happened I don t care about being in a chair for good  I was a child when injured and kids don t question things like adults do For the first few months I thought everything would simply go back to normal any day now But then I just stopped thinking about it I guess A lot of my family were very determined that I d walk again and were all about the stem cells but thankfully they stopped mentioning it after about a year It was really holding me back and had I been old enough to speak up for myself I d have told them so   I d not have been able to move on and build a life if focused on some kind of cure I ve personally found it beneficial to work with what I ve got rather than what could be I ve had zero recovery since 1997 so it s just as well I took that stance really  I ve accepted it I still don t like it   There s nothing I can change about it  I m complete too  So much research for a  cure  doesn t apply to me  most recovery stories are for the lucky incompletes or for the newly injured I m coming up on 7 years     I still get fucking bummed often  like cried today about missing my running workouts  but I try to live the best life I can from a chair  It s fucking hard but I m doing it every day so I m proud of myself  The day that you tell yourself you re going to be in a wheelchair permanently is the day that you re chances of walking again go out the window The only thing that we have to accept is that our lives have changed and we have an uphill battle to fight With faith hope and determination I know that I will walk again  I didn t really have a choice  I was injured at 6 months old so my chair is all I ve ever known   I mean I could use braces and crutches all the time but that is too fricking difficult    p I always hold on to the hope that I will regain everything but I don t expect I will This last year  injury 2014  has been the first one were I actually can enjoy today and am not just trying to get to tomorrow I had spent a year down for a never ending pressure sore Since getting out July 2018 things have been good My injury still intrudes into my life more than I like but it s not all I think about like before  as soon as I opened my eyes and couldn t feel my legs I remember telling my ex girlfriend  I m paralyzed but it s all gonna be okay  as I got carried to the ambulance in a stretcher  I had no idea what paralyzed besides not being able to walk  but nobody had to tell me I was never gonna walk again  I accepted it intellectually long before I did emotionally   So my leison was nontraumatic No big accident no life changing moment just one day in 2015 I woke up and couldn t move my limbs After some time I regained function but it slowly declined over about 5 years and as of now I ve been in the chair for about a year I had intellectually accepted that I was going to be using a wheelchair permanently for a long time Then they finally got a clear image of the lesion   something which had been eluding them due to its position   and it hit me emotinally that fuck this was my life now   That was maybe a month ago after a year of using the chair I hadn t figured out that I was still kinda holding out hope that somehow nothing would be found and the assumed spinal lesion wouldn t be there But it is and it wont go away It might get worse we don t know I m still going through the emotional work there   But because I know that it ll never go away   and its unlikely I m ever going to learn my way out I ve deliberately got myself involved in positive things Wheelchair basketball adapted workout   I like who I am and that includes my use of the chair I just gotta learn how to feel that and not just know it  Within my line of work  placement  I know people who started neuromuscular rehab a few years ago in a wheelchair and now they are walking  It all depends on your SCI level of completeness Anyone interested in Spinal Recovery Research of the Non invasive kind Hi Johnny I m confused as to what exactly you are asking Is it to help research for a non invasive cure Would we be reading through articles and sending you what we think is pertinent Can you be more specific please thanks I have a technical background MechE and I m interested  I am a t6 incomplete for 31yrs I don t think there is help for me but I am interested  I have a very strong feeling anything you post on this sub will not be censored   Hi Johnny  You can call me skeptical don t have much to offer but i m interested   I m a T3 Incomplete of 10 years and may be able to help if it was clearer what you actually want  Hi Johnny  Sent you a pm Thank you very much for your comments For now I ve just put something out there to see what the response would be     My shared goal       Recover from Spinal Cord Injury faster with accessible technologies Non reliant on corporate identities a D I Y approach which can stay conceptual until someone has the balls to try it Or a safer way in directing research being conducted into areas that we want Some of the research is tampered with as it gets funded by for profit organizations so be wary that it s a minefield     Personally   I wanted to make a lot of money so I could direct my own team and not be limited financially Because I would trade it all to move again But seeming as I missed several opportunities to become a millionaire at the age of 17 I might waste the rest of my days trying to take the shortcuts Already 24 and decided to stop waiting for someone else to come up with the answer to recovering from SCI and do my best to contribute   I will continue to try and be in a better financial situation using events and competition Podcasting as well to distribute accelerate research via a wider audience but that takes flipping ages to do even one video And I got about 10 views so not really doing amazing right now but I m still smiling   Until then I m willing to try and do it without money and make the right connection using text which is faster Maybe the answer is right in front of us So I will share the backbone of my podcast topics ahead of time because I m too slow on my own to get the info out since every topic needs in depth research     x200B     How can you contribute      I came across a lot of pre existing research that gets lost because there s nobody to read it understand it So I could compile a list of areas from my findings online and IRL They could possibly be beneficial but need more looking into Then its fine for additional input and tangents of where you guys want to go   Mostly right now since the brain produces electrical current which triggers nerves That has got me mostly into that area of recovery Obviously some people have pacemakers etc and will have to avoid that kind of thing There are other options that could be used too as well that aren t too invasive   Since there are many different variations for electrical applications it takes a large part of the topic At this point I m thinking some kind of collaboration document where I could list different areas of research take input and then allocate topics to individuals   Sites like researchgate com  academia edu  https   academia edu  and some non official papers from various sources old books alternative websites youtube channels etc   The other part is lists of names of people who have already recovered the methods used and patterns seen linking resolutions together     x200B     Platform ideas     As for a collaboration platform to do that personally I like graphite docs but it lacks features for a bigger group Maybe it will be Google Docs but I try to avoid using Google Services with the exception of youtube  Any suggestions welcome at the moment I m familiar with google docs so its no problem even if somebody deletes large sections of useful information I can find the older revisions easily   If anybody is still up for can write up my basic topic areas but it might take me a week to do it From there once we have the documentation you can do whatever you want as long with distribution as long as you link back to this reddit post to continue the research process   Any thoughts on that  I m interested but have the same questions Left a long response hope that helps Kind of on the right lines I have shared barely any info on recovery techniques that I wish to pursue yet so there will be skeptics Very nice check out the post above and I m up for any information on the best way to collaborate It will mix logic science and the unknown together I know there are people spending their lives searching for an answer or part of it so be great to have a good pair of eyes to look at complex topics I have to disagree that the longer the time paralysed the less likely it is to recover That s only in relation to cord trauma and likelihood of how active based rehab will contribute in the beginning The classification of complete incomplete is all wrong and ASIA tests are a very un efficient way of diagnosis as is MRI  There may be potential that you did not know about Understandably being in the situation for 31 years probably heard a lot of BS that didn t work glad to here you are interested That s okay I m already on route to proving it Just will be faster with more input from the rest of the spinal community Contribute how you want Jay that s totally fine Hi Coco I m not very good at writing short snippets of text so there s another essay up there I m listening to see if there is demand for the idea Thanks Ed that s a very motivating PM looking forward to hear your response Cheers Bladder management medicinesOxybutinyn has significant side effects on cognition that are permanent Literally make you crazy with long term use Be very wary  Oxybutunin was pretty much worthless for me Botox was pretty effective but for only about a month and then wore off Why are you not interested in Botox  I use Solifenicin Myrabitiq and Botox Seems like a lot but no side effects and a capacity  in emergencies  of 750 ml  450 to 500 is really good I m also C5 6 but have a very sensitive and spastic bladder It would spasm at  200 and Oxy did not help It also had really bad side effects for me Vesicare too About 6 months ago I tried Botox and it was amazing I hit 475 ml for the first time and can now sleep through the night Yes it wears off after  6 months and is more expensive but it was worth it for me I plan to have botox regularly now   Darifenacin was really good at first but it ended up really drying out my stool  moving that water back to the body bladder  so it was ultimately counterproductive for me  I am a C5 and although it is a bit intrusive I have a suprapubic tube For the most part it works great I wake up in the morning with my overnight bag full to around 2000 mL of urine There s no way that can stay in my bladder overnight The risk for infection is higher with the tube but I have a series of medications that I take which seem to prevent the infections If you have any questions let me know The methenamine I get by prescription is covered by my insurance I might pay a couple bucks Every time I get my urine checked there is always some bacteria in it  Tolerable amounts though If you have a tube you will always have some bacteria But I haven t been hospitalized for an infection or taken anabiotic s in a couple of years  I am very interested and know nothing but desperately need to learn  I opend this or tried to a while back I need to learn how I can do things in public without peeing my pants I wish there was someone near me to talk to to figure stuff out I just got pelvic floor botox for this  It s said it may take 2 weeks to kick into gear But appears to have already help a bit Going to urologist in a few weeks I also did some bladder instillations for intercystital Cystitis The instillations were not very helpful  Thanks for your reply When my urologist switched me from Oxybutinyn to Darifenacin she told me the cognitive changes were reversible I m glad I made the switch irregardless The effects are temporary results are varied from what I have read and its very expensive considering effects are temporary Thanks for your reply It helps hey botox user here If you want to have the effect last longer continue using Oxy but on a lower dose this sould help keep the botox effect for longer Thanks for your reply  I am thinking of moving to Solifineacin for now based on the received inputs Which medications are you taking to lower the risk of uti That s great to know the botox thing is helping I am not sure what you mean about bladder instillations and it s purpose Would be great if you could educate on that6 days till surgery 200 miles away from home First major surgery Nervous Good luck     Depending on whether or not you enjoy drugs and such general anesthesia can be kind of fun Also if you are nervous right before be comfortable asking for something for your nerves  valium etc  It is pretty fun trying to stay awake despite the anesthesia I mean you won t really win against it but these are games I ve played Anyways best of luck  I m not located to far outside of Boston lmk if there s anything you need during your stay I ve been in your situation a bunch of times and am a c4 quadriplegic so I have an idea of what you re going through  lmk if I can help    I think you ll do best trying to not be nervous I know that s not easy but try using the law of attraction and imagine yourself waking up and feeling great and being totally relieved It helps me the whole thinking positive thing It s scary but it will probably be over quicker than you think Good luck     x200B   ps I recommend bringing some lip balm the hospital can be very drying  deleted  My best wishes to you Hope everything goes well  Staying overnight at a hospital can be daunting but there are nurses there to help It s also a good idea to have someone you can call or something you can do to pass the time while you re there  My spinal cord has been detethered 5 times throughout my life  the most recent being treated by a laminectomy You have every right to feel nervous and let your doctor know any concerns and or trepidations They can help reassure you Feel free to dm me with any questions or more information   deleted  How are you doing How did surgery go  Thank you for your fun outlook on hospital drugs I asked for anxiety meds at my last surgery and they told me they will make me feel like I had one too many drinks It was great and kinda fun I hope they will also do the same for this surgery It definitely helped make the process a lot less scary I always ask if they can give me the medaziline early just so I can trip out for a bit before they put me underHey thanks so much for your hospitality Hoping things go well without a hitch   Thank you I hope for the same And I hope to get the insurance approval needed for a better fitting wheelchair too Thank you for your wishes   Thankfully my fianc  will be coming with me and I m told I ll have a private room I m very thankful for both of these things 5 times   Jesus So the laminectomy is they are removing the facet bones of my spine right Did the laminectomy finally keep you detethered In my personal situation my cyst is 12cm in length and has caused almost full erosion in my sacrum I use a wheelchair 75  of the time and definitely for most everything out of the house I don t expect recovery in my case because of the damage They aren t doing anything for the structural damage in my case Just the cystic pressure further damage    I m glad to hear your surgeries were rather successful I wish you as good of health as possible   Turns out I had a badly tethered cord too So surgery took a few hours longer than expected First day and night was really tough because they were still adjusting my pain med cocktail   Spasms are worse after surgery than before but I m on some Valium for it and they are sending me home with some too   If my heart rate can stay in the normal range I m headed home today   Advice on dealing with significant pain year after spinal injury Maybe one of the rods has shifted  I take baclofen and neurontin for help with pain I suggest you find a physical medicine rehabilitation doctor to figure out what combination may work for you  I also walk with a cane and 14 years after my injury suddenly started having strong tailbone pain as well My understanding is that it is because of high resting tone in the pelvic floor muscles which attach to the tailbone So when it is under pressure from sitting it is pulling on a bunch of tight muscle The intervention that has worked best for me is finding and making cushions that take the pressure off my tailbone  Your hardware could have come loose or you might need PT or medication adjustment Best get yourself to a physiatrist also know as PM R doctor Make note of when the pain occurs like every time you sit down or just certain positions or times of day I hope they can get you sorted out quickly Chronic pain sucks   I think you need to talk to your surgeon For many people the rods can be removed after the fusion has solidified and usually relieves a lot of pain  What you re going through sounds pretty severe I would seek out a doctor s opinion and advise  Does baclofen have other uses aside from reducing spasticity Thanks I actually take both of those too but they don t seem to be helping this type of pain Rather than nerve pain I think it s something different going on Thanks I did have a physiatrist when I was in spinal rehab I will contact her about the pain to get her opinion She may have more input than my family dr I love science Unfortunately most things that work on mice to not work on humans Over 90  don t ever make clinical trials Will be more interested excited when they start doing clinical trials  They ll need to test this on people that are just coming into the ER with an immediate injury  or so it sounds like to me  Just thought it was cool that they re turning attention to this particular phase of SCI I know there s a ton more work required  And sample size and consent will be a problem given the time frame when this needs to be given Who is responsible for your injury Came home Halloween 2010 guy had came in the back deck door and fallen asleep on our couch Neighbors had a party so we were nice about it woke him up said you got the wrong spot He s blacked out and starts screaming that we can t kick him out of his own house He drops my roommate another kid gets him on the front porch beating him bloody I pull that kid off and the intruder dives at us all 3 go through the balcony 23 feet up T12 L2 incomplete but bowel bladder program I hope that kid dies and I sued him for every penny he had including future earnings Also sued the apartment company because the railing was broken and had a work order in they never fixed The shock wears off but it fucking sucks still I m going to Vegas next weekend and all I m worried about is where I m gonna go to the bathroom and getting a UTI  A doctor   I don t blame him   Nobody is perfect  People make mistakes   It isn t like he was trying to injure me  He was doing the best he could  My then fiance feel asleep at the wheel and crashed our truck 19 years ago  He walked away without a scratch me with a T 9 complete 3 broken ribs and a punctured lung   I ve never felt much anger towards him  We were very much in love connected at the hip really so it was like this happened to  us  you know  He was at my side in ICU holding my hand as I woke up from surgery by my side as I completed rehab  He was with me when I cried helped me explore sexually in my new body made me feel attractive again    We stayed together for 4 years after the accident  Many things contributed to our break up  relationship was 7 years total   We were so young when it happened   me 22 him barely 21  It s such a huge traumatic heavy thing to expect people so young to deal with    He s married now to an able bodied woman with a very similar personality to mine  he married her in the exact spot he and I had planned to marry at    the elementary school he and I both attended  she did not    that  made me feel anger and hurt  Felt like he exchanged his life with me for a normal one like a reset  He doesn t talk to me anymore his wife was very cold to me the one time I met her  he wouldn t even accept my Facebook friend request  We still live probably 15 20 min away from each other    I m not really angry about the accident because it was just that    an accident  He didn t mean to do it  I do have anger however at being kind of abandoned and at what I see as his self centered actions afterwards   Those  are not accidents   I don t believe that we have to rid ourselves completely of our scars of anger and hurt to have a decent life  Sometimes you just have to carry that shit with you and accept that things happen that are out of your control and people also react in ways that are out of your control    So how long are you going to let it run your life and dominate your thinking  How many years can you keep up this level of bitterness  It been almost 20 years since my accident  How long do you expect me to stoke the fire of resentment      If you are continuously occupied with thoughts of fury and resentment you need therapy  I m not trying to be an asshole I mean this honestly  Learn how to deal with what happened before you become a miserable shit who no one wants to be around  I m sorry that happened to you   How long has is been In my experience it does get better yes it still sucks some days but some days I don t even think about it  The more I do and experience the richer my life gets even if it s in a wheelchair   I was hit straight on the head by a front tire of a motorbike after I laid mine down trying to avoid him he was in my lane passing cars  This was in a foreign country with no liability laws to speak of so nothing happened to him    I don t hold ill will towards him my wife might but shit happens in life that we can t control  And it happened so to me it serves no purpose holding onto to thoughts that can t change or help the situation  I focus on what I can do like waking up and living another day   I know not everyone feels that way some people feel like they would be better off if they had died but I have seen and met so many people with good fulfilling lives that I know it s possible and attitude and outlook have a major impact on one s wellbeing  I was in a plane crash on my first day working for this company They had a less than stellar maintenance reputation but I had flown some of there flight school planes before and had no issues so I thought that was a bit overblown for giggles by the rich kids at the very wealthy flight school with near perfect airplanes based out of the same airport   Turns out there was a big difference between their flight school planes and their work planes causing a crash on takeoff giving both me and my copilot SCI s Then they IMMEDIATELY call all of their other pilots and say that it was just pilot error not their fault despite there being no report out to back them up They just threw us under the bus to get their pilots to stay They were already having trouble getting them to stay due to their poor maintenance I didn t know that at the time though   Flying has been our dream since we were kids and some company just completely ruined that by having poor maintenance and making a dumb mistake that should have never happened   Within 2 years of my accident they had two more accidents incidents One was a landing gear failure causing them to belly land on the runway where the pilots walked away totally fine and the plane was repaired and flying again within 3 months The second accident resulted in the 23 year old pilot s death That one on paper seems pilot error though but my copilot and I believe the company may have pressured him into flying over the mountains at night in bad weather which is a HUGE no no in anything that s not a jet   3 years later and the company apparently isn t doing too great they ve supposedly lost one of their biggest clients and now have a lot of planes just sitting on the ground So looks like karma may be starting to swing back around But it will never be enough My copilot s flight career is done mine is still in question but it s a 50 50 at best And all because some guy I ve never even met making a dumb mistake that caused the plane to be overweight without any way of us knowing   Some days are easier than others to accept I ve not forgiven them and I likely never will But I don t hold a big angry burning hatred towards them anymore I try to give myself the mentality of  being angry won t change anything so why use the energy to do it   bc that s true and does help to accept that You never need to forgive them I certainly won t But I don t need to always have a raging hatred of them either that s going to do so much more harm to you than you realize It s so much harder to move forward with your life if you re still carrying that hatred But that takes time and is much easier said than done I still have days when I m just angry or depressed about it all It s not going to be easy but for your own mental sake it s necessary  No one I won the crap lottery with a spinal cord tumor As a consolation prize it hasn t grown in 35 years nor have the symptoms grown worse   I guess I am lucky   Mine was my own fault I was working with a near wild horse Working in getting her hooves done I like an idiot who should have known better Stood in front of her To try and calm her She reared up came down on my head nearly breaking my neck What was once my passion Is now a massive fear I ve only ridden a handful of times since On old dead broke horses  I never get to talk about this so thank you for asking OP  My injury was the result of getting hit from behind while I was stopped at a red light it was about 3 30AM so there wasn t anybody else around and the guy barreled towards me down a mile or so of open road without ever bothering to slow down ultimately launching me and my vehicle up onto the opposite sidewalk and nearly through a brick wall  This was all at the tail end of Cinco de Mayo so considering how easily he could have avoided this entire shitshow of a collision I think it s reasonable to assume that he was at least kind of drunk he even admitted to police that he had a few beers earlier that night but that he was entirely sober and only hit me because his phone had gone off and he was momentarily distracted so obviously I was shocked to see the police let him go without any kind of field sobriety tests  Only several months later when my shitty attorney told me that his P I couldn t turn up any assets of any real value and advised me to just sign the release and take the  100k settlement offered by the guy s insurance company  of which I d only ever see  66k anyway  did I start to do my own digging and discovered that he was actually a deputy DA for the state and the whole situation started to make a lot more sense  My attorney still managed to talk me into taking the settlement reassuring me that once this was behind me he would go after my employer for firing me while I was still on disability leave but of course as soon as he had my signature on the required documents he stopped returning my calls and emails so now I m stuck with a lifelong spinal injury with cartoonishly inadequate compensation and I m sure I m barely even a footnote in the guy s story  So I guess to answer your question I generally don t care for this person very much I think it s reasonable to say that I probably dislike him to the same extent that he doesn t give a shit at all and it s a real shame that there aren t even any social consequences for somebody who does this kind of shit or for somebody like your former friend who essentially took nearly everything away from you and your family  Like I don t know this dude personally but it sounds like you were fairly close with the person responsible for your injury and you would think that at least your mutual friends and acquaintances would step in and be like  Look you can t be a part of this anymore especially given how remorseless you ve been ever since   you know what I mean I was a passenger in the car of someone else who crashed and caused my C 5 injury I don t hold resentment towards him Everyone asked me if I do The resentment will only hold you back Don t let it consume you   I m not acting like it s easy either It took years for me to get to a mental place where I even felt slightly normal I was at a birthday party in Argentina where I lived at the time They had these inflatable plastic bubbles that you bump into each other with I ran into another guy and I had the same sensation you get when you get the wind knocked out of you but 100x worse I immediately knew something was seriously wrong I couldn t move anything They pulled me out of the bubble and I could hardly talk I fractured my C5 and have C4 C6 damage to my spinal cord It s been 8 months and I ve had a very fortunate recovery I can walk with an AFO on my left foot and have limited use of my left hand arm   I don t blame that guy I bumped into at all It wasn t his fault I do hold some resentment towards the manufacturer of the balls we were using They re a Chinese company so there isn t any way to have my medical bills paid for nor compensation for how my life has completely changed forever You get inside of a plastic bubble to use them as they re advertised thinking they re safe   Do not let anyone you know use them They re much more dangerous than they appear and there are multiple cases of SCI using the same type of product   I ve found that resentment isn t constructive and you just have to move forward with your life Practice gratitude for the things you do have and what you can still accomplish  My parents   Do I blame them I try not to but hell yeah I m angry So so angry   Now technically I guess yes it was the neurosurgeon who did it but it was an elective surgery at my parents  request   They didn t want to deal with a disabled kid having to accomodate my adaptive equipment thought that it would be best for me  the early 90s were an ableist shitstorm  So they went ahead and found a neurosurgeon with  a pioneering new surgery  and absolutely butchered the shit out of a four year old s back   Granted I would ve ended up in a chair at least part time either way but I wouldn t be in chronic pain with risks of sudden bladder bowel control loss and syrinxes etc in my spinal cord with an uncertain future  Had a shitty accident on holiday where I broke a vertebrae After surgery the doctor said I would be completely fine One emergency landing later they discover pieces of bone in my spinal cord with a high res catscan Have another surgery in my home country but now I m left with spinal cord injury that could ve been prevented had the first surgeon done even a half decent job It fucking sucked and it probably took me 2 or 3 years to get past it I haven t seen or spoken to that surgeon again and I don t want to I d like to think they cared there but there s a good chance it s just a blip on their memory     That being said watch Murderball One of the people had a similar accident as yours  What a good post OP thank you It s so rare to have a chance to talk about what happened to us with people who might actually have more than a passing curiosity Your story is totally heartbreaking just like so many others in this thread but thank you for sharing   My injury was caused by some self absorbed middle aged woman who couldn t wait seven more seconds to make a left turn in her stupidly big SUV so she pulled out in front of me on my motorcycle I think about her occasionally mostly with animosity as she was under insured and insisted the accident was my fault  despite having the right of way and going under the speed limit  I was even ticketed as I lay unconscious on the pavement but thankfully I have a badass insurance company who didn t see it that way and paid me the totality of my UIM policy which is the only reason I m not consumed by hate for the selfish thoughtless idiot that changed my life forever  My husbands injury was caused by an 18 year wanna be badass  an attempted robbery  he s an incomplete L2 paraplegic I worked grave so I was getting for work at 9pm  I get a call from him to call an ambulance I run to where he is The front of my car is totaled and bullet holes This kid tried to rob my husband for the car n money he had  the kid got 28 years  this happened January 2017  my husband is still mad as fuck about the situation  but come to find out the bullet that shot my husband was meant for me  and I m at a loss  I m a C4 C5 incomplete and I suffered a TBI do to a car accident that I was a passenger in There were six people in the car yet I was the only one that sustained any serious injuries Yes our lives change our physical abilities change but we are still the same person that we were before we got injured   I like to say  I m not going to let my him  the driver  take more from me than he did that day  The calendar is going to continue flipping days regardless of what mood we re in Although your old friend may be putting on a face as if he wasn t affected I don t buy it Call me unrealistic It s the easiest way to cope with causing a tragedy just act as if nothing happened  scapegoat    Try not to waste any more of your time or energy thinking about him or the past You still have a future ahead of you  The person responsible for my injury is Carl English Tyrone Fowler laquitta Skinner and Brion Hollaway All PAE DS2 staff in Granwohr Germany   Carl run me over he hadn t been allowed to go home for 3 days and wasn t legal to be driving the humvee but was under orders from the other 3   Tyrone and Laquitta witnessed in first hand Brion promised me an accident report but when I requested it from m and e global my employer I was sacked within 24 hours and stuck in Germany   They all told lies to solicitors and lawyers to drag out the 3 year rule as I couldn t persue my claim after that Should have been looked after by the base defense act but wasn t Couldn t afford solicitor fees So here I am 5 years later with a messed up spine dead left leg and suffering mental health problems from not working Most days I wish I was dead   I hope that the people who witnessed and were responsible for it all get a terminal illness that gives them a long slow and painful death for causing me years and years to come of pain torture and suffering  I became paralyzed through a gunshot wound I was visiting family in Mexico and a cousin of mine brought his fathers 45 caliber handgun so that he could show it off however what he didn t know was that the safety was off and that it was loaded He then accidentally dropped it and tried to catch it in mid air His instinct was to try and catch it in mid air but by doing so he pulled the trigger  and I dropped to the ground immediately I am t7   t12 complete an have been paralyzed for 13 years now It s been a bit rough at times but it truly could have been a lot worse  C4 C5 incomplete and TBI  I m not your ex so I can t speak for him but he definitely loved you I too was in a relationship when my injury occurred We remained together for 8 months after I sustained my injury We were seniors in high school though so the age plays a factor We are still friends  she was not at fault for my injuries  He may be avoiding a you to refrain from bringing back memories If you were engaged it was clearly a serious relationship Rather than hold any I ll will towards him try to be thankful he didn t leave you after your accident What works for me is avoiding people on social media platforms and deleting their contact information I m sorry that you ve had to go through this You ll find a better man  Kawasaki My injury was caused by an illness and I ve always felt this to be preferable than any kind of event in which I could experience anger towards another or even myself For the first few years I was generally angry at life but that passed  This past September I was getting off the light rail with my girlfriend to go home As luck would have it I was struck by a stray bullet I have have no memory of that day but I came to in the hospital a few days later Ended up being a T2 complete but the severity of it all took a while to hit me I m barely starting to accept who I am now Thankfully my girlfriend has been by my side every step of the way I don t know what I d do without her The thing I hate is that not only was I left permanently injured but she was left traumatized from experiencing the whole ordeal Somehow they managed to find the person who fired the shot and he finally went to trial last week actually The thing that dumbfounded me the most is that it was just some 16 year old kid He tried apologizing to me saying he was trying to shoot someone else and not me Just hearing that made me throw out any possible remorse I had for him out the window He ended up getting nine years at the end of it Do I wish he got more Yes but I m just glad that part of my new life is over and I can start to move on  I was just in Vegas a few weeks ago It s surprisingly wheelchair friendly Lots of old people there so they made plenty of accommodations Biggest concern I learned the hard way is make sure to stay hydrated Jesus Christ dude Fuck No matter what our injuries suck but this story is insaneHoly shit what a crazy story I heard quite a few injury stories during rehab but yours is the most unthinkable and senseless Some drunk asshole changed your life forever and you have to live with the consequences of his shitty choices Hopefully the litigation paid off in some small way   I can walk but still have to do a bowel bladder program  I m going on a business trip next week that most people in my career would kill for but I d honestly rather not even go because all I can think about is how it s going to fuck up my routine That elementary school move was cold like you were just an inconvenience to his plan He knew he was wrong so he ignores contact with you because it s easier than facing himself Life is hard and strange especially with an SCI It sounds like you ve been able to move past the resentment I hope so   I d like to add to this and say that therapy  cognitive behavioral especially  can be very helpful in coming to a place of peace It can teach you how to change your thinking so it is more naturally like this here commenter s thoughts If you don t mind me asking what company My brother is a pilot and complains about the shitty planes all the time Just curious You can PM me if that s more comfortable for you That sounds almost like legal malpractice Internal external rotation of forearm exercises to do in chair I am a c5 complete   You can use a pair of light ankle weights on the wrists for many different types of shoulder exercises I do that and

going to pop off     x200B    I don t know if this is the information that you are looking for but maybe it may give you some ideas to try for his case Let me know if you have any other questions  I might be able to help if you could give me the muscle groups he needs to stretch  Thank you this is so helpful Yes absolutely  His biceps need some stretching  he has tone in his biceps pulling his arms in which doesn t let him strengthen his triceps as much as wanted  and his forearms and triceps need more strengthening I m not sure what muscle it is but the muscle that flips your palm from facing down to facing up needs some strengthening and sometimes stretching because tone can turn them up involuntarily Thank you Starting a podcast Questions How about dating advice My husband is c6 7  when we met I d never even known anyone using a wheelchair before I had lots of questions    Also my husband says how about having a couple of caregivers on  I m a T 4 para and consider myself pretty lucky too I ve been para for 25 years so I can t think of anything I d have to ask But for the purpose of your podcast  I thought it was helpful when I had my kids knowing the options things like making diaper changing stations out of a card table  knees and lap get under table  Or dressing my kidss  when they were crawling  in over alls so I could pick them up by one hand and put them on my lap That might be interesting to new Mothers or peeps considering kids after SCI  hope that helps Good luck  Post Acute Rehab FacilityFinding a good rehab facility is so key I went to Spaulding in Boston and they had great therapists specializing in SCI They even had me picking apples in an apple orchard with a reacher less than two weeks after my SCI for therapeutic recreation  Had a friend

Kids have incredible bodies that can bounce back from many things that would be permanently disabling to an adult   Try to reach out for help whenever possible Ask for people to sit and read to her while you go home and take a shower Ask for meals and gift cards to be brought to the hospital Ask for neighbors to take out your trash cans or mow the lawn Ask for someone to sit with you in the

your family the best  It s a waiting game now  Just trust the doctors and hope for the best  I wish you both good luck and I m sorry your baby is going through this  Transverse myelitis A lot of people affected by it are able to go on to recover some or all function Hope your daughter gets a good outcome Best wishes to your family  It sounds like acute flaccid myelitis If so Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore can help  Thank you all for your comments concerns and help I ll be taking all this advice God bless you all Thank you  I m very sorry to hear this  I have an 18 month old daughter and I can only imagine how terrifying this must be for you  I can only imagine how terrified my parents were when they went through something similar with me  I went through something that sounds a bit like what your daughter is going through when I was 13  One morning I woke up to a bad back ache  It was so painful I remember just wanting to die to end the suffering  My mom thought maybe I had a slipped disc so she told me to go lay down in her bed while she called our neighbor who was a chiropractor  I somehow managed to find a comfortable position and fell asleep  I woke up about a half an hour later and felt considerably better  I got out of bed and tried to go use the bathroom  I couldn t urinate for some reason  I came out of the bathroom to tell my mom and as I did I stumbled and fell to the ground  My mom panicked but I didn t think much of it  She said we were going to the hospital  We lived out in the country and the nearest hospital was 25 miles away  I got loaded into the van in my pajamas and we took off  By the time we got to the hospital I could no longer feel my legs or walk  They brought me in and did some x rays and tests  The doctor there knew they were too small of a hospital to treat me  He had a few good guises as what it could be though  He had them pump me full of steroids and sent me to the city about 120 miles away via ambulance  By the time they got me there I was paralyzed from the chest down  In the ambulance I had started to lose feeling in my hands but fortunately it went down  This all happened in the span of a few hours  The official diagnosis when all was said and done was Transverse Myelitis which is what someone else mentioned  That person mentioned how sometimes it does reverse itself and people have a full recovery  Unfortunately that was not the case for me but that was just me it is true that a lot of people experience some recovery  When I was in the hospital the local news did a segment on me and a lady saw it and came to visit me  She had the same thing and she made a full recovery  I m also not entirely certain mine was Transverse Myelitis  The doctors never expressed much confidence in this diagnosis but didn t seem to know what else to label it    Stay positive like I said I can only imagine the fear you feel but try your best  Be strong for your daughter as that will help them as well  I hope for the best and a full recovery  Get her to Shirley Ryan Ability Lab in Chicago Best in the world I m so sorry this is happening to your family You ll get through it   deleted  Sorry that you and your daughter are going through this it s very frightening My injury was caused by either TM or ADEM two different hospitals two different diagnosis  this was back in 97 when I was 11  The myelin sheath on my spinal cord was affected and that s how my spinal cord got damaged My symptoms were gradual starting with a severe headache and over the course of about 10 days my body just stopped working Unfortunately I didn t receive the appropriate medical attention until I was very very ill and by that point the paralysis was up to my neck Huge doses of steroids and other medicines brought the level of injury down after about two weeks where it has remained at t5 incomplete  My very good friend who I met in hospital experienced the kind of rapid onset of symptoms like you describe she woke up one morning and the next minute she was paralysed Her diagnosis has never been 100  confirmed she either had TM or a spinal stroke  How is your daughter doing now Sorry I don t think I have any advice but thought I d just send over these experiences out of solidarity  Hey LashCanino we now know that is what she has Acute transverse myelitis Can you provide any info at all about a possible experience you ve had with this Thank you so much I think you re onto something This sounds like my exact experience  waist and below  but it turned out to be the disk  L4 and L5 had to go and I had surgery to relieve the pressure that day     I got back movement and some sensation but some of it is permanent   I ve just never read an account so close to what I felt down to trying to use the bathroom and collapsing The back pain was excruciating Thank you for your story They narrowed it down to transverse myelitis It s horrible that more people don t know about this and how violent and quick it is If you don t mind me asking can you describe your recovery how long it took and what you recovered That would help a lot And even more importantly what steps helped you the most and what should we do for her Thank you and God bless I m sorry to hear that happened This whole diagnosis is a bitch and the world needs to be more aware of it Hey my friend Thanks for your reply She has movement in her wrists and shoulders albeit very limited She received the proper treatment within one hour of the very first symptom so we are hopeful that she has the best shot and beating this No movement in the legs or core is a huge reason for concern though How long did you do rehab Best shoes to wear with AFOI m gonna check them out I don t wear AFOs anymore but I m looking

ios_share_flow_optimization utm_term control_2    I ve trained my friends to stop sending me every little piece of junk about spinal this and recovery that that find on the internet     this actually looks promising  Nerve  and tendon  transfers can really improve arm and hand function in patients with tetraplegia Although the donor nerve has to be functional and can be tested as part of surgical planning  Consider discussing nerve and tendon transfer with your SCI physician or reconstructive surgeon   the surgeries are moving towards standard of care now and this is not limited to research  I m glad of course that this stuff is evolving  There s another part of me that finds it emotionally painful after 19 years witnessing each and every tiny step forward  When I was first injured and the hope was fresh for me this kind of stuff excited me a lot more  These days I feel kind of numb to it  I m not trying to say this research doesn t matter or that it s not useful  it s just my personal feelings about it  It s hard to stay hopeful and be so invested in something I have no control over and that moves so incrementally  Anyone know how to see if we qualify and how to go about starting this surgery    this actually looks promising   Unfortunately it sounds like they are doing surgery on patients that had an SCI plus peripheral nerve damage and while the surgery helps improve the recovery from peripheral nerve damage symptoms it does nothing for the spinal cord related symptoms    Compared to central nervous system damage the peripheral nervous system heals almost on its own given enough time   26f broke my neck in several places and would love advice or personal experience on things that make living in a c collar easierI was in a halo for three months after fracturing my C2 a few years ago so I might be able to help First of all if you take your narcotic pain killers exactly as prescribed  or less  you will not become addicted Speaking from experience here But more to the point you just need to find ways to take your mind off it For me I lived for my PT sessions Exercise after a serious injury heals not only the body but the mind as well As corny as it sounds getting those endorphins going will help stave off depression at this very vulnerable point of your life   Perhaps even more importantly than that is you need to find a way to sleep Try propping your upper body up or strategically placing pillows to get back to your pre injury favorite sleeping position I ended up needing Ambien for the three months I was in that GD halo and I didn t find it to be habit forming in the slightest so you might ask your doc about that if you can t sleep naturally   Exercise sleep and a few hobbies will make your time in that collar much more bearable  No spinal cord injury at all You are lucky All the best in your healing  Go buy a lottery ticket man  When I was younger I never read a book I didn t have to read When I got hurt books helped me take my mind off of things Watching tv was ok but it still let my mind wonder and I found reading to be more mentally captivating I read a few thousand pages in a week I don t even think I d done that in my entire life up until that point  I wore a c collar for 9 weeks after my injury  c2 3 and t4 7 fractures  during the hottest part of summer which was 95  degrees every day here The hardest parts were dealing with the heat and  not  sleeping   Figure out a way to sleep ASAP After a few nights of  4hrs of sleep you will start to get desperate I ended up using a combination of pillows and a wedge to prop myself as well as Advil Tylenol oxy gabapentin flexiril and Benadryl at various points through the night It still didn t work very well so talk to your doctor about options for sleep aids   As for the heat and discomfort change and wash your pads every day and every time you get sweaty so you don t get a rash Make sure you have 1 2 spare sets of pads so you can change them often Cut your hair short if that is an option   You will very likely become dependent on the pain meds since it only takes a week or two Make sure to taper off when you are done and you won t get bad withdrawal  Sleep  Diet and routine do the tedious things you ve always put off Learn a new language sign language coding 3d printing etc It s really easy to gain weight when you can t move your neck back Not that you would my experience was almost 2 months and 15 pounds  abnormal for me  Take care    Edit  when doing PT if you re a competitive person like I was DO NOT PUSH THROUGH THE PAIN Only go as far as you do not feel any pain Do NOT over work That area will take years to heal and it s never going to be the same You ll likely get tension migraines later from soft tissue damage Don t worry PT helps get rid of those but you MUST maintain the muscle strength You ll have neck exercises to do daily Your body will never be the same you have to make a few lifestyle changes   P S I apologize if this is too much info up front I personally did not take any of the narcotics meds I used the PAIN as a barometer of how my body was healing Pain will tell you a LOT of info Even a week of meds will throw off your natural  feel  for healing  Understand that this is now an adaptation process It ll help  Thank you so much I m a very active person who s used to going to the gym 5 or 6 times a week so transitioning to laying in bed is tough I ll hopefully get PT sessions at my next appointment and that should help a big bunch Sleeping is definitely rough as I m a tummy sleeper so I ll for sure bring up Ambien Yeah I was incredibly lucky Was swimming with a nurse and a3rd year med student and they very quickly got me out of the water and stabilized I still haven t really processed how lucky I gotLolol naw already gotta worry about getting addicted to opioids don t wanna develop a gambling addiction too  Wonderful I have a few audiobook but I ll definitely check out more from overdrive ThanksYeah that s proving harder than I expected but I m sleeping as much as possible  Yeah right now I ve lost to much weight I have basically no appetite So I started tracking in MyFitnessPal to make sure I was getting all da nutrients I need  Luckily I just discovered I can chew Cheeto puffs without pain so that s helping Should I use a cane Yes is the short answer It helps with balance prevents falls and also has the added benefit of showing people that you aren t 100  stable Ie if you go shopping people give you a wider berth and aren t as likely to knock you as they pass closely  I actually use a elbow crutch now for added stability  I have to use both if going a longer distance or uneven ground  Regardless of whether or not you actually need one you GOTTA sport that Pimp Cane  You have an opportunity to use a pump cane and have a legit reason  No one could question your use of the cane  Hell yeah   Go to a physical therapist and let a professional who does it for a living be the judge of what kind of assistive device you need if any  Too many people give themselves even more problems by self prescribing devices and either getting wrong type wrong size or using it incorrectly  The short answer is yes at least a cane   The long answer is you should consult with a physical therapist who can make sure you re using it properly  i e for R side weakness you hold it in your left hand  and other fun tips   make sure it s appropriately sized help with strengthening  pre surgical PT leads to improved outcomes  we call it  pre hab   and ensure it s the appropriate device for you    if I put my weight on it I ll fall   Do everything you can to keep yourself from falling SCIs suck but SCI plus a broken hip sucks noticably more  Good point just didn t know if it would make me seem attention seeking or like I m making a bigger deal out of it or something like that Thanks I m gonna try too but the doctor and test are expensive as is for right now so it s just difficult to get to a physical therapistAnd there s always the double SCI Voice Control in iOS 13   I tried this over the last 24 hrs in beta and it s so powerful Looks amazing Been using the beta as well works so well  Can t wait to try it Dragon Naturally Speaking used to have a Mac version but it was never as robust as the PC version and it mysteriously became unavailable unsupported several months ago I kind of wonder if Apple had anything to do with that Either way if it comes baked into the software and is as good as the promo looks it ll be a big deal  pretty impressive  If it works as well as the video makes it seem this is going to be HUGE I seriously hope that it s a lot more intuitive than Siri  Siri sucks  But it s actually as good as the commercial Nothing to do with Apple dragon just canceled the Mac version Couldn t agree more I didn t touch Siri sinceIncontinence issueOne time I I tested positive for a uti and they gave me some antibiotics for it Well a few days later I realize that I m not getting better like I normally do Turns out the bacteria was resistant to the meds so they put me on another kind Cleared right up  I can t tell if you re a man or woman from your post but what about a yeast infection or vaginitis  Yeast infection would work for a man too though Also I had some incontinence issues once and it turned out my urethra was infected I tested negative for a UTI  Back when I was on opiates I d get backed up enough to where my bladder couldn t fill up all the way Did your doc do a urine culture  not dipping with a UA strip but collecting a sample to send to the lab  first to check what bacteria is causing the infection before you took antibiotics It s possible it was caused by a bug your Sulfa drug doesn t treat so they ll need to try something different Try to go back to the same doc or health system to ask for further treatment so that they can check the results of the urine culture for antibiotic sensitivities if it was done It could also definitely be a resistant bug to the drug you were prescribed   A rash or some discharge It s called jock itch for men  In one of your other posts you mentioned pushing yourself to cath every 6 hours Is it possible that you ve irritated your bladder by waiting too long I have heard other people say that if they wait too long in between caths they overfill and leak   Maybe look into Botox  Have you had uro dynamics recently Maybe botox could be an option for you if there s not something else going on like uti stones etc  I m a man how would I know if it was a yeast infection iOS users this might be of

you use for assistive devices  What were your coping techniques at 16 How did you deal with the  unfairness  of it all and the thought that you would live the rest of your life this way Are you spiritual  That s pretty inspirational chat right there mate Good for you The ability to change your perspective is a power tool if the head box that most people never learn to use  I read a book called the chimp paradox which helped me allot post injury  c5 incomplete 6yrs   Good luck becoming iron man   do ya have many real friends and not just doctors or people who feeel sorry for ya Me  I am a T6 have only a couple of people I d call friends  Really lonely lately  just work and bed  work and bed  I am still learning things I should know after 31yrs   thank you When I learned that I can live a full life I estimated that I have a solid 40  years left if everything goes well So why not use that time to accomplish something that might change my future  I m also a c6 c7 incomplete quad and was injured at 16 What are you studying in school Do you live on campus  Same here bro u give me hope cuz I m definitely losing it I tell everyone not being able to walk is the easy part I m tired of dealing with the physical pain let alone the mental   emotional Do u deal with cold sweats for hours   a time They drain the life out of me I swear I have this pressure ulcer currently so I ve mostly in the bed on my side any advice on the healing process cuz I don t think it s getting better I was very unlucky I end up having a hole in my esophagus and had multiple infections and pressure ulcer because I was in a coma for almost 3 months with a halo  I end up spending about three years in the hospital from having to have multiple surgeries to fix my esophagus  Even though I ve been injured for five years but I ve only been home the past 2 years Since I ve been discharge I started school and that pretty much keep me busyAt home I have an Alexa automated door locks automated lights  At school I prefer using the Notes app on the iPad with voice to text to write papers  For notetaking I use an app called notability on the iPad It s really useful because not only does it record the lectures but you can also write down notes and it will highlight as the recording goes so when you go back if you don t understand something you wrote you can use the recording for reference Well it was really confusing because I didn t understand the extent of the injury But I am all right with it now one of the things that help me cope was being on a pediatric floor I saw a lot of younger kids that had brain injuries and basically Were just there with no function that made me feel less pity towards myself I am spiritual but I also believe that we have some control of our own destiny Which is why I m in school to become a biomedical engineer hopefully going to research My plan B is to make a Iron Man suitI definitely have fewer friends but the ones I have im really close with  I help run a discord group and I consider some of the people on there as real friends compared to Some friends I see daily But I definitely understand what you mean sometimes it feels like it s just you against the world but try to keep yourself busy The constant pain and discomfort are something that I have adjusted my mind to get used to just try to keep your mind busy for example now I started coding a lot when I first got injured i had halo And was in a coma for a couple of weeks and I end up with three pressure ulcers so I know the struggle right now I m dealing with a heel ulcer that I got from my terrible leg spasms Thankfully I am not on bed rest But Aquaphor and coconut oil is your friend I literately cover myself with aquaphor each night before bedHow did you meet your SO I met my girlfriend 5 years post injury We sat next to each other in class and we started hanging out At 5 years post injury I was still fairly apprehensive about being in a relationship at that point so I didn t actively pursue a relationship it just kind of blossomed out of friendship She was able to see me for me and i was able to See her for her We ve known each other for about 6 years together for 5   Now for some hard truths  dating in a chair is not all that different than the way you used to date If you are not ready to date that is fine but people can pick up on that If you ARE ready to date however you have an advantage People are naturally attracted to confidence and if you put yourself out there in your chair showing people you are not afraid of who you are that goes a long long way   I think that s the main take away when it comes to dating having a relationship when you have a disability   you will attract people regardless   but only if you are ready and if you are yourself Don t try to compensate for your disability it truly does not matter in the long run  People are looking for a connection and when they you find it that s what endures   I m not sure if this answers your question at all but this has been my experience  Met my wife when I was working First time we met I was with a different lady and she was with her ex Five years later we we re both single and so gave it go Now we have been married three years and have a two year old and one on the way   I am forty now and been a paraplegic for 22 years Early on I dated a lot with girls I met at bars or online I found that if you are a positive out going dude in a chair that women found that attractive I did better than my peers at hooking up Also once I got past the whole intercourse is only a part of sex and there are many things I can do still then I was much more confident with myself and had quite a bit of success  I met my first bf after my SCI in college We lived in the same dorm Then we broke up a few years later I met my husband using OkCupid but that was some years ago I didn t put any pictures of me in my wheelchair on my profile because there are surprisingly a lot guys out there with fetishes for women in chairs and I didn t like getting messages from them I did let him know I used a wheelchair during the process for setting up our first date so that he could back out if he was a jerk and there weren t any big surprises Our first date was to a farmer s market Since sports leagues aren t the most accessible is there another activity you could do to meet new people like volunteering playing board games a book club meetup events political activism cooking classes  or other classes  etc   im 20 and was in a similar situation to you i met my gf on tinder and we just hit it off really well i got injured at 18 and im a c5 complete quad shes actually the best looking girl ive ever been with maybe i just really lucky but theres someone out there for everyone dont lose hope  If you re on Instagram I recommend checking out some of  wheels2walking posts and stories The most recent ones are dating tips and how he met his current SO at the gym All the best  Met my girlfriend off bumble Even with the wheelchair I found that as long as you re a decent human being most girls won t really care about it Be very up front if you use online apps about your chair cause it ll clear away the people who judge you by the chair Tinder was successful for hookups for me while bumble was more in the serious dating side   my SO is the one in the chair but I imagine he would tell the story pretty similarly   I saw him at the front of the theatre in our first lecture of our uni degree and referred to him as  cute wheelchair boy  to my flat mates for about 3 weeks until I came across his name on a seminar sheet I added him on Facebook we met up in the library to work and were official within two months  and it s now been 2 5 years   I never dated pre SCI so all of my experience was post  Don t worry about it be yourself and relax  As others have mentioned women especially ones that are worth dating don t really seem to care about the chair as long as you re a decent dude  I met girls in the Union on campus back in college  I dated a girl who worked at the place I bought catheters from  Dated a girl who showed up with a friend at a house party I was throwing  I ve had one night stands with girls I ve met at the bar  Girls I ve met online  The point is dating post SCI isn t really different than dating without one  I m a pretty average looking dude who could stand to lose a little weight  Even with that being the case I have dated or slept with my fair share of amazing and beautiful women  Each one was a great experience  None were ever bothered by my disability or wheelchair  I ve now been with the same girl for almost 5 years  We re engaged and have a child  It s great  I met my boyfriend through Match com post injury   It can definitely be a challenge  Multiple times there was mutual interest only to find later they didn t read my full profile and were  surprised  by my chair  I am very upfront and honest on my profiles about the chair I don t care to waste either of our time   However just keep in mind  Your chair Is a built in asshole filter  I met my boyfriend with spina bifida at sled hockey practice  We ve been dating 8 months now and I love him    I m 20 paralyzed since I was 16 I had a bf at that time but we broke up shortly after I got home  not because of my disability btw  I m not in a relationship right now but the last guy I dated was someone that I had worked with Last summer I worked at a summer camp for disabled kids and most of the counselors were also disabled and dating another disabled guy made things a lot simpler Even though he s not paralyzed or a wheelchair user he was much more understanding   I think I m a pretty ok looking guy and I put some effort into my appearance  I dress ok and exercise and stuff  I have had a couple of girls hit on me wheelchair and all which was encouraging I m having a hard time finding someone to date right now because I m also gay So finding other guys my age who like guys and are open to dating a quad is pretty hard What do you think about online dating so far I ve never done it but I ve thought about trying it It just seems so awkward so I ve been nervous to try  I randomly stumbled on her page on Instagram and added her Started talking a couple months later after I slid into her DMs and then a couple months after that I moved 500 miles to live in an apartment with her I met my husband 13 years after I became injured We met on OkCupid and have been together 6 years married 3 years  I became paralyzed at the age of 13 and I m now 26 years old I met my significant other last year through the app bumble The advice I d give is just be confident in yourself and always be yourself That s one major thing my significant other loves about me my self confidence Best of luck  Go for it Think of online dating as a way to set up in person dates the same way you might bump into someone IRL and chat for a bit and decide to meet up again You don t have to have long drawn out convos typing back and forth I know Grindr is always mentioned for gay guys but there are others Surfer s MyelopathyWow I ve never heard of this before I m looking into it now Are you in the hospital in Thailand or at home I wish you all the best in your recovery     Edit  Here s a good explanation    The mechanism of the injury is actually quite obvious and it s surprising that it doesn t happen more frequently Hyperextension of the untrained back results in a cutting off of the blood flow to the spine depriving the spinal cord of oxygen This causes a  stroke  of the spinal cord typically resulting in some level of paralysis  Hi guys I finally receive my MRI and CT scanning But i am still waiting the discussion and conclusion of neurologists I guess my case is a serious one because i still do not show any improvement in getting back the power and sensation Actually i start feeling a sense of current inside my legs about a week before and it continues even without the electric treatment of physical therapist Is this a good phenomenon But i still cannot move my legs a bit Honestly i am a impatient person i really want to recover as soon as possible Thus i truly want to find someone who can share his recovery experience with me    Digital stimulation  for excretion  I am sorry to hear of your condition and hope you fully recover soon  http   carecure rutgers edu forum  There was someone with this when I was in rehab She recovered slowly However that doesn t mean you will Talk to the doctors and see what they say  I am now in the hospital of my home Thank you for your explanation caring and kindness So let me guess  Is that the recovery of spinal cord injuries count on the recovery system of each person It differentiate the recovery period of patients Thank you so much I will take a look at it Omg is she exactly got Surfer s Myelopathy I really want to contact her and have a glimpse on her path of recovery Haha I will probably receive my MRI and CT scan report to find out the extent of injury Anyway thanks a lot  survey I just use skate shoes because they have good grip works pretty good done Before you go into that nice idea  I use velcro strips on my shoes and that is really efficient unless shoes go in the washing machine  very cool  I ve done the same but I ve gone one better I ve stuck grip tape on my foot plates Severally depressed newly disabled 21 year oldFirst off if I can give any kind of advice for the situation you re in now I d say to send your post to any charities organisations specialised institutions in your country  in the UK there is the SIA Backup trust Forward Salisbury spinal centre Stoke Mandeville etc   as they are set up exactly to guide people with similar issues My past self considered any solution as some massive mountain to climb but getting the ball rolling is a lot easier than it seems I promise you     Every injury and response to an injury is very different so my experience may not relate completely but hopefully it s useful I ll try to condense it as best as possible and will elaborate on whatever you want to know     x200B   I had an accident aged 18 rendering me paraplegic was in hospital for 9 months and barely left the house until I was 26  I would go for months at a time without going outside   couldn t stand people looking at me felt extremely uncomfortable being in a chair  Right after the injury I did some voluntary work for a disabled home helping people with using computers for an hour a week but had so many issues with pressure sores UTIs pain etc that I was often bed bound and gave up     x200B   After a couple of years I attended a nearby college to do Illustration  my mother drove me it was about 5 mins away  but again health and self esteem issues caused me to drop out  I had to get drunk every morning to show up not recommended  and I pretty much festered at home for several years like a hermit and barely even spoke to my parents Around the age of 24 I was beyond lost and miserable and so decided to spend one year committed just to solving the basic things  sleeping properly eating properly and doing some kind of basic exercise  all things I could do without leaving the house  They were all really important things that people gloss over but if you re depressed and dealing with physical issues they can make everything so much worse  I was eating badly up all night sleeping all day etc      When I was 26 I decided I wanted to study Neuroscience to at least feel I m learning about my injury and get a grasp of what avenues are available   but also to have a goal and feel I m actually accomplishing something I had not done any science A levels so bought a biology textbook contacted my old school about sitting the exam there and ended up getting accepted into a university Now I m 30 going into my masters in September with the aim to go into SCI research Of course this all came with its own problems that I m happy to elaborate on and I m certainly not saying you need to do this but I just want to highlight how much it helped me coming up with a direction goal  which I know is difficult enough to find without an injury  and breaking it down into small digestible steps     x200B   If there is something specific you want to do there will be a way for you to do it in some capacity and enjoy life considerably more than you re doing now For every problem you have there will be some kind of a solution out there Many are imperfect but they will make your life better It seems many on here have issues with family but forums like this are really helpful for the solidarity that families may not be able to provide     x200B   There are lots of things that can help support the direction you want to go in You need to be a little savvier about approaching them than the average person and yes things can take a little more effort and courage than they used to but they are possible It will probably be a long while before you recognise it but even though you probably feel very weak helpless and miserable all of the time I promise you are getting mentally stronger  I hope this hasn t all seemed too rambly I m not the best writer but if you have any question at all I will be happy to answer Don t think of anything as too small or embarrassing to ask If it s a problem for you then it s a problem and there will be a way to alleviate it  I just want you to know that you re not alone  Many people with SCI go through periods especially in the early years when they feel lonely isolated depressed and obstacles seem too high to overcome  I totally understand the feeling of being overwhelmed with all the things you have to do to learn and not having people around you that understand what you re going through    As far as your grandparents go and how they feel about you moving forward I suspect that they are being overprotective and are worried  They may not understand that you need to move on in order to get better  Just know that what you do with your life is  your  decision to make not theirs  Do you have paratransit in your area  You may want to look it up and try to get the process going to sign up with them  You need to start taking control  If you PM me what country state you are in I can start looking up resources for you   Here s how I live on my own  I use paratransit  I have housing assistance  Section 8 housing voucher from HUD   I have a college degree with help from Vocational Rehab which paid for everything  I used to work part time keeping my paychecks under the amount that would affect my benefits  I have an ABLE account which allows you to save money without it affecting your benefits  The place where I see my therapist for depression and anxiety has a special assistance program for low income people   You re going to have to start signing up for lots of programs which mean LOTS of paperwork  It can be overwhelming  I suggest looking for the closest Center for Independent Living  in the US if that s where you are  and asking them to help you   You can do this  It s going to be an uphill climb you may get frustrated and it may take a while but you can do it  You have to get stubborn  Keep us updated  If you want to come over there is a few of us on the discord server    https   discord gg XeVCRy What area of the country are you located in   What would your academic or occupational interests be in   Sorry I was just curious I m sorry you re in this situation     Contact any outreach you can Show them this post and move out if you can Being by yourself is hurting you and you can move on once you see past the shit and see that life is still there Get professional help  If you are in the US your state should have a vocational rehabilitation group They can help you go to college and get a job The best jobs for people with SCI often use computers and a college degree is really helpful When you say you are paralyzed from the chest down do you mean that you have use of your arms and fingers or that you don t The types of adaptive equipment and software are different depending on the use of your hands you have available to you but its possible to have a job and a life in either case You might have to plan to do things at a slower pace if your health is unstable but you can get there Also do you regularly see a physiatrist and a mental health councilor of some kind If not you should  This community sub is full of people who have great tips and a wealth experience to share Even if you use it for a place to vent your emotions please feel free to reach out whenever We are here for you  Hey there Im 24 now and almost 4 years post injury  T7  so I know how you feel The worst of it for me was the beginning Coming to the realization of my situation that I will probably be in a wheelchair my whole life But after I was out of all of my braces and casts and things I started to feel less shitty about my situation it does get better but you really have to keep a good attitude about it I know you think your life is over but its not at all Just a change in your life you have to deal with   3 things really helped me see the upside of life and maybe they can help you too  1 I started listening to music everyday If music is something you like do that That helped me a TON I like music ALOT so it was easy for me   2 Try some new activities you can think of to try to take your mind off of things Try to find a hobby or something you can do that makes you happy  3  Try to find some friends or someone to hang out with Or even some friends online in your situation  like on here   Being alone with just your thoughts can take a toll on you mentally   Keep your head up Life is pretty ok    I m late to the party   I recommend that you find something to do I am part of a disabled sailing group the volunteers there are amazing All they ask is what can I do to help I try to be involved with fund raising and everythinng it s a great social outlet too   I also go to the  ICSCI at Kennedy Krieger  https   www kennedykrieger org patient care centers and programs international center for spinal cord injury  for therapy and to my doctor Wonderful program I am treated very well and I don t feel like I do normally because most other people are disabled too I feel bad saying it but when I see someone worse than me I feel better   But they offer more than just therapy and doctor they have a psychologist that specializes in SCI and a support group   I went to Edinboro U of Pennsylvania after high school they have pretty good wheelchair stuff and now I am getting another degree in web design   Moral of the story  you should try to get help You aren t alone Try to get out and meet people with SCI or some disability   PS  I had a brain injury at 12 but I get treated like a SCI patient  Mate trust me shit don t get better I m sorry to say   Everyone will tell you how brave you are and that a cure is not far off Unfortunately that s all bullshit   Life only gets harder as you get older I m 10 years post injury and I had awesome recovery in the first 5 years and I tried to keep positive and continue life as close to it was before but eventually your body just says NO and you fall apart   Shit is worse now I will never be ok with this existence Everything is harder nowhere is easy to go all the things you put off for later you can t do anymore   My advice is get some sleeping pills and try sleep 14hrs a day Train yourself to dream cause that s the only place I get any relief I actually pretend that being awake is the nightmare and when I sleep it s real life   Sorry to be a downer but that is the truth and anyone who gives you the pep talk their life must have already been boring or shitty before the injury Anyone who s life was awesome and then is reduced to this life of pain and disappointment feels the same way  wow this made my day thank you for offering your help  I m so happy to hear that you are doing better I do relate a lot to you I have a lot of issues with siting in my wheelchair It s so uncomfortable I get dizzy and light headed my joints dislocate And after awhile the pain is unbearable to me It s really frustrating but I actually really enjoy being a person and doing things that everyone else does like going to get fucking milk if I need it So even though that it is uncomfortable and it is painful when I m living like a human I don t worry about it as much My grandparents  umm I m sure they re worried genuinely But I feel like I may be kind of neglected in a way  They think I m not ready because I can t stand to be around them  I have ptsd and they re constantly yelling and banging and don t care that I have ptsd They want me to go into a group home They ve told me to call the driver of the vehicle for help  who hasn t helped in 3 yrs  just to throw it in my face and be spiteful There is definitely a generational gap and I don t think that we will ever be able to see eye to eye I have to fight for everything that should be a basic human right Like in every direction in life It s so exhausting I just want to live I m so overwhelmed I don t know where to look for help But I know something in me is changing and I am ready and really really really need out this made my daywow thank you I m going to pm you I live in central Texas I want to be an estheticianThank youThank you I will look into vocational rehab I m paraplegic so I m blessed to still have hand function I used to see a therapist and a psychiatrist but I felt like they didn t understand me either and I just felt discouraged from going Firstly this is not true Secondly this is not helpful I would encourage you to read many of the posts on this RedditHonestly I got pretty good at lucid dreaming but I don t have the awareness for that anymore I hate to see my fellow brother sister not doing well Please consider professional help or even message me if you want    sending you love and lightPeople don t want to hear the truth I guessWhat is the best quality of life improvement you have made post injury Got rid of my fianc   Found empathy and changed for the better as a person Taking it easy with booze  Botox for neurogenic bladder If you have a spastic bladder and issues with DSD or spasticity or leakage it s the best Not cheap not painless if you re incomplete but SO much better  the best thing I did  is replace cigarettes with caffine and then almost totally stop caffine  only coffee in mornin and now I can function better without stinking like a cigarrette or peeig every 30 min and now I learned a way to make that even better      HURRAY i learned patience through a lengthy hospital and initial rehabilitation stay  finishing college and going forward with education and career afterward 1 The ability to drive by hand controls has had the greatest impact on my life after a T11 spinal cord injury  Independence is priceless Now I can keep my chair in my car and go anywhere   2 Going back to work post injury  This proves to me that I am not worthless and takes the negativity out of my life  Mine was my baclofen pump and recently weed I was on sooo many pain meds and Ambien for years I have been able to get off of them almost completely I take an oxy 5mg maybe twice a week I m not saying I smoke weed all day everyday   On another note I had my first child last year My Outlook on life is way better but the quality of sleep is not so great  A cushion kind of like this  http   ig photo137 com html CDM ZK802701 C 2 1 jpg  http   ig photo137 com html CDM ZK802701 C 2 1 jpg  Understanding and dealing with my emotions  Tie between Botox for bladder and figuring out how to transfer into and drive a car independently  Driving independently was my first but biggest QoL improvement since injury was a Stoma literally changed my life I should have done it 8 years earlier  Stopped taking all the meds the prescribed to me after injury and finally getting married to my fiance Life is beautiful my friends  Found out I would die early Why NiceI say this too   Though    I was injured at 6 months old so I wasn t really aware of anything   I do believe that I would have grow up to be an entirely different person and that person would have probably been a huge douchebag I completely agree I didn t realize how callus I was towards things that didn t affect me I wasn t necessarily an A hole but I might ve been pretty close to it I m now a borderline hippie at age 29 My answer too I can sleep through night now without having to get up to pee Can this help with bladder retention at all or would it have a negative effect on that Do you mean a highly contoured cushion or ones with cutouts for your sacrum InfoNeither are a spinal cord injury they are spinal deformities that may have neurological effects  ie nerve root compression  Spondylolysis in severe cases can cause spinal cord damage but is usually surgically managed before that point   The difference is in spinal cord injury there s injury or lesion directly involving both nerve and motor tracts in injuries above the cauda equina  about T12 L1    Your disorders are legit just might not find a good overlap with this sub which is for another condition As for a herniated disc it s possible just like anything is there are discs between all the vertebral bodies but in Spondylolysis my understanding is that the bone integrity in the vertebrae is weak and collapses meaning the forces on the spine end up damaging the vertebrae in a given place in the spine not the discs between them They could however herniate at a different point on the spinal column    NOTE  Not a doctor I worked in an orthopaedic research lab for 2 years then later a spinal cord injury research centre for 3 years   Thank you Finding work with an sci with limited hand finger movementHis work will almost certainly be

it is ridiculous to have to balance your disability as such but it is a real situation This post brought a smile to my face  Just thought you d like to know that  Thanks Thanks I work pretty hard and get mostly A s and high B s I ve also been working on building good relationships with my professors so that they can vouch for me and my abilities when I m trying to go to grad school and work and stuff It s kind of frustrating to have to work harder to be seen as qualified and capable tbh but it is what it is I guess Calorie needs weight loss and exerciseWould it be possible to get a cheap manual chair along side the power chair If you go from already in your words obese and walking the move to even less physical activity with full time power chair usage may not be the best option As for the eating I only eat one meal a day with a coffee in the morning I know its not the healthiest way of calorie management but it keeps my weight down  I am always a high proponent for swimming  No worries of traumatic falls no crutches slipping underneath you no braces pinching your skin no worries of inaccessibility It s great    I m supposed to have a manual chair coming by September  assuming government funding and all that goes according to schedule  They re giving it to me primarily for school travelling going around indoors but once I ve graduated from university  in about a year or so  or if I m unable to keep going to school I have to choose one chair  as they won t let me have both a manual and a powerchair without work school etc justification      x200B   I m hoping that I can build the strength and technical skills necessary to use the manual full time before I have to make the choice between the two but I m not sure I can  curbs and horrendous potholes and snow slush being what it is      x200B   I do have a recumbent exercise bike and I can use it for about 10 minutes a few times a week if my back legs aren t acting up I m trying to get moving again and am scheduled to enter a rehab program in the fall coming spring but unfortunately I spent a lot of time bedbound and on a lot of heavy duty psych meds  my arachnoiditis was dismissed as a mental health issue  so weight wise and muscle wise I ve got a lot of work to do cerebral palsy issues notwithstanding Thanks   Apparently my local rehab centre has a pool so I ll ask about this   31yrs still looking for answer deleted  Try using external catheters condom shaped  with urine collection bags do you take anti spasmodic meds for your bladder   ditropan is one I believe   no doubt your bladder has shrunken over time   maybe see about having some of your small intestine to expand your bladder to hold more urine a buddy of mine had that done to expand his bladder   but yes an external catheter with a leg bag is how I roll   ditropan never stopped my bladder from spasms especially ones that were caused by stress such as pushing up an incline Self adhering Condoms by Bard  been using them for 20 yrs never had a leak if changed daily  for those that have retraction issues applying a thin coat skin prep then Uro bondIII cement by urocare then apply self adhereing condom   it s IMPOSSIBLE to leak it s like superglue   NO skin breakdowns I have a theory that cathing extremity frequently causes the muscle to lose its ability to stay closed and keep urine in This is why I ve been pushing myself to only cath every 6 hours unless I have lots of intake or caffeine if I go out drinking I cath every 2 hours because beer But anyways I don t have much issue with it unless I have a uti Have you considered a Supra Pubic Catheter It s a straw inserted directly to the bladder located above the pubic mound It allows for a continuous drain  I m a female C6 complete and I love my Supra All I have to do is have my care taker empty my bag every morning and I m good to go  Botox is a good more permanent solution but while waiting I d suggest incontinence pads They re like women s menstruation pads but bigger Get the heavy ones You can find an assortment on Amazon This I cath 3 4 times per day can sleep for 16  hours without peeing my bed I can actually be out in the cold without having to pee every 20 fucking minutes it s a miracle sorry it took so long for me to reply  this is an option I have never heard  I would very much like to have more info  I am inbetween urologists right now cuz of ins  could ya tell me more about it that is what I have done for the whole 31yrs  condoms just leak  I wore a strap on it for 30yrs which damaged my penis and doctors said nothing about that so Now I have been without a strap for almost a year and amazingly Penis is coming back to normal girth so comdom caths fit better but they still leak  I really appreciate the conversation I need to figure this out  Gravity doesn t seem to be workin with meSeconded bit I use generic Detrol LA As for bladder volume it was a painful few weeks but I took my urologist s advice doubled my Detrol during that time and during waking hours held it as long as I could Upped my comfortable volume from 200ml to about 400ml   Another step was to hydrophilic catheters used for about 2 days before replacing I do have coverage but I know how many people do not which is why I refuse to to use those only one time and then throw them out Of course there are exceptions such as when I m in public But those few steps made a big difference for me   I know a lot of people do not have the time to take two weeks off of work or school to try to train their bladder but in the long term it was very beneficial   Last thought do you possibly have an low underlying infection despite what you were doing Whenever mine seems to flare up and get worse that s when my capacity to retain diminishes That said I m not on any constant low dose antibiotic and what I m doing seems to work   I hope that helps to give you just a little bit of direction in solving this incredibly frustrating circumstance what do ya mean by spasms   Thank you for respondingin the past when I left urinie in the bladder for 2 long is what use tp give me a UTI do ya have a way aro  und that cuz cathing a lot I havenot haf a uti in well over a yearI am so excited that you care enough to answer  thank you so much     I had an infection in the skin on my penis over a year ago and the doctors sent me home with a fully in me  after 3 days I had a infection in my right testicle so bad I had to have it removed and while healing from that they put a super pubic in me  So I know what they are like the only thing is I live such a rough and tumble life that It would either get pulled out or give more and worse infections but I have never talked to a paralized woman and I would appriciate conversing with you if that is ok  just tell me how to talk to ya and maybe I could learn more Bowel routine I am a C4 quad who is totally dependent on a caregiver for BP I do mine in bed on my side every other day  Caregiver uses an Enemeez Takes a little over an hour from start to finish I take Colace every day  I have been told that over time enemas could cause flaccid bowel   I am 22 years post injury and gained enough function to move my bowels without any medical or digital stimulation a few years after injury Of course stopping a raging poop is impossible   I took fiber pills for a while but as long as I eat regularly and drink plenty of water and some moderate exercise   like pushing a mile a day or so   everything is pretty easy Gotta watch out with alcohol though   probably not much help but it is all I know Its honestly very dependent on you and your injury I know lots of paras who are independent with there program and even a low level quad who does as well  As far as I know they all use different methods some have success with suppositories and others with enemas  Im a C5 6 quad for 22 years For a decade I used suppositories and it just took too long Then for 5 6 yeah I used Enemez which is basically a mini enema It worked great for a time then I started having regular accidents and changed to regular fleet enemas  They both take about the same time and the regular fleet enema did a better job and resulted in more regularity  I have a caregiver assist me so they can help me shower right after my program  Its just so much easier with a caregiver assisting If I were to try and manage it all independently it would take hours  My routine I do daily and takes about an hour sometimes a little less  that includes bowel program shower and dressing   Something else to consider is called the Peristeen Enema system by coloplast  the catheter company  I know several quads who have started using this and have had great success gaining some regularity and even cut down the frequency of their program  It basically a larger volume enema delivery system that does a better job of cleaning you out  Its just pricey and often not approved by insurance  here s a link to more info about it https   www coloplast us peristeen anal irrigation system en us aspx  Last bit of advice take care with your diet certain foods will lead to problems and if you notice issues after eating certain things just take special care with them Most importantly stay hydrated it makes a world of difference not just for bladder health but bowel regularity as well  If you have a physiatrist spinal cord injury doctor  ask them about it as well there may be medication you take that could effect things They will also have a great understanding of the pros and cons and how it all specifically relates to you  I was injured June 2018  T10 complete  and for the last year this has been a bane   I started off with full medical support They tried to get me to use the commode but my balance was still too poor I was given bisocodyl suppositories each evening and wore diapers for retrieval   Eventually I inherited this process Unfortunately for the suppositories to work I had to fall asleep So I continued the process from the hospital on my own It was messy and required too much cleanup   I started noticing I had a fair amount of peristalsis I always had duke in the channel I had to remove manually So I experimented and started to only rely on that for removal I spoke to my physiatrist and she was comfortable with this   In the last week I ve graduated to the commode where I perform the manual removal   From what I ve learned suppositories are great but can reduce tone and peristalsis over time Were you to recover from your injuries that would create further complications Though many SCIs have spoken of using them long term with no issues   Overall your level of injury Asia severity and mobility will dictate the program best suited for you It is very much a messy trial and error process Hopefully you find some guidance in the thread  I m a C6 C7 quad Ive been injured about a year and a half I have no voluntary movement I m my hands minimal core and a little over 50  of my left tricep and a little under 25  of my right I m totally independent I still live at home but the only thing I don t do yet is drive   I do my bowel program on a shower chair over the toilet Daily Digital stimulation Takes about 30 minutes to an hour depending on the day Just gotta keep up with the water and insoluble fiber intake I use miralax when needed too I use a lot of hemorrhoid prevention cream too   It only took me about a month or two to become completely independent with it but it takes a little longer to learn the signs of when you need to drink more vs more fiber vs more miralax   L2 L3 L4 L5  while at rehabilitation i had no independence for both urination and bm was given only 3 months from insurance and was not long as my dr wanted me to stay heading towards the end i was just determined i was not cathing at home bm was assumed to use laxatives when they wanted me to sit on the toilet i pushed hard finally movement i think i had to find the muscle again or something that was almost 10 yrs ago even today its a willed effort and some manipulation manually  C6 here i used to have nurse insert micro enemas for a about 15 years Some top lads on here helped me find a suppositorie inserting device and the magic bullet suppositorie After a 7 month bit of training with the nurse im independent Lets see if i can a vid https   youtu be IeMaFqcK8yg  Hope this helps Thanks for the responses Its good to have different opinions and information c4 5 incomplete quad here over a decade post injury I use 4 to 5 magic bullets per day  about 4 hours on the john trying to compress that time  Forgive me but I don t understand what you mean by having help with it versus being independent  Can you explain please  I used to do this exact routine  C5 6   I changed it to a magic bullet generic suppository Now I do it on the shower chair commode My caregiver helps me transfer and insert a suppository I stopped taking colace and now just take a fiber supplement psyllium husk It actually helps a lot being regular This is pretty much exactly my routine   I was given bisocodyl suppositories each evening and wore diapers for retrieval   This sounds terrible for you and them Glad you are doing better Like a nurse or caregiver doing it versus doing it independentlySCI and Dating deleted  I m not sure if this applies to her but I have a lot of fatigue issues from my injury where I can get very tired from the simplest of physical things some days where it might seem like I m being lazy   Ps good job for being a top bf    I would like to be the best bf I can but i don t want to over step my boundaries   Say this to her  It should spark some helpful conversation   My advice is to always ask before helping especially before moving her body or chair  Also ask before moving her household objects or at least put them back where you first found them  Can t tell you how many times I ve started dating a new person who comes over to my house and then things get moved and I suddenly can t reach them anymore  My partner and I started dating shortly after my injury  L1 incomplete  but we had been trying to feel each other out for about two years prior And he s just plain fantastic about everything   I think part of what makes him so good is how he is willing to help with everything but also understands that I need to do things myself So I guess be available to help but don t be overzealous with it Also be aware that the things she ll want need your help with will change depending on pain and stamina Over time you ll be able to figure out what things she ll want help with and what things she can do on her own   Also sex is going to be different You ll probably need to figured out some things that aren t penis in vagina sex Not saying you can t do that but you ll need to figure out new things as well   There are going to be good days and bad days Take advantage of the good days and try to be more supportive on the bad   And make sure you take care of yourself too This is a huge life changing event for both of you You re allowed to feel different emotions If you need to talk to someone about your feelings please do  Talk to her everyone is different when it comes to receiving help but communication is key  There will likely be some places on her body that she wants you to almost never touch especially never in a poking   playing way Then other places that are just find to do so So asking and learning all the little secrets of her body is going to be a whole thing unto itself But if you do accidentally hurt her don t panic Its easy to cause me pain and hard to cause me injury Pain happens Just be caring and try to learn from it Best of all just stay honest an open as you would in any relationship  I have super big personal space issues now maybe be aware of that Touching her chair can be like touching her so be careful with that Super cool bro I hope it works for you guys  Great advice   Ok how about when people state at either of us It breaks my heart when it happens  Hey Im a guy but i do have experience in dating before and after having a SCI I think you should basically tell her what you told us that you do not want to overstep your boundaries and you want to be as respectful and gentlemanly as you can possibly be You should ask her to let you know when you are over stepping   The most awkward things in a relationship with someone with a SCI are the sex and intimacy and issues going to the bathroom Please do not be judgemental or say anything that you think would be seen as disrespectful Its awesome that youre coming to us for advice good first step   But most importantly just treat her like you would anyone able bodied person Its hard for us out here but for what its worth its not awful being in my chair Id rather not be stuck in it for the rest of my life but I am and i gotta make the most out of a shit situation    As a C6 incomplete the best advice i can give you is to really listen to her and understand her needs find out her pet peeves and the do s and don ts for example i hate it when people stand behind me constantly asking me if i need help and pushing me without asking also being open minded and helpful with a medical situation aka leaking or a surprise BM mentally there s a lot to learn as well we all handle our injuries differently and finding your way to help mentally can help this is my opinion so hopefully it helps  Goodluck have fun  This is probably the hugest part of day to day living as a para quad It s a big hurdle for the person with the injury and even for people around them I d advise just keep your distance  help if she asks  and be prepared for her to just leave mid sentence for the bathroom This is a big one My fianc  is in a chair I usually keep an extra pair of basketball shorts and a towel in my car for this reason Thankfully it s only happened once But it helps to be preparedYup this is probably the biggest one I could think of Do you mean stare  If so  it s a normal thing for people to look a little extra at people in chairs  it s just curiosity It can be annoying  but there is nothing you can do People are going to look man people look at  different  people in wheelchairs like me and your gf You just gotta pay no attention I just hope they dont judge or say something mean However sometimes if Im feeling extra sassy If they give me a bad look I give them the same bad look they gave me lmao   You ll get used to the stares Ive been in a chair for almost 4 years now  Im 24  and I still get stares And even if ive already met them I get stares I get looks from little kids a lot theyre pretty funny I am a massage therapist currently working at an SCI recovery center I was just curious about what experiences you ve had with massage positive and negative What made it good What made it bad How can I encourage people to feel safe and confident getting on my table I have been a massage therapist for 15 years and worked with a few SCI clients   If someone has been injured or is stationary for a long time it is possible to dislodge a blood clot Also if they have not been weight bearing for a long time bone density can be fragile and it is possible to cause damage with range of motion  I knew a guy who s leg was broken that way so if sensation is limited palpate very carefully and pay close attention Signs of a blood clot include swelling heat and distention distal from the clot I ask all my clients if they are on blood thinners because that will generally tell you if they ve had blood clot issues In these cases I avoid things that cause venous return like effleurage on medial arms and legs If someone is pretty active biking or standing this is a bit less of a concern  I love massages in general  I ve had mostly positive experiences though one time I kind of felt like I was getting beaten up   Even though the sensation isn t as strong below my injury level I greatly enjoy having my feet done and my thighs too  because sometimes they cramp up   How do people get up onto your table  Does it move up and down  That s the problem I ve had with massage in the past the tables have often been too high for me to get onto   I was told by my rehab PT to not get massage on the paralyzed parts of my body  below the waist for me  because of the possible danger of dislodging a blood clot  Have you heard this   Massage around the fused parts of my spine have been less enjoyable than the rest of my back  and at the level of my injury the pulling friction on the skin can be painful so oil or lotion is a must  I always enjoy a lot of arm should and hand work because I use those parts to push my chair  Scalp massage is probably my favorite part  SCI is very stressful during the early days and I find scalp massages to be very relaxing   I ve also noticed that many masseuses will skip pectoral massages with me  I m female   I would encourage you to not skip this with your female patients  I think that asking permission beforehand is a good thing though   I ve wanted one for years but I ve never gotten one I can t get over the thought of paying a ton of money for a shoulder massage  my partner has an sci and has been getting bi weekly professional massages for at least 5 years really helps with muscle pain cramping tension and mobility we recently got a table and i got some basic training so now she gets home massages 3x week focusing on areas below the sensation line since getting the table pain days are way less frequent   highly recommend getting massages or body work on a regular basis if possible there are so many different types of body work so if you ve ever had a less than ideal experience don t let that stop you from exploring other options   if i ve learned anything feet need more love than we usually think watching netflix and giving yourself feet rubs is a pretty good night in my book  oh man I could totally use a good shoulder massage I wholeheartedly believe in massage I started getting them about two years into my injury  I am about 11 years out now   I wouldn t have been able to function without them because of how bad my knots were I went to a regular massage for 8 years going every other week It helped but I didn t get enough relief for long enough I started working full time and it got so much worse At that point I decided to go to a deep tissue massage therapist and it absolutely changed my life My overall pain was reduced  My personal advice based on my experience is don t feel like you have to be delicate Every person is different so this might not be good for someone else I always wanted my first MT to push harder and go deeper With my current one she does that I learned that everything is connected and it s not always just where the knot is that needs to be worked on  My DTM was working on me last night and I was telling her I have been getting headaches in one spot at my eyebrow She said there is a trigger point in my neck that when it gets tight it will cause headaches in that exact spot  Look at the overall picture not just he knots  Not sure if this helps at all but this is just what I ve experienced learned   Edit  also it might be beneficial to request x rays if possible that can show you exactly where hardware is placed My partner is currently at a rehabilitation centre but he s leaving soon and there s no massage therapist there He is L1 incomplete and is having pain mostly in the right side of his middle back Would you recommend massage therapy for this Should we try to find someone who really knows what they re doing maybe a sports massage Could someone possibly do further damage to a SCI if it was done incorrectly We re not in the US Thanks  Thank you so much I m so glad a fellow therapist rang in I really appreciate it and will be more aware in the future Thank you so much for the feedback Wow Great feedback   I have PT assistants that help me to do lifts and get clients on and off the table   I have not heard about dislodging blood clots as a reason for contraction for SCI clients getting massaged but I will look in to it I was under the impression that circulatory massages were healthy for the patient tissue and overall general health   I agree that the flexors and extensors  arms  are a sweet spot for most of my clients I will integrate more pectoral work in to my sessions   Once again thank you for the helpful feedback Can you include your neck head arms hands and face  I would encourage you to try it at least once I find it to be totally worth it even when it s not full body It s not just a shoulder massage It s an investment to your overall health and well being In my eyes It keeps the tissue healthy and can help to release adhesions in the muscle tissue that can cause aches and pains If you ever find yourself in Southern California I d love to work on you and change your mind  I agree Superficial work is nice and relaxing but deep work is where change in the tissue can really be created I love trigger point therapy There is an amazing book that was written for self help practical use and not just targeted towards therapist   The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook  by Claire Davies It s a super east read with pictures showing where trigger points are and where they relay pain Good luck friend Depressed after scii had mine 11 years ago stuff changes things on average are about 10 20  harder but people are 1000  nicer so its give and take yeah i dont pee standing up anymore but i get special treatment everywhere i go lol   Not anything crazy but for instance i drive and ive been pulled over   cop  license and registration please   me   sure officer let me grab it from my wheelchair   cop gets a  ohfuckohshit  look on his face runs my license tells me to slow down and i go on my way after doing 88 in a 65  this was like 8 years ago gimme a break on the reckless driving   another time me and my gf were getting donuts at a famous donut place in portland ME we went up to the door and saw both a line around the corner and a step to get in I was like  oh ill just wait outside can you grab me one   the first person in line let  her  cut so i wouldnt have to wait outside too long lol   When I fly out of the country they have me skip the entire line through customs and bring me right to the front bing bang boom im through in a flash   Yeah no ticket speedy donuts and other little social perks dont make up for going not being able to go for a jog or peeing at a urinal but hey its fun to go around like a celebrity   It does get better though my first year i didnt have a car and i smoked weed all the time i was miserable i got a car and went back to college and got my degree With time the frustration fades   11 years later it still strikes once in a while though when i spasm into my wheelchair and cut my ankle wide open hopping into bed You curse you say f you you stupid wheelchair you lament deciding to make decisions youve made years ago then your pet comes over and youre like oh youre cute let me love you   Just try to keep moving forward dont look back and be happy you got what you still have It could be worse you could be into fortnite  June 15 is the year anniversary of my SCI I broke six vertebrae with one compression fracture at T10 and a burst fracture at L2 The last year has been hell riddled with pain fear anxiety and depression The latter is something I struggle with on a daily basis   So how do I cope I try to look at where I was when I was injured and post surgery to now The reminder that I ve persevered in the face of such a crippling injury really helps elevate my mood On top of that I try to keep busy as much as possible   Going to the gym keeping a tidy living space new fresh sheets and pillow cases as often as possible frequent small well balanced meals finding things to make you laugh spending time with those you love remembering how much those who love you do planning a trip  keep busy in positive ways The battle is constant but arming yourself with the right weapons helps a lot  it s difficult but shit happens and life goes on lol I had my sci 9 weeks ago and I m going back to uni in 3 weeks time The depression is natural following an sci My son has been tetra pelagic for 8 years He is very bright and uses his mind for relief He is very politically active reads voraciously and music has saved our lives  Don t be hard on yourself Forgive the idiots who say things like  Everything happens for a reason  and  I just know you will walk again  Be kind especially to yourself We depend on my son to help keep our family together He is so important to all of us Use humor when you can and never stop kicking ass   Hell yeah Knowing how quickly the reality of my life changed is a constant thought But eventually you find a sport and get back to ballin on bitches T2 T9 incomplete A doctor gave me the best advice  Get back to normal as soon as you can   He said doing things like just getting out of bed at first then work to the next thing would help I am 2 yrs post op and he was right Even on the days that I want to stay in bed and feel sorry for myself I make myself get up and get dressed That alone often makes me feel better I do my best not to focus on what I have lost Instead I turn my focus onto what can I accomplish today Every little thing I do is an accomplishment Brushing my teeth going to the restroom and many others things aren t done the same but they are my new normal so why not do them to the best of my ability I also talked to my doctor about the depression He was able to help with medications for the short term and recommend counseling I also joined a local group that brings people with different spinal cord injuries together once a month It is a great way to meet others that are going through similar issues  Hey   Im a T7 complete Music movies friends and just doing something different everyday helped me after my SCI But music helped me the most Do something you love  I ve been told it s like experiencing the stages of grief and it echoes through the family to That s kind of helped us negotiate our new kind of life Day to day I literally take it a day at a time pace myself and take time out to do nice things just for me x That whole getting through customs thing is no joke I ve never gotten more dirty looks from people than when I pass right through customs in two minutes It s glorious I like what you said about persevering in the face of your injury It takes a lot of courage to go through something like an SCI I m C5 incomplete I often think back on how difficult the struggle has been and yet I m still me and I haven t given up Anyone who is dealing with this type of an injury should look at their perseverance as an achievement Good for you Inspiring and awesome Septic arthritisCurious what your symptoms were Maybe the symptoms leading up to the sepsis Unfortunately I ve gone thru the septic shock thing    I wish you the speediest of recoveries regardless  Cheers Are they sure it s not Heterotopic Ossification an

we might have for it  fragile skin  ie pressure ulcers  sources of infection like UTI for example I know I had a hip replacement about 7 years ago and my surgeon was particularly concerned that I

sure it fits though A lot of them don t fit women correctly  I had to wear a child s size I wore one for 3 months and after awhile it gets more comfortable on that off  What type of brace is it The Philadelphia is what I had originally but I switched to the Aspen I found the Aspen to be much more comfortable She may be able to just wear the back part of the brace soon I d ask the doctor about it  I m a registered nurse on a spinal cord injury rehab unit  Try a travel pillow  I ve had many patients tell me these help  I don t mean to hijack this thread but do you have any advice for someone with a laminectomy  C5 C7  who wants to sleep on his back but cannot Those of you who have been injured for 10 years or longer what keeps you going What have you learned 37 years for me  I was injured at 6 months old  It is my  normal    What keeps me going  Life  Everything in it  Music  Family  Friends  Theater  Sports  Hobbies  Nature  Seeing what the future holds  There is so much  So so much  I ve only been injured for 10 weeks and the thought for living like this for the rest of my life is horrifying I don t think I have it in me so I d like to know what people have to say  30 years Life is life and me sitting down doesn t really come into it  24 years the wheelchair plays a very small part of my life now so when you say  what keeps you going   that does not really make sense I keep going cause life is good I am married have two children a good job and backyard that needs gardening     x200B   What have I learnt That it gets easier that is harder in your mind that it is living it in reality Get out there and push yourself and you will find that it is just different  I find something every day to laugh about I take my emotional health deadly seriously     x200B   Also we live in an age of technological miracles if not outright spiritual ones There is more hope for people with spine injuries today than at any point in the history books  Not much i can say would make any newly injured ppl feel better Sadly i think you just need time to realise and accept things yourself I ve been a tetra for 17 years and i still occasionally think  holy shit I m paralysed  That being said i do find myself enjoying aspects of life something i struggled to do for a long ling time Starting my 40th year   best advice I have is forget about the wheelchair   the difficulties that come with SCI Those things aren t going away  but if you focus on them they re tougher to deal with If you don t work then establish some other goals this will keep you busy instead of thinking about how I m going to deal with my disability The more goals you accomplish the more you realize the wheelchair isn t an issue just a minor speed bump  The same things that keep everyone with or without a disability going  My 3 children were the thing that really motivated me from about 1 week in I was in high dependency care for 4 months after my accident and was flat on my back for 99  of it When I had my first visit from them I needed to get upright and be able to hug them tightly  My youngest was 11 months old when I had my accident and during my 11 months as an inpatient in the spinal unit she learned to walk This was a great rehab motivator and not just for me  Now 10 years later my oldest has just gone off to University and the thing I miss about her the most is the tight hugs she used to always give me  You need to find small things to anchor yourself and you MUST celebrate the smallest to the largest victories Life is made up of millions of small moments and you need to grab the joy from every one you can  You really do get used to it Somewhere between 2 years and 5 years post injury you start to feel like yourself again and a combination of life going on and being able to be more autonomous and having figured out 70  of the SCI complications and management stuff tends to help most people find a way to move forward with their lives in some way Doesn t mean it s easy or bad if you have trouble doing so  it s just what I notice from most folks At 10 weeks out you still have tons of potential in terms of healing At 10 weeks my husband  C5 C6 incomplete  couldn t sit up on his own he couldn t feed himself he had zero use of his left arm and his doctors still hadn t nailed down the right combination of medication for him   His accident will have been a year ago on Friday and now he s going to physical therapy twice a week to strengthen his legs and learn how to walk on his prosthetic  he lost his left leg at the knee in the accident  he s able to make and eat simple meals for himself as long as they don t involve too much dexterity or grip strength and he can use his left arm to stabilize things  grip may or may not come back in that hand we re working with a hand specialist on that    It s still hard I m not going to lie to you He ll never be 100  He may never have full grip in either hand and he ll probably always have leg spasms and a limp from the prosthetic He has days when he s frustrated and depressed But what really helps him is manageable goals to work towards He played a lot of sports as a kid and he attacks his recovery like he s training by setting small realistic goals   His very first goal Being able to flip people off again His occupational therapists thought this was hilarious and were so proud of him when he was able to flip them all off at the end of his inpatient rehab stay Getting a dog after SCI  Questions T5 complete here  I have an Airedale terrier with boundless energy  I walk her about 5 k a day in a mountain trike and she does most of the work  It s the highlight of both of our days  I got an attachment designed to go on a bicycle seatpost to hook her harness up  You can also get a service dog too I m raising a puppy with Canine Companions for Independence they provide free service dogs to people with physical disabilities and SCI s There s just a waiting period is all  Get one adopt an older calm pup I m an L1 complete I tried all of the leashes before finding one I like I settled on one I strap to my thigh and I like that even more because my hands never hit it while I push like the one around the waist   My biggest challenge is putting the brakes on my chair quick enough to yank back on her when she gets loopy after a bird The first bit I thought we d never make it and now we walk for hours and hours  you WILL NOT regret it  A while ago I was taking a labrador for a walk she was really well trained and we practiced her pulling me It was awesome and we would zip down the streets until one day I lost control and flew of the pavement into a parked van on the side of the road I fully just bailed straight into it and I was on the road out of my chair Some people saw it all and came running to help but the doggo was also really protective and went full defense mode So there I was lying on the ground in pain after wrapping myself around a parked van with this dog barking and growling and not letting anyone near me to help It took a good ten mins to calm her down so that the people could get in and put me back in my chair     Not sure how that helps with your questions sorry I also had a pomeraniam and it was the best little mutt I have ever owned She was awesome Highly recommend dogs just be careful when walking them  They make leashes that attach around your waist Easy peasy  T6 8 incomplete  I got a rescue dog almost 3 years ago and it s been awesome  He s 1 4 Dachshund and 1 4 Mini Pinscher  The other 1 2 I have no idea about   He sleeps most of the day but when he is awake he has a ridiculous amount of energy   I have several videos on my YouTube channel about life with my dog   When I first got him     https   www youtube com watch v rhjP QA4wqs  Walking him  while using braces   crutches      https   www youtube com watch v GuX6pfgqDKw  Walking him  while using my wheelchair      https   www youtube com watch v jZLPpeyYYgE  Picking up after him  his poop that is      https   www youtube com watch v qfpNUnTv_y0  Overall I d have to say that getting a dog is one of the best decisions I ever made   Oh almost forgot  My pup is 32ish lbs but he was 18lbs when I got him  He was SEVERELY underweight on account of being on the street for who knows how long   My vet said that 25 30 lbs would be a good weight for him but he s a little above that because he is so adorable that I can t refuse him when he wants to lick my dish after I finish eating    p  Hope this info is helpful  T9 A I had a 40 50 lb English Bulldog I just trained her with the same fixed length leash  not those retracting one  and never had an issue wallking her alongside grass Only new thing I ran into is where to hang the full poop bag on the way to the can   my solution was tying it to the frame behind my knee My gf had a sci She has 2 bog dogs a great dane and a st bernard She doesnt have any problems with them and they are both great dogs I ve started the application process with them in my area how is your experience  I m only at the first interview  When you say you re raising a puppy with them do you mean you re working with them until the dog is 2 years old  How long are you going to be raising the dog at CCI s facility  I m trying to get a feel for how long the process is once the waiting period is over and you start interacting with the dog that will likely be yours Haha I think this addresses how you walk them thanks for sharing the story pretty epic Glad you re ok Work after a sciC4 5 and work full time Office work and two days a week from home They ve flexed my hours and are quite understanding I don t think they realize how much effort it takes though  T 12 L 1   wheelchair 100   I am a college professor  but I travel some for recreation I work in a desk job in academic publishing but I do travel a lot for work I m a walker  with crutches  so it does make things easier but it s tiring   I went back to full time after three weeks off  well I did a phased return to work but I was back to full time within 8 weeks  and that was really stupid I should have taken much much more time off but I didn t really know what was typical at the time Needless to say I burned out and took a sideways move to a job with less management responsibility but yeah It s been tough I work from home two days a week to make it more manageable  It s almost been a year since my injury  6 15 18  and I am not ready to return to my desk job I m a T10 complete fully bound to the chair with no ability to function below the belly button at all After breaking 6 vertebrae I had a fusion from T6 to the pelvis   Working in compliance it s lots of reading laws and regulations With all the pain and the cloudiness from the meds I wouldn t be able to perform my job adequately It would be challenging with my current comprehension   It s my intention to return to work at the beginning of 2020 Ideally I d return sooner but it s more important to me to have my health in order first   I m not sure where you re at on your journey but I encourage you to  do you  first If you can get by without working to aid recovery or plan your next move take advantage of it If you re ready to apply to new industries then do so Regardless make sure you re healthy and you educate yourself on the new field you re seeking  Engineering I really only have trouble with going to test cells and customer field units which is rare An adaptive mouse headset and dictation software means I m more productive than some of my able bodied colleagues and or the junior engineers I oversee Honestly the biggest pain in the butt   yeah I said it   is stopping my work meetings to lean back for a pressure relief It can really disrupt a productive train of thought but better than a pressure sore  I guess the other issue is getting a bathroom break around noon every day I don t have the manual dexterity to do that and rely on a friend to drain a leg bag I m pretty self conscious about that and I get nervous that people are going to notice  Not me but my BF is a T10 complete para recently completed his master s degree in social work now he is an employed social worker He is currently studying to get licensed so he can be a therapist for clients  Project manager I can walk very short distances I use crutches to go upstairs to my desk but I time my day to minimize the number of times I need to do this  I also have a scooter at work to go long distances in the factory I find that using the stairs maintains some muscle strength which I had to rebuild after some time off work It hurts me but it s good for me too  If you don t use it you lose it  T5 Doctor  C5 Was in banking but I couldn t make it my career cus it s not stimulating enough It can work out cus lot of it was desk work and typing on a computer while talking to clients Not physical at all To move up you hit your targets and take courses   Of course you ll need to be comfortable with your disability cus people will be sitting right across from you and for me it was daunting at first cus of my limited hand function but I got over it pretty quick and it actually propelled me into a much better place in terms of confidence  Thank you  I went to work as a school teacher it s a great job always accessible   only work 6 8 months of the year when you factor in school vacations  Hey   are you in Canada OP You can get in touch with the Neil Squire Society for retraining and funding for adaptive equipment etc   I work in an office job now most people I know do after SCI so computer skills and or admin finance programming web design  are really useful In Canada all federally regulated employers  banking aviation corrections etc  have programs for hiring people with disabilities which is a good place to start and they have great extended health benefits  Software developer good job good pay  How do you add that  C4 C5 ASIA A  to your name banner   It s unfortunate that you re probably right I doubt they realize the effort required Good on you though for putting it forth  I second academia   I worked for a university for 10 years it was a great employer for me If you re on baclofen I highly recommend the internal pump The very low doses are more effective and you ll notice improved cognitive function immediately I would agree to take care of yourself first and foremost there will come the time when you are healthy enough to return to work  I ve known some who went back after a couple months and some who went back to early and couldn t stay up with it    I went back a year after my accident luckily with the same company but started really slow two days a week for four hours  Gradually built that up to full time over about three months and have been full time since   I am T4 complete and luckily was able to get off the pain meds after getting out of rehab  The baclofen had a small effect but I just increased it again to 80mg a day and haven t noticed any additional cloudiness  I think it was probably quitting weed that cleared my mind the most but I was a heavy user for many years and the negatives outweighed the benefits for me I use a wireless leg bag emptier all I do is find a drain or patch of grass to empty my leg bag onto The one problem that I have though is that I keep having to change the patches of grass because they are dying from the ammonia concentrations I don t want it to be too noticeable that I m pissing in one spot  https   www freedom flow com   I am C4 5 I m majoring in aerospace engineering

what do you do now for work Yes i am Canadian sure I ll check that out thanks r DisabilityArtHow can I make my boyfriend feel sexy again I m 29yo and have been a quadriplegic for about 8 years now My wife is pretty similar to you She always compliments me on my appearance and I brush it off It s not that I don t believe I m attractive in her eyes It s tough to see myself the same as I was in my prime  before the accident at age 21  I was a big 6 3  230lb muscular guy It s tough to look at myself and basically see a 4  150lb shell of myself   It s definitely a body issue and I have accepted that I m not going to be that muscular guy anymore I m sure that I m still considered  handsome  I guess but I still can t help to jump back to what I used to be This is definitely a lot more different than a good looking guy in high school who aged terribly over 20 years This was a sudden traumatic experience which instantly changed how my body works and looks   I know this doesn t really help you with your question but this might help with the psyche of a Para or Quad Also to be quite honest I don t sulk or get too depressed about myself not feeling  sexy   This might be the most honest comment I ve read on this sub Reddit I can relate to every bit of it   Previously 6 foot tall 180 pounds athletic and built like the landscaper I was He probably feels ok with himself   lots of self deprecatory language  gimp cripple old  is the way some of us put up a shield  not sure you can make your so feel sexy   but what you can do is to complement him on things he does well sexually and in life  being told I am good at something makes my day at almost 22 years post injury positive words about the things I do well makes my day  cooking to gardening to picking a good restaurant to being great at my job   doesn t matter what it is as long as it is a legitimate compliment about something I do well  don t shoe horn in positive words but a genuine appreciation for his presence   that melts me  damn I miss having someone in my life    Pretty much mirror the young guys on here I was 30 and athletic build I often refer to my self as a cripple or a mangy cripple I hate the pc terminology The cripple thing is about owning the injury as brutal as that sounds my close mates call cripple dick   a ref of pickle Rick from Rick n Morty  and I call them fat old ugly etc  As for body image honesty it s an insecurity thing I don t think it can be gotten wrid of Only perhaps understood If anyone on here has found a way to love the way they look now frankly I d not believe them All I would say is that I know he will be deeply deeply greatfull for the love and attention you give him even if he s spouting cripple crap  My advice is just ignore or brush off the insecure comments about his body do not try reassure him  even better take the piss out of him instead    I don t really have an answer for you but know that you are not alone There is a group on facebook that my wife has found very helpful Search for a group called WAGS Wives and Girfriends of SCI   Still very helpful thank you Thank you u uncle_stinky you are great at giving helpful tips to internet

With speedicath flex Unfortunately that doesn t work with these ones for meHome buying tips It took me 6 months to find a house that would work I picked something one story on a slab foundation because it only had two steps I also picked a fixer upper because I knew I wanted to make the kitchen and bathroom accessible My house is from 1950 and ended up being small enough    1000 sq ft  that it had no internal load bearing walls so I gutted the entire house and reconfigured the rooms and doorways to be wheelchair friendly I also re poured the sidewalks into ramps I used money from insurance from my accident to pay for the renovations but it is awesome to have something fully accessible so I can live independently I also found that new condos are a good option because many of them have wheelchair accessible units but I was happy to find a small house  We got super lucky with our house I was house hunting while my husband was still in rehab and everything I looked at was going to need  some  sort of renovation   usually doorways and bathrooms I finally found one that was absolutely perfect except for one doorway that needed to be widened and some modifications to the back deck It was the perfect price in a great location and had only been on the market for two days so we put in an offer   We were not the first offer and we did not get the house   Then I stumbled on a new construction neighborhood that had a 1 story option with a fairly open floorplan I sat down and talked to the selling agent about modifications and they said that they could make any changes I wanted as long as it didn t involve moving a lode bearing wall or majorly changing the floorplan We were able to get a fairly flat lot with concrete ramps poured off two of the outside doors a walk in closet door moved to make it easier for Hubby to get into it all doorways widened except for the guest bedroom and guest bathroom a roll under sink in the master bath and a few other minor design amenities that just make things a little bit easier for him Even with the modifications and a few extras like a fence for our dog it still ended up in our price range  albeit at the high end    Not gonna lie it s not top quality workmanship since they re throwing these houses up with about 3 months turn around time but it s not shoddy either It s also a  lot  less than I would have spent buying and renovating any of the existing houses I looked it I have no idea what the housing market is like in your area but if you have one of those cookie cutter fast construction new neighborhoods near you it might be worth a look  Currently looking as well right now and I can already tell it s going to be a pain I m thinking about using some of my loan for renovations  I live in California and bought at just the right time A cheap fixer upper intentionally because we knew we d have to widen the bathroom doors and modify the bathrooms significantly We did a lot to the house and after we were done with renovations it brought the price of the house up to the price of the houses in the neighborhood We did look at a lot of houses I think we just knew we d have to put money into it to make it work I don t think that helped but hopefully a bit  Maybe you can get a loan with an extended amount over the price of the house to allow for modifications Good luck   I m thinking about using some of my loan for renovations   I was thinking that as well here in NY everything was made in 1950 or older when either people were smaller or they moved sideways through doors hahaA question about vibrators for men with spinal cord injuries I have a Magic Wand and have been successful with it If budget is a major concern try this option first It may take some time and practice to figure out exactly how you can elicit your orgasm reflex but this is your most affordable option if you re just  messing around   I ll show myself out   In terms of overall performance I recommend the FertiCare It s more powerful and we were much more successful with it Our fertility doctor had one that they would clean and allow you to use However it is much more expensive Depending on what your goals are talk to your doctor and see if they have the ability to arrange one for you to try   A word to the wise  keep an eye on your skin integrity Having the vibrator on one spot for too long can definitely damage your skin Also keep an eye on your dysreflexia A friend of mine used to get really bad headaches when he would use one   Good luck  https   www amazon com Wahl 7 Way Comfort Vibrator dp B0052ZWFPQ  This or a hitachi is what I would recommend the ferticare is just crazy overpriced Other vibes work to you just want to find something with a high amplification over a vibe with a faster frequency Basically the intensity of the vibrations is more important than the speed  There is also something called a viberect x3 that is designed specifically for people with spinal cord injuries But it is fairly expensive about  300  I have the ferticare and that works pretty damn great  i use the hitachi magic wand and it works for me Can I ask how you use it I ve tried the Hitachi and Ferticare and neither worked for meI use this and it works great What is benefit to use this Can I ask how you use it I ve tried the Hitachi and Ferticare and neither worked for meIntroducing

tomorrow how many levels they want to do a fusion on  Got in my accident at 24 also had laundry list of injuries to add to my SCI including 7 months in a halo No matter how long you re in that damn thing it ROYALLY sucks I will say what helped my mindset was decorating the halo bars with glittery tape bedazzling my knee stabilizer wearing cheetah print eye patches  3rd cranial nerve damage  and sticking my Alma Mater s flag on my wheelchair They were all so simple but they made me feel like myself within my injury My mental state started to improve after this   Just wanna say I m proud of you We re all glad you re here     Edit  not glad you re in the bull shit that is an SCI but glad you re still with us  SCI club sucks for sure but you gotta go on or get left behind   I hope things

get your pants off when you re sitting on the toilet How do you put it back on i shift my weight from one side to the other while pulling them down  repeat on the way back up It takes more work but I transfer to bed strip put a towel on my cushion then go to the loo I ve done the whole shifting side to side in the chair jazz but that can also open risks of sheering the skin creating an opportunity for a pressure ulcer  Are you talking underwear or trousers here  I feel much more secure wiggling in and out of my pants in my wheelchair Toilet seats never feel stable enough to me even if they have good grab bars nearby  I make my legs spasm a little so that they stiffen up and then arch my back with my back rest If that makes sense It s real seamless and like second nature Works great  wear those flex pants from izod american eagle  other jean companies as a man i love getting away with wearing jeggings to work lol   then swoop it all off in the chair hop to the pooper poop   once your done you pull undies up on the toilet then hop back in chair and use the wall handles to pull up your pants spasms can make it a pain but i stretch out on the toilet while pooping added benefit of that is it usually scares everyone else outta the bathroom when they hear the wheelie boye flopping around lol  I hop forward in wheelchair pull them down jump over to toilet and do the business ya kno  then I hop back onto the chair and wiggle from side to side and pull em up ezpz  On top of all the other advice I d say keep trying and practise I m female so trousers have to come off to pee So I had to keep trying and learn how if I wanted to wear trousers  Not OP but I struggle putting my pants back on in my chair Taking them off is no problem but putting them on makes them feel all bunchy But what if you need to go to a public toilet Both Specifically when you re gonna poop Quadriplegic Truck ConversionI have the exact setup I love it a quad cat where I teach has a Toyo full size  it

transfer up and in then grab my folding chair and put it behind the seat It took perhaps 30 seconds But in the rain I d still get pretty wet I did the same thing with a full sized Ford Bronco and a Jeep Cherokee No moving parts except hand controls   Ah to be young again  When gas prices were much cheaper and my shoulders didn t creak   Does your chair scratch the crap out of your truck I can t tell from the video  The poor dude would be me I took rain into consideration when getting the truck I can transfer into the truck without the lift if I m not tired but can t get the chair in My chair

you that s what I m looking into them for as well free trips left this summer and have been traveling a lot lately  Have rented a car twice with hand controls but there will be times where I ll be

skin breakdowns It seems incredible that a person could sit on a hard surface like that for the time it takes to complete a bowel program without encountering issues Surgery to a remove a  most likely benign  tumour at T9 T10those tumors don t actually grow into the spinal cord tissue hopefully by removing the compressing tumor your symptoms will improve Good luck Yeah hopefully I ve been lucky and we caught it in time as the surgeon told me they can cause permanent impairment    Short version of the story is  I decided to go see a physiotherapist to try and address my long running back hip and pelvic pain because I wanted to get back on my bike  you don t need a referral here so I just popped to a place up the street from me    The physio spotted an issue right away and got my GP to refer me for an MRI he   the physio  suspected cauda equina MRI showed herniated discs at lumbar level and what was reported as a massive herniation at tmT9 T10  My GP saw it and was referring me asap in my first specialist appointment the surgeon spotted the tumour and ordered another round of MRIs with contrast The tumour is really clear on that even to me   Before the physio the only symptom I really registered was pain but the tiny amount of massage he did possibly destabilised my spine and for last 6 weeks I have had significant whole body neurological issues  that I realise now were present all along but I hadn t really connected the dots  to the point where I have also had brain scans to rule out other disorders   MS mostly as there s a family history   Anyway as I said I wasn t sure this was the best place to ask but I have been struggling to find really good specific advice on spinal surgery recovery so I figured I d ask here   I owe my physio and the surgeon a lot really  I m seeing them both tomorrow  surgeon to discuss the results of my second round of MRIs and hopefully schedule my surgery properly  he s given me next month but no actual date yet   and my physio to discuss prep and recovery IntroductionI m obviously not a doctor but I believe any compromise of your spinal cord at that level would affect way more than numbness and weakness How do your legs and toes feel Do you have full range of motion  e g can you raise your knees to your chest in equal measure    I m assuming you ve been told this from every conceivable angle but you have absolutely nothing to lose by committing to a diet I m sorry but I don t think there s a single person in this sub that will disagree Your lifestyle is none of my business but if you can help it at all you owe it to yourself to take that extra stress off your spine because that is the one part of your body you do not want to fuck around with   For the arthritis I really like Celebrex It lasts most of the day and keeps me from relying on norco as much And keep doing PT  8 weeks is really not all that long  Get a second opinion Request a copy of your medical records including your MRI images PT notes and head to another specialist   Acupuncture is  at best  inconclusive when tested for efficacy   some groups show improvement others don t Decide what group you re in   Since you haven t mentioned any dysfunction below your arms I would guess you re having trouble with periphery nerves to your upper body   outside your spinal cord Only a neurologist can make that determination  That said there re rare conditions where the upper limbs are affected and not the lower Your limb or limbs don t have to be totally paralyzed for something to be considered  dysfunctional    Sounds like enough people have told you to lose weight but have you considered if you re a candidate for breast reduction surgery   Sorry you feel this way at such a young age I have no specific thoughts about your arthritis besides treating it aggressively How you re going to feel ten years from now depends a lot on what you do now  Good luck  Do you have auto accident before  Is cortisone injection common and safe  Hi there it s more likely you have a brachial plexus injury or other nerve root injury I know that it seems like not picking but in terms of the many systemic effects of a spinal cord injury nerve root injuries have specific localized effects just on the areas affected by that nerve plexus  ie your arms and hands  The good news is these nerve root or brachial plexus injuries have more solutions if they can target the areas where your nerve roots are being compressed than if you had a spinal cord injury Cortisone May help in the short term to deal with inflammation that may be compressing your nerve roots where they leave the spine but if they do help I d say that s the cue to see a surgeon about addressing the arthritis to preserve your brachial nerve supply My non medical understanding is that you may need a spinal fusion or discectomy  maybe disc replacement I think that s a thing  The key here is acting before you end up with permanent neuropathy  I was experiencing issues in my feet and shins Hard time walking and standing for long periods I got fancy shoes was tested for plantar fasciitis  and was told to take more breaks at work Not really an option with my previous line of work  I was tested for diabetes  and that is negative  I have wished for a breast reduction for years but you know finances never really permit that But maybe now I can ask my doctor  Thank you I know I need to make changes No I did not Not sure what exactly led to all this A combination of a heavy chest a physically demanding career previous physical abuse posture  Very common as safe as any medical procedure and medication ever is Would that show differently on my medical reports  The exact words  thank you to the person that told me to request a copy of my report  state    scattered degenerative changes

and just wanna sleep all the time How did my fellow SCI survivors do it You should check out the discord server for more of a conversation    https   discord gg z5DkwY Check low testosterone very common with SCI  I cant give you too much but for me the best motivation is finding something you love to do and try doing it It will take forever compared to before but if you can do it and get better at it keep doing it Turn it into a sort of job and get busy doing it The worst thing that I have done is spend time thinking too much about my situation The more distractions I have and the more fun I have the better  Hope that helps a little  Take care of yourself  Major depressive disorder is common after SCI and TBI but lack of motivation is also an effect of severe TBI Severe TBI of the frontal lobes often impairs  executive function  https   memory ucsf edu symptoms executive functions  and your having trouble  handling the consequences of it all  may be related to that  and forgive me if that speculation is incorrect    Your symptoms may be multifactorial   you may be treating the depression with Lexapro but the TBI related components aren t necessarily being addressed with the SSRI  For example amantadine or stimulants like methylphenidate can be used to improve alertness focus motivation etc post TBI  Consider seeing a psychiatrist as well as your TBI SCI

pressure sore before I snapped out of mine  Wish I had a quick easy answer for you but it was about getting to the place where I want to live my day rather than wait for a miracle cure  I know it s a crazy trend right now but CBD and medical marijuana is doing wonders for me My depression is highly aggravated when I lose sleep So ever since I ve been using CBD I ve got my sleep back which improves my depression It s a lot easier to deal with problems when you have adequate sleep You can just imagine a warrior in war battling without sleep compared to battling with a full night s rest it s the same with depression You re literally are fighting for your life Also hobbies help a lot with depression Gardening is very relaxing so it s a double benefit It s worth a try if you are in a legal state  Got it Thank you Got setup in it with the same usernameFor the record this blew my mind I didn t know how much of a difference testosterone could make I thought it didn t matter since I couldn t do much anymore I didn t realize how much of an impact it could directly have in daily life This comment helped the most so far Seems like you nailed that one on the head Is this something that

Carpentry and juggling were my two hobbies that got me through that shit few years That is what I started with then I guess I kinda ran out of stuff and money to keep doing it I was an industrial

almost 300k mi I started school in Jan and learned to weld but quickly noticed how much I underestimated how strenuous it was I still got something out of it though and it helped me gain 20lbs I desperately needed Thank you for your words of encouragement I too find myself wrapped up in my own thoughts  what feels like  every day Which as you said is probably one of the worst things you can do in this position Doing nothing trapped in your head with no outlet Craig helped me more than anything else in this journey because it truly heloed me understand A   How lucky I got am to even be here still B   That I m not alone and people like us still have a will and drive Thank you friend    I wish I would ve done this much sooner because I feel that I have been putting the ones who mean

and not sure what to doCan you use cannabis It doesn t take all the pain away but helps me cope with the psychological aspects of pain pretty nicely And it does dull the pain Mix that with muscle relaxers or opiates and you re well on your way to idgaf land  Are you established at a pain clinic That would be a first stop Epidurals have been a God send in the past  Unfortunately my lumbar has gotten worse and no one will do surgery on me due to my SCI at C3 C4 so I m a liability  The pain clinic is now doing a facet ablation I just got my right done on Friday I go back for the left in a couple weeks    So those are options for you that are not pain meds  I refuse all opiates so they treat me with options that may work for you     Good Luck living with pain is horrendous  I know I hope this helps you    deleted I guess maybe I should now that it s completely legal and I can pay cash  Sadly my city voted no on opening retail stores so I have to travel a bit  There s a risk here

injury but that was it Desitin Maximum  zinc  StrengthI use medline s z guard barrier cream or barrier wipes for this purpose I imagine the products you mentioned are effective as well though  I ve been using zinc diaper cream for a dry spot on my right IT and it works well   If you mean neuropathic pain it could be that covering hypersensitive areas with cream prevents them being stimulated and causing pain I used to wear long tights for that reason  it stopped the random touches of my clothes on my thighs that triggered allodynia pain   deleted Yes I meant to say neuropathic painLeaving

tips for using a wheelchair When it comes to strength it s just something you need to work on My first cruise through a Mall within 10 minutes I was winded with sore arms and had to have someone push me Now I would never dream of having someone push me Just work on building up your strength go for short  walks  and just improve from there   As for the legs falling of the foot plate My friend uses two calf straps the normal one that prevents legs from falling back and one in front to prevent his legs from falling forward He ties the strap in front really tight because he has a lot of spascity  Also  hardly anybody propels their chair  correctly   but here is how you are supposed to do it  pushing chair  https   youtu be BD9kp4u89Gc  Some people do strap their feet legs in so it might be a viable option but I can t say for sure since I ve never done it   As for tiring quickly may I ask how long you ve been a chair user  Some people keep straps on their thighs or have a stick with a loop on the end to lift their feet back on the foot rests There are also people who strap their feet together or to the chair   There are some wheelchair add ons that you can use to assist you when by yourself but they can be expensive SmartDrive power assist by MAX Mobility is one option to look into  When you relax your hands down by your sides so they re hanging down toward the ground the tip of your middle finger should be at or close to your rear axles This makes it so your chair is most efficient to propel There s exceptions to this rule for instance some folks with leg amputations would tip backward But it is a general rule of thumb  er finger  Some chairs allow the axle to be moved forward or backward It can make all the difference in the world  Bungie Cords keep my feet on the pedals and can sometimes diminish the spasms Warm up your arms to get the blood pumping start slow and as you go farther it gets easier to push Proper cushion helps also Good Luck  Foot strap is a thing I have footplate straps and a seta belt and that generally does the job for me The actual act of propelling a manual chair is just something you have to get used to   though having an energy

I don t know a lot about it so I ll leave the rest of that answer to others My personal feeling is that if I don t get anything out of it I don t care if I get it or not so aside from one attempt we haven t had sex I ve basically just dedicated myself to keeping my partner as sexually happy as I can What she wants she gets haha   No you do not lose your ability to father children though I have heard some reports of sperm getting a bit lazy after a couple years it is absolutely possible to father children I don t want them but my SO does so it s on the table still and may happen some day   It s not selfish at all to have kids It certainly needs to be considered and discussed more to be sure it really is something you both want and are both willing to sacrifice for If your level of injury is high your SO has to be aware that they are going to be doing so much more of the work But you can still be an awesome dad   As for treatment I agree people are weird about the chair You just have to remember as frustrating as people can be it s usually just because they are nervous or unsure how to act and it is always comes from a place of good intentions Even when people do really stupid things I have to remind myself that they are just trying to help People closer to me don t try to help nearly as much and I m sure the outside world has a dim view of them In fact I m quite sure a lot of people think my fiance is cruel for not helping with things when we are out in public haha The reality is if I need help I will ask and short of that moment I don t want the help   Finding a partner I can t say much I had my SO with me for 5 years pre accident and she has been nothing but perfect through all of this What I can give you is the best advice I got from a guy who had

your wife The moment your wife becomes your caregiver she is no longer your wife She can help but you have to try to do things yourself and be as independent as your injury allows     Hope some of that helps I married wife 2 after my injury  divorced too  and have probably had more interesting sex post injury  22 years injured at age 30  than I did before the injury   There are lots of tools to help with erections   drugs pump ring caverject   you need a willing partner In vitro fertilization is a reality for many SCI   To be honest I have become an oral master and have had no complaints Erection meds don t work for me so well so pump or caverject for me but my exes were into oral and I love that too so no problems   Be confident in yourself have something to offer and to hell with what other people think about you   deleted  Lot to answer here I ll try to get back to the thread when I can 50 year old c6 c7 quad with 3 kids from IVF Best thing I ve ever done These are hard and scary questions Props to you for getting out the words   I suggest posting to  https   www facebook com groups SCPSUSA   https   www facebook com groups SCPSUSA   becaue it s such an active forum I would love to see more traffic here because I personally want to decrease my FB dependency But your question deserved a quick answer     x200B     https   www christopherreeve org living with

function for men after a spinal cord injury  https   craighospital org resources sexual function for men after a spinal cord injury  Short answer is yes to both sex being possible and marriage being possible  There are much more complex and lengthy answers but that is the bottom line   I have two videos on the subject of sex  It is going to be different  most likely  after an injury but it can still be enjoyable   https   youtu be 4TaLQiiFUUY  https   youtu be otZTKucXt3A  I used to have a third video that depicted various positions that people who have had SCIs might be able to do but I removed it a while ago   Someone has since reuploaded it WITHOUT my permission    I want to make that video again for my channel but finding a willing participant has proven more difficult than I initially expected   Anyway in terms of going out and  finding someone  my best advice is to just live your life  Go about your days doing what you do  The rest will fall in line if it is meant to     You can still have a sex life It s different but it can still be fun Especially if you and your partner can be creative and adaptable Plus the intimate and emotional stuff is still possible My last partner and I could happily spend hours just kissing then I could take care of him It does take more effort to figure out what works for both people but it s possible and worthwhile      I don t think it s selfish If the other person understands that we won t have a  normal  sex life and all that and they still choose to be with me I see no problem Like I said you find different ways to satisfy a partner      I do want to have kids I don t think that s selfish either Lots of kids have disabled parents and they turn out fine For kids of disabled adults it s normal to them The shame issue doesn t seem to be super common just based on the people I know If it comes up it can be dealt with You don t have to give a child a perfect life to be allowed to be a parent In some ways my kids will have a different experience having a quad for a dad than their peers with able bodied parents will have But a different experience isn t necessarily a bad thing Kids need parents who are present who take care of their physical needs who love them and care about them and who are encouraging and supportive They need a safe stable environment that promotes growth I don t need to be able to walk to be able to do those things      I ve been paralyzed since I was 16 Both relationships that I ve had were after that and they both just happened for me pretty easily And I ve had a few other people give me their phone numbers ask me out hit on me too and all of those people were interested in me even though they knew about my disability If someone decides my chair is a dealbreaker without taking the time to get to know me as a person I don t really want to date them anyways      In my experience most people treat wheelchair users well enough I do get stared at sometimes and I don t like it but over time I stopped caring as much My peers generally treat me as an equal and my professors have the same expectations for me I have experienced discrimination before and it sucks but overall life is good  Take a look through Mount Sinai s Sexuality After SCI project https   www sexualitysci org  I helped make a great website resource on this have a look  www scisexualhealth ca It did Thank you   80 mph is 128 75 km hYour channel is pretty good C4 THROUGH 7 TATTOOSYou didnt ask for incompletes and Im lower than you  T12  but I have a ton of tattoos on my legs Healing is a little slower just need to stay vigilant and like any tattoo keep it clean but dont overload whatetver aftercare you use Your artist will recommend or have something If not I suggest Aquaphor which u can get at any Walgreens or CVS   I worked the front desk at a few different shops for like 7 years  so I m just telling you what I did  Sorry I cant give you a better perspective from your level of injury but hopefully this helps   Oh yeah the best part is you don t feel it   my artist always loved that cuz I never squirmed around from it lol  Is there much AD when getting your tattoo  C5 6 incomplete and I haven t got it done yet but me and my artist just gonna strap my leg to either the frame or something else to make sure it doesn t move if spasms hit That s maybe a little DIY though   Care and stuff I d guess just treat it like any other wound The one I have on my arm was a little slow in healing but aftercare was good so no issue  I m not op but I m an L1 incomplete and have been putting off getting to tattoos I want because I wasn t sure Thanks for your post   Also op thanks for asking Ahh the perks of the injury My biggest concern is having leg spasms while they re doing the outline   deleted Yes let us know how it goes Where abouts is the tat going On staying positiveHey man I don t know if I have anything to say that will make you feel better or if that s what you even want need right now I will say that you re not alone and a lot of people feel exactly the same as you   I consider every moment that I don t throw myself in front of a bus a victory Sometimes the only thing you can do is keep going in spite of everything that s happened   If you ever want to chat or just rant you can PM me I m T 10ish complete four years out from my accident I don t have everything figured out but fuck I don t know if anyone does I know a few people in the adaptive sports community if you think that s something you might want to pursue I can still have fun and have great outdoor experiences through my depression and chronic pain  Me to a long time psychologist  Dude if you say  rose colored glasses   one more time  Honestly come and join our  Discord  https   discord gg FVXQGKD  channel We re a compassionate group of people who over the past few months have shared some very personal stuff that helps even if all you do is lurk We re friendly and you re already welcome It s a good place to unload and know that you re already among friends who know what you re going through We may not have all the answers but we re all in similar situations and are ready to listen  I had a father son team of doctors when I was in rehab  The dad would maintain that miracles happen and it was super important to greet each day with a positive attitude and a belief that this just might be the day that you could do the hokey poky again  The son s attitude was   you re paraplegic now irrespective of your attitude so you better learn how to do paraplegic stuff  I much preferred the son s attitude   I had to tell one well meaning friend to cut the spark plug wires on his truck then pray that it would still start  If it doesn t work don t give up  Pray harder    Everyone means well  They have difficulty believing that your life has changed so much and they ve all seen too many movies that did not reflect reality in any meaningful way  In my experience if you tell people that you need them to accept the medical reality of your situation for your sake they will  Dude I am the same fucking way Just wish I could scream it all out of my system Really bothers me when I see everyone busy and I m just laying around or my bowel program literally takes so long I cant be spontaneous anymore I feel your pain my dude Shoot me but not really lol I hate it when my mom or friends are like  you ll be fine in no time cant wait til you re walking again   Dear God if only   Find something to do where you can meet other people with disabilities For me it was joining a wheelchair basketbal team The guys there first of all showed me a lot of tips and tricks about how to get through life with a wheelchair but also they understood what it s like Sometimes it just fucking sucks and pity or a  get over it  attitude just don t help Sometimes you just need to laugh about how shit it is to be disabled and you ll only really get that with other people with disabilities It s hard for people that never went through something like this to understand Seeing other people with similar disabilities that are a few years along will help you understand what your long term prospects can be in a way that cannot be communicated in words  In the nicest possible way fuck those guys  Honesty mate post injury I would and did write those exact words  I m 6 years in I wish I d found a place like this to let it all out Fucking give it some on here puke out every horrible despairing thought until you ve nothing left We hear you and we get it  Post injury I wanted to strangle my mum sometimes even though my hands don t work lol  Fuck the positivity for while and be a miserable bastard You ve earned the right   One thing I can promise you though  Nothing will ever make up for what you ve lost But there will be a day sometime in the future You will look in the mirror and you will be okay with the person staring back and the pain will be a distant memory   If and as and when your ready The peeps on here have allot of insight on the road your on If you want to know anything just ask Practical or mental Just ask   Toxic positivity  is a great way to put it  They re not allowing you to go through the grieving process which is a healthy and normal thing to start doing  You re only a few months out and you ll be healing a long time emotionally speaking  You re right you have lost something big  a future you thought you had  It s going to take time to process this loss and to figure out how you are going to move forward now that everything looks different and scary  I ve been injured 19 years and I remember something I wrote when I was only two months out   I am afraid of every crack in the sidewalk and every pile of sand I cannot move through    Also people saying things like  Only willpower will fix your spine  is particularly cruel  The intention behind it may come from a good place but it s like telling you to fix a broken leg using only your mind  There are many of us who have tremendous willpower or a great belief in God and prayer or a huge bank account to spend on rehab and fancy equipment but if your spine is damaged beyond repair none of it matters  The science just isn t there yet  It s not fair of them to put that responsibility on you  I m sure you re trying as hard as you can and doing your rehab and that s all you can do  My mom is terminally positive that one day I ll walk again She sends me every article that mentions SCI and cure in the title I don t think she reads most of them because most say that whatever new science isn t viable My friends make fun of my inability to walk and I love it     I m very sorry to read this story and that your loved ones can t or won t understand  I don t have a spinal injury due to an accident or anything but I have a very odd situation involving my spinal cord being tethered and have recently lost most of my ability to walk I m here if you ever want to rant  This is the first time I ve seen someone else put into words how I would feel about my accident happening later in life I was 24 and had just landed my dream job and I even met someone who I was sure would be the one Then it was all taken away from me I ve always wondered how different I would feel if it happened at say 40 50   The crazy thing is that reading what you posted gave me a strange sense of peace There s something about reading what others are going through have experienced etc that always helps It makes me realize that I m not alone I ve always felt extremely alone in my injury though I am never actually alone Thank you for posting  Damn bruh I feel this I m 24 and I got hurt 18 months ago t4 t5 complete a week before starting my first job out of college  I m feeling good and doing well mentally for the most part I moved out of my parents to Denver now and am independent on my own and hate pity    I feel stuck in between being strong enough to fight through the injury but also I wish I hadn t made it out of my car crash alive  I almost feel  obliged  to live and try for friends and family who had a tough time almost losing a child friend etc but I m tired also  I wonder a lot of times if this feeling is just being this age and stuck in between childhood and adulthood and just not loving that transition but who knows man    Much love and I hope you keep fighting and hope we all make it through our bad days to the better ones Did you know it takes the average person nine years to psychologically adjust to SCI Nine years This shit takes time  I m sorry the people around you suck They mean well but  what they re saying It just sucks  They need to give you a break You need to mourn  I would suggest finding a peer group to help you get through this as someone else suggested BUT I would also suggest a psychologist who specializes in psychosocial adjustment to SCI  If you meet with them and can t find a good rapport then find another If you are in a rural community with limited options consider telemedicine to find the best person to help  Your life will be very different after SCI but  even if you make no physical improvements whatsoever you can someday have a meaningful wonderful life  It won t look remotely the same as what you always imagined but it is still possible  Hey I just want to let you know that you re not alone I was 26 when I had a SCI and its never been the same While reading your post I felt like you read my mind I get exactly how it feels when you said you  hate being pitied even though I m in an extremely pitiful state   I totally understand I hope maybe in some small way that helps  Preach Brother  Fuck this injury fuck the world I d love to give every toxic positive person a knife to the spine just to watch them  positive  their way through life  Kinda late to the Party but I feel you I m also an incomplete T6 T7 and I also got injured at 24  I m now 27   Everything you said is the exact way I feel It feels like I m the one who wrote it   The part where you said that you feel like your whole life was robbed from you is the exact same thing I said to my parents Also I got my injury because someone robbed me so I really feel like I get robbed   3 years after the accident I still feel unmotivated kinda hard staying positive  Do you think life is worth living like this I ll join it but I m very introverted and shy and even though my English is good I m not a native speaker so I d feel nervous talking to you but I m gonna join as a silent lurker at least I do tell them everyday but they say it s too early to give up home I tell them that I m not giving up home since I m constantly trying my best at PT everyday but I need to plan for future The thought of living and being part of the world again is horrifying to me Wherever I go I know it s gonna be all pity and stares which is something I can t tolerate  bowel program literally takes so long  What kind of injury do you have I have a t4 t5 complete injury and I take a shit in less than 5 minutes and then don t have to shit for another day or two at the most   I do it through enemas I still poop in my diapers lolI cannot find any in my area I contacted a few on fb but they didn t respond The ones I talked to online depressed me even more because they were downplaying the gains I made I ve much better from the time of my accident and I d like to live with a little hope but all other Sci people give me is despair Your comment hit me right in the feels I just cannot take this emotional pressure People are misguiding and misleading my parents to believe that I ll be better in 3 months or so and they re so hopeful It hurts to break their heart but better sooner than later My mom is the same way she believes I ll walk some day  I ve been injured for 19 years   I used to argue with her about it but eventually I realized that it s just the only way she can deal with her pain about what happened to me  I have a lot more compassion for her and her side of things nowadays  so if she wants to believe that fine as long as she doesn t shove it down my throat Thanks for sharing this I care for a close friend  C4 quad  and we make fun of him call him the Terminator etc because of his power chair We also joke about how lazy he is just sits there while we do the chores He seems to appreciate the joking but I do wonder if we take it too far   We also talk about when the robotics get good enough and the electronics affordable how he s going to be whacking us with his future robot arms or crushing us with his future exoskeleton We never suggest that his spinal cord is fixable When people start talking about healing we start asking them if they know anyone on their local robotics program that could maybe be a future Tony Stark   We also talk about how his OT PT is just about being able to fully use what he has left I ve met some quads who work out every day and others who have given up and don t exercise Fortunately our local University has a support group and a SCI gym available Moms are irrational beings and we can t blame them It s hard to accept that your child that they raised with so much love and care can never walk or live their life fully ever again I m here too if you ever need to rant I ll feel happy if I can be of some use I ask the same question myself I think I d be much less depressed at 40 50 because by then I would have achieved most of my dreams I had literally started my life when this accident happened   There are a lot of people like us out there but unfortunately most of us are too far apart You can always talk to me if you feel like sharing something Nine years I ve never heard this figure before but it s an awful amount of time I cannot find a support group around me My accident became very famous in my area but no one reached out to me and even the ones that I contacted myself they didn t bother to respond   I also started therapy but the guy was such a moron he d talk nonsense the whole time I fixed him up real good with some of my own life philosophy lol and didn t go to him again I doubt that I can find a good therapist here manual all terrain wheelchair rental Lions Head Ontario CanadaI own one of those chairs and they re pretty amazing but you probably won t find one for rent  The distributor is in Saskatchewan  Here s his  Website  http   mountaintrikecanada ca index html  he might have some info for you  Herniated DiscI m just curious  what kind of pain   and how severe did you experience after the injury   I also hurt my back from a heavy deadlift about a week ago and I can still feel something is off with my lower back spine   I can also do pretty much everything without feeling any pain but if i bend my back forward all the way down I sometimes feel some slight stinging in my lower spine  Hey sorry for the late reply been busy with work   The pain I experienced after the injury was pretty severe I wasn t able to bend at all there was just too much pain I couldn t get out of bed I would roll off and support with my hands to get off The disc protrusion that occurred interfered with nerves going to my left leg so I got periodic cramps and those were very painful as well  eyes would start to black out   This was the first 2 weeks or so it got better slowly and I was able to do more things   I still can t bend all the way without pain I can t extend my left leg out completely anymore without the nerve getting pinched by the disc and me experiencing pain I m really careful now jumping and landing too much landing on the left side ends up causing the disc to hurt again I can t lift 30 pounds off the ground using just my back anymore gotta use everything else instead   That s kind of the gist of it I played lots of sports and worked out very often about a month before it happened when I would run on the treadmill my lower back would start to ache from simply running My physiotherapist and doctor said I likely put too much wear and tear on the discs and one of them gave way that one day during the deadlift   So I d suggest if you re experiencing pain to either stop or slow down activities avoid too much stress to your back such as jumping a lot hard running deadlifts etc The last thing you want is hurting your back because nearly all movements require your back to some extent Feel free to ask any other questions yours doesn t sound too serious yet but let s keep it that way Quadriplegics with live in CareIt depends where you live globally Depending on social services and so on  HEY my SCI Brethren Find out what happened when friends I haven t seen in 22 years see me in a WHEELCHAIR in person for the first time CHECK IT OUT  LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE A question for and about cathetersYou re asking about a foley catheter and yes they are freely available on the internet   I would strongly discourage any long term use I pretty much did it for 10 years and eroded my urethra beyond repair Now I have a port in my stomach I intermittent cath   Foleys are quite easy to use and make urinating quite simple when restrooms aren t really an option like concerts and festivals I just would stick to using them only when necessary for convenience   Weird they require professionals to insert and remove them though That s typically reserved for suprapubic catheters  I ve only had them in the hospitals but they are called Foley catheters over here I have used Foleys when travelling etc and insert and remove them myself Not really difficult to do and the most important thing is hygiene so you don t give yourself an unwanted UTI I was shown how to before I left my spinal unit after my rehab 9 years ago but I m sure YouTube will have videos to show you Should be able to buy on the internet or possibly get them prescribed by your GP or District Nurse  Good luck I use these for long distance flights Get them on the internet and I insert them myself It s easy enough if you have full use of your arms    I d advise putting them in when you have a fairly full bladder You can make sure it s inserted properly as it will move a tad when the balloon is inflated Make sure the cath is blocked though when inserting else you ll have piss everywhere    In the US a nurse can teach you how to put them in safely so that you don t inflate the balloon in your urethra and then they let you do it on your own You can order the foley style catheters with a prescription just like any other type of catheter  I am in UK also When I first came home from hospital rehab after SCI I would have a district nurse come out and change my supra pubic but as time went on I had to try it myself and in some emergency situations my district nurse showed me the ways of doing it and i ve learnt to do things a certain way to make it easier so now years onwards I change mine myself and get them on prescription   You should be able to get long lasting catheters suprapubic normal on prescription and then use them as and when you need to  do keep an eye on the expire date though  and just be careful with infections and getting pee checked out every so often you ll know all that already  Is this typical I ve been using indwelling catheters near exclusively for 10 years because otherwise I can t even cough without having to go to the toilet Yes and true the longest I had one in was three months and had an issue with continence for ages after Thanks me to and for a few months after with district nurses coming to change it every month  I ll have to investigate how I can do this over here Thanks and yes hygiene is crucial I often wash hands and use gloves I ll give it a try deleted Thanks for that and that s exactly why I d like to have some to use Thanks I ll have to ask my doctor or urologist as not sure of we can here in UKSure and thank you Guess I need a convo with urology    Hey friends I got hurt many years back before the ASIA terminology started being used Could someone explain it Look at the second page specifically at the text that s in a black box Pretty much sums it up   https   asia spinalinjury org wp content uploads 2016 02 International_Stds_Diagram_Worksheet pdf Eyy a fellow T12 incomplete   If you don t mind me asking how far along has your bladder and bowel function progressed post injury On a good day I d say both for me are back to maybe 50 60  of what they used too be but I m curious if others with an SCI at the same area have had luck with them returning back to what their functionality was pre injury  Oh thanks I appreciate it According to this I don t have an NLI and none of the scale s categories apply   I feel weird now Actually thats probably about how much mine returned Of course some days are better than others and diet helps alot  high fiber   I had my injury in summer  06 so it is what it is now but Im okay with that A lot of folks with SCI are far worse off Im lucky I can orgasm as well Do you mind if I ask if you re able to How long ago was your injury My BF is 7 weeks post injury he s probably at about the same level for bladder function He s not leaking but retaining Can feel when he has to pee but it s very difficult to start L1 incomplete which is around the same area Can you pee at all by pushing straining Do you cath and do a bowel program right now Anabolic androgenic steroidsYep a few of us did I m T5 incomplete I can move all muscle groups in right leg and foot limited in left Unfortunately my core has next to nothing so that is where I was working the hardest As I said it helped in the groups I already could  turn on  but I couldn t find anything new I saw inches in my legs chest and arms but nothing in my core Tell me your experiences did you really find new muscles How I really would love to know In my early stages I would close my eyes and mentally going through sub conscience movements like hopping out of a car or kicking a ball etc what s your approach  I ve been thinking about trying them too be interesting to know They help but it s not going to  restart  any muscles you can t already move  What positive effects did u see other than gaining some muscle size Did it improve spasticity in the areas you could move   Sorry i dont understand what u mean by finding the muscle i can just contract it but not as well as the side that is not affected by the injuryHow long after your sci did they start you on them It is very strange that most doctors have no idea and that no research has been conducted on this topic tbhDid you try it yourself I can contract and move every muscle some muscles the contraction is like 80  power instead of 100  though if that makes sense Could you tell me what the effects were for you Help Bed Suggestions for Incomplete Tetraplegic I have a temperpedic bed where the head and feet move up and down  Edit  I am a c6 c7 quad My brother is a C5 complete He is at home with us  18  He has a APM2 low air loss mattress If anyone can prescribe Juven  it s a protein supplement  and Aquacel  anti microbial wound dressing  It helped a lot Two weeks after the accident he developed a stage four from the hospital Turning him on his sides will help relieve the pressure off his bottom I hope this helps Best of luck  18  hours a day and can t turn themselves is there someone turning him   when I was in the hospital I used a Clinitron it s a bed specifically designed to not require any turning and for people to lie in 24 hours a day An oscillating air mattress  Hill Rom Envision low airloss mattresses are the ones commonly used on spinal cord units   Clinitron beds are more expensive and used on units for patients with bad wounds Clinitron beds tend to be warmer than other beds so your father could probably make do with fewer covers Insurance companies may not cover this mattress unless he has multiple high stage wounds but you d have to ask the insurance company  Look for something like this   https   www kosmochem com ProductDetails aspx CatID 244 PID 577  This is in India I think something similar might be available wherever you are I am personally using this air mattress system for over 10 years now and thankfully by the grace of God there have been no bed sores   I am a T 12 paraplegic  Like others had mentioned Ripple mattress Any appropriate bed should be fine What s important is the oscillating air mattress     going to be spending 18  hours a day in it and can t turn themselves  Advice to turn him at least once per 3 hours even though there s a ripple mattress Higher frequency is perhaps needed on the assumption that he still has bedsore   I don t have advice on embolisms no experience on that Getting him out of bed with motorized lift should become simpler with time and experience in doing it Lungs  Chest physio   Other than that be aware of autonomic dysreflexia Best of luck  I use a  Drive Med Aire 8  Alternating Pressure and Low Air Loss Mattress System  It s relatively cheap   239 on Amazon right now  and has an  alternating  setting    Initially I found it to be too firm even on the softest setting but then I discovered you can turn the dial to Soft pull the knob off and replace it pointing to Firm then turn it down again  I don t remember if I did it more than once but it s soft enough for me now  If you have the money there are beds that are rotating beds  I don t have any experience with them but I think freedom is one of the brands    I am a careperson for a C4 quad and he has sleep number bed But we don t really gain anything with being able to adjust the firmness so I say any bed that raises the head and legs would be good   He was given an oscellating air mattress overlay for the bed It reminds me of a camping air mattress but with a special pump We still had to rotate him every two hours We rotated by putting a pillow under one hip then switching it to the other four hours later We didn t rotate very far just enough to keep from lying on the same spot on his back   He didn t like how cold the air mattress made him he would wake up shivering So we decided to invent our own solution We took the pump from the air mattress and bought two sturdy inflatable pillows We attached the pump to the pillows instead of the air mattress  We put those pillows under his hips and he  rotates  every five min all night He hasn t gotten a bed sore yet and we no longer have to get up in the middle of the night   He doesn t need a protective rail because even with muscle spasms it s very unlikely that he will fall out of bed So there s not really any reason to use a hospital bed But definitely get one that can raise the head so he can sit up in bed  This does help  Is he in any kind of special bed frame or is just the mattress the important part  Do you have to turn him manually every couple of hours throughout the night or does the mattress help you out so it will  auto turn  him while he sleeps  Sorry for q s doctors really not helpful with this stuff  Yes he ll go home with a 24 hour nurse  The hope is that if the bed mattress are good enough at turning him we can pare that back to an 18 hour nurse Thank you  Will add this to the list of mattresses to investigate Thank you Thank you so much  Looking up autonomic dysreflexia now Interesting    I guess I just assumed that the firmness wouldn t matter because he has very little feeling below the neck  If it s not too personal ignorant a question  do you mind my asking    how could you tell it was too firm  You may have a lot more feeling than he does but I don t think he d be able to tell the difference between a hard and firm mattress with the exception of it were bending his neck uncomfortably  he has neck and some arm feeling but nothing below the chest  Bowel Bladder recovery The nerves to bowel and bladder rarely regain function They can be retrained and it does get a lot better with time but they are more vulnerable and most commonly affected even with incomplete injuries There are quite a few good treatments for bladder management though   botox augmentation mitrofanoff diversion etc once the neurological recovery is plateaued  It could take up to 18 months I m an L 1 and can walk without assistance short distances but never regained bowel bladder I mean she is still pretty close to when this occurred My recovery plateaued around a year afterwards  I m not saying this will help her   but it s definitely interesting and maybe worth a try This lady is a quad by the way and I just stumbled upon this video recently All the best to you both   https   youtu be K2aVWkJZfzc I am 5 years out and I recently regained partial bladder emptying based on just trying to go when I get the urge and I cath the rest It also helped when I got off all my meds Just keep trying whenever you feel like you need to go Eventually you ll see progress  Thank you This is great info Anyone else has super spastic legs Where they re either bent most of the time or super stiff straight My spasms are so bad that regular medication didn t make a dent in it I was on gabapentin baclofin Valium and muscle relaxers and I was still in the fetal position I got a baclofin pump because it was my only chance of actually being independent If it s affecting your independence pain and life I would suggest looking into it I have two possible things to try I Can tell you right now that certain strains of marijuana will work better than any medication from pharmaceutical companies If it s not legal where you live and you re not willing to risk obtaining it check out CBD oils Do some research because some of the brands are crap and don t contain what they say But that it can really help although it will be after 2 to 4 weeks of taking it every day in some cases You also might want to consider that something is causing the spasms I got medication for bladder spasms oxybutynin and by leg spasms calm down 90  Turns out my bladder was causing my legs to spasm somehow Never ask for explanations about these things with spinal cord injuries because people will just shrug We all have really unique injuries and reactions to it there is no explaining explaining Consider it could be pain somewhere you can t feel causing it   edited for grammar   Personally if I use baclofen with gabapentin it completely melts my spasms Also I know it s not a long term or everyday solution but alcohol and other  downers  usually help me out a lot Have either of those worked for you  I have pretty bad spasms as well baclofen helps a little bit I just upped the dose to 20 4x a day from 15 and I m noticing a benefit    I don t remember being told it would ever go away but it might reduce with time  The tone or stiffness is what gets me the most makes it tougher to transfer it be comfortable in bed  Sleeping prone helps some but that s good to stretch out your hips after sitting all day whether it helps with the tone or not    I wish I could ejaculate more often my legs go completely limp for about an hour afterwards that is the best relief I ve found just wish it lasted longer  I ve only ever had issues with some of my toes curling  My SCI was almost 37 years ago and it hasn t really gotten any worse in the past 15 20 years  Became a quadriplegic in 1991 I was taking the maximum amount of baclofen and valuim for about a year and my spasms were still pretty bad Ended up getting a baclofen pump in 1992 and I haven t had spasms since Life changer for sure  Sadly a pump isn t really an option for me since it isn t available in my country yet I second this Medical marijuana is the only thing that s ever helped my spasms it s about 3 years since my injury for me I have the worst spasms compared to anybody that I ve seen in the clinic and fitness centers that I ve attended I was taking 80 mg of baclofen a day Currently weaning off of it    Unfortunately there s a lot of crap products out there and I tried three different brands of CBD oil that did nothing for me I still believed in the plant because I know it is medicine so I decided to grow my own ever since making my own CBD edibles I ve been able to actually get a decent amount of sleep before CBD edibles I would wake up every 30 minutes because of my spasms Now I can sleep through the night and only wake up when my bladder is full   definitely do your own research If I were to recommend a brand of CBD oil I would recommend Lazarus naturals I ve read a lot of good things about them plus they give a pretty steep discount for people with disabilities I believe it is 70  so it s definitely worth a try If you try something that does not work I would still continue to look four different companies or if you have the means to grow your own Everybody that I ve talked to you that has tried medical marijuana does get some kind of relief from it Good luck on your journey Message me if you have any questions I wish I could but marijuana is a big no no in my country I would get shot right then and there if I m caught I m not sure if even CBD oil is legal here I ll check it out though I stopped taking Oxybutinyn because of its serious long term side effects on cognition Basically starts making you demented after a while Permanent damage too so it doesnt reverse if you stop taking it I think I ve seen one of your videos discussing about your toes Sadly there s no baclofen pump procedures in my country yet SCI Poser You re being silly This isn t a contest for what is and isn t an sci  deleted  I completely feel you I m T12 incomplete but can somehow still walk I have numbness throughout my legs and can t feel anything in my pelvic region and I ve got zero bowel bladder but even still I only lurk here rather than contribute because I feel like a complete poser   I have learned some really great b b tips from this sub as well as lifestyle improvements for traveling pain management etc  so please stick around Like the other guy said it s not a contest  I stopped going to my local SCI support group because I felt maybe similar to you I got tired of listening to the paraplegics bitch about stuff I could only dream of doing and yet I had no room to complain about my life compared to those with higher level injuries in the same room as me I felt  lucky   in comparison Even though I have a cervical injury being incomplete means I can tell when I should be doing weight relief can enjoy a foot massage and have early warning of bowel movement Yet it doesn t spare me from a lot of extra unnecessary pain too   Maybe if your single only solitary problem is that you need a wheelchair and everything else is hunky dory  No biogenic bladder and bowel no sexual dysfunction no spasticity   Maybe then I would tell you to get bent Until then I am happy to consider you one of my brothers Just don t expect me to get all glassy eyed over your stories about how difficult it is to find decent accessible parking these days    We re all in this together I m not injured but I m here to learn from everyone as I raise a daughter who has a SCI  I m an incomplete L2 and I ve healed a bit in the past few years Just because your injury isn t as severe as what some others have that doesn t make it   or you   any less valid    I hardly  qualify    Spinal cord injury is spinal cord injury Pretty much all of them lead to significant neurological deficits Even if those are not immediately obvious to a casual observer they always are for the patient   My injury is C5ish and tumor induced and a casual observer wouldn t notice any obvious symptoms But I have to pass on any activity that requires two fully functional arms or legs and while the tumor has not shown any signs of growth in decades there is no guarantee that the little time bomb won t go off in the future  Thats crazy man Like another poster said its not a contest If you have damage to your spine then you have a spinal cord injury Thats the facts Thats it Saying otherwise is like saying  I know 1 1 2 but I just dint feel like it really does   It doesnt matter if thats your feeling Facts is facts  You definitely are not a poser We all piss the same way  Through a tube or pissing on ourselves   Edit  spelling Theres always gonna be someone worse off than you unless youre dead  and even then not really  I think we have preconceived notions about what  real  disability is   You have a SCI Thus you aren t  a poser  Yes of course there are a variety of types and levels and severities but that doesn t mean you re faking it or somehow not real   I lurk here on off even though I don t have the type of classical injury or backstory most associate with SCI   I have Adhesive Arachnoiditis and Tarlov cysts both likely resulting from a selective dorsal rhizotomy  which also necessitated multiple laminectomies  from L1 S2   This injury results in the same sort of neuro sensory motor issues you d see in someone who d gained an SCI from an accident except that long term it s progressive and outcome unknown But essentially due to mechanical damage from surgery my spinal nerves are scarring together and slowly dying   Some days I walk a little indoors some days I roll from the moment I get out of bed and some days I struggle with my bladder and bowels and wonder if today s the day the nerves short out completely I struggle with blood circulation and skin integrity issues  C1 imcomplete here I m okay with not being real then LolL4 S5 incomplete sacral meningocele here I can also walk but get a good 8 10 pain when I do as well as nerve issues and small relentless spasms   I m just wondering what it s like for you to walk Do you have any sensation How do you walk  Sounds like a stupid question  but I ask because I m looking for further adaptations to walking and am interested in how you ve adapted I m going for a tilite wheelchair fitting on Friday Can t wait   All them fat lazy bastards taking up our parking spot There s a reason why the handicap signs have a logo of a wheelchair not a fat tittied man This made me smile much more that it really should Thanks for that Any med student quads I read this thread when I was recently injured and there is a lot of good info about being a quad in med school  It is a very long thread though   It reads more like a journal   by the father of someone who had an accident and became a quad  He started posting in 2007 and is still writing updates   http   sci rutgers edu forum showthread php 77419 Recent Accident to My Son I m a T9 currently at uni in the UK so not going to be completely helpful but I have seen a couple of quadriplegics around campus There s a student support unit and I was assigned a particular person to contact about any issues who has been helpful all the way through I do neuroscience so have done a few labs and people always assist so it s never been a problem but I m sure it ll be different for you     x200B   I have a blind flatmate who has someone help her through campus and also know someone with a personal notetaker I was also given a recording program for lectures so I have my own personal recordings of each lecture     x200B   Regarding school or student bias people are always really helpful and friendly You will get a few stares which can be annoying but it s more curiosity than anything else If I see someone else in a wheelchair it is less than usual so I d probably have a glance too     x200B   Sorry I can t be more help with the medschool aspect of things but if there s anything more general relating to college feel free to message me any time I d be happy to help  I m 10 years post SCI with a T5 complete Hardly your level of injury but I went through all of med school and now residency with my injury Let me now if there s anything I can help answer   As for notes record the lectures and then dictate your notes You should get used to dictating anyways As a resident when I m carrying 10 12 patients I easily create 100 pages of documents per day If you can t type you ll be dictating  Good times   As for school and students they ve treated me exactly how I present my self If I break down and act helpless I ve been treated like that But if I present as a badass that occasionally needs help solving a few problems I get treated like a badass   Charles Krauthammer  https   en wikipedia org wiki Charles_Krauthammer  was similarly injured in a diving accident while in med school He went on to become a clinical psychiatrist and then later transitioned to a career as a prolific author and highly esteemed intellectual     x200B   As far as taking notes goes Dragon Naturally Speaking is the leading software out there for dictation If you re a C5 you should be able to move your arms so wrist brace and stylus will work well with a touch screen tablet School can and will make accommodations such as giving you extra time asking students teachers to share notes You need to find their ADA Compliance contact which should be available through your Guidance Counselor  Thank you No apologies needed I appreciate your words brotherYeah Ive been watching boards and beyond videos and trying to dictate notes for practice It s just very different from writing notes but I suppose the more I do it the more I will get used to it Pressure sores and neuropathic painYou  can  bounce back In the past two years I ve spent four months flat on my back in a air fluidized bed at the VA after flap surgeries first the right buttock in 2017 and then the left buttock in 2018 Did I suddenly forget out to shift and do pressure releases after 36 years as a para No  my bursas simply failed The doctor said there was nothing I could have done I was filled with furious anger over my body s betrayal but the surgery and subsequent rehab held out the promise of a life continuing  normally   A year after my last flap surgery I m livin  large doing whatever I want to do   The two times I went into the VA for the surgery and rehab I told myself to treat it like I did eight weeks of bootcamp  Hard sometimes illogical and not the real world I went through the time without watching the calendar focusing simply on making progress   It helps to have wound care specialists who know what they are doing I tried a doctor outside the VA who was a board certified wound care specialist But she had only treated one paraplegic and that wound was on the stomach I spent more than three months trying to avoid the surgery the VA said I needed The last time I spoke to the doctor she told me that I d need surgery Thanks doc I could have listened to the VA and by now I d be done with this shit   If you heal that wound correctly you can move forward  I ve had two serious ones that required surgery and definitely bounced back afterwards with less pain I would always recommend people seek medical advice as soon as possible and if surgery is required to do that sooner rather than later  Echo others with massive empathy for how much pressure sores suck I m a complete T12 L1 para I ve had a sacral pressure sore for twenty years and had flap surgery once It s currently closed but it s always tenuous and I narrowly avoided surgery recently by spending about a month on my stomach  as much as possible I used an exercise ball  took protein supplements and only sat in my RIDE custom cushion that I had rechecked to make sure I wasn t making any contact   I m aware that I am super lucky to have it currently closed and now that I m 40 I have to be crazy careful and keep my weight low but not too low since my ass is bony enough already I also had to give up using an arm bike which was how I got cardio exercise that really helps me mentally and heart health wise I was rocking too much on my sacral area Haven t found a replacement for good cardio that doesn t exacerbate the sacral area yet but oh well   As far as pain goes I used both gabapentin and neurontin along with CBD to manage my pain without frying my brain like opioids do Best of luck to you Bodies can do amazing things I m hoping yours rallies soon  I had a surgery but unfortunately it broke down again after 6month The surgeon refused to do any more surgery as they said it has a big risk of failing again as I had no muscle left in the area to cover the wound Now all I do is daily dressing with silver hydrofibre packing It really tiring that I have to spent lot of time and money for the wound care   Earlier this year the bone beneath the wound got infected and I had a antibiotics infusion for 6 weeks Do you guys have any suggestions for a good tissue generating agent or woundcare I plan to seek a medical attention from different hospital which will for sure cost me a dime soon But between that hopefully I can manage the wound from getting bad or infected UTIs and infections and muscle weakness Thank you so much for your reply She did go cold turkey per her doctor which I agree is not good She is in the hospital and hopefully will get the cultures back soon and get her strength back In the meantime I m going to be working to get her braces so when she gets back to rehab which she WILL Rehab has done wonders and I just can t wait until she gets through this bout  UTIs can cause a whole host of really bizarre symptoms  Hard to say for sure either way though  Sorry I can t be more helpful  Not a doctor but here some thoughts Antibiotics can be really strong and can cause side effects like dizziness You didn t mention the order that the things occurred in your post above but if she was placed on a strong antibiotic  like Flagyl metronadizole  that can definitely cause dizziness   The other thing is  did she wean her antidepressant or did she stop it cold turkey Always always always wean that stuff down It works on the chemicals in your brain and stopping it cold turkey a cause a bunch of crazy symptoms   So I m wondering if the antibiotics caused dizziness and then she stopped the antidepressants and that caused different symptoms like hot flashes and high blood pressure Just a thought   I hope things get better for her Sounds like she was making great progress  C5 Quad travelling to the states from ausWhere exactly will you be visiting  Superior Van   Mobility is one option Be prepared to spend  120 day  Don t use wheeler  Terrible service and broken vans  CaliforniaI have used their service as well You will get the adaptations necessary In my case it was a van with a lowered floor side entry power ramp 6 way power seat spinner knob and push rock hand controls They are a bit on the expensive side though Yeah na thats a bit steep   Love the  username   significant Spasticity advice Hi there My BF is currently in rehabilitation 6 weeks post injury and I just ordered him some CBD oil It s supposed to be excellent for muscle spasms I wish you both all the best  Could you please list the medication he is on  Baclofen is an excellent medication to help with significant spasticity It s one that had helped me tremendously Maybe discuss this with his doctor   Oh oops I just saw the list of meds Normally they don t add a muscle relaxer on top of baclofen but I m also on tizanidine It works in the nervous system  I could also recommend that  I have struggled terribly as well  I guess I could also add that they referred me to botox injections but because of the nature of my injury they weren t willing to risk complications  He may be able to do those as well  Medical marijuana is the only thing that has helped my spasms I take 80 mg of baclophen a day and it does not give me the relief that MMJ does Make sure you find a reputable company though A lot of fake and weak products out there be careful  Oral Baclofen helps a lot but I kept having to increase dosages I ended up getting a Baclofen pump which injects a smaller amount directly into the spine and it has made my life so much better I was the exact same way and my legs would stick straight out I have almost fallen out of my wheelchair The doctor told me that maybe only a quarter of oral Baclofen actually gets into your system   I also recommend weed if you can get it legally A lot of people that say it doesn t help are probably trying the wrong strains I tried one called Sour Tsunami a long time ago that was perfect I haven t found anything quite as good as that As for CBD oil it didn t really help me by itself The weed with THC and CBD combo helped much more  The weed really helped me get off a few meds and you can probably do the same I was able to completely get off of oxycodone Ambien and was able to decrease Baclofen and my anti depressant It s absurd how many pills they prescribed me out of the hospital   Good luck to you guys I know much of what you are going through and I wish I knew about this sub when I had my accident If you have any questions please pm me  It will almost certainly ease in the coming months He should probably be on baclofen and dantrolene dantrium now Beware it s gonna make him super drowsy for about a week till he adjusts Don t let him lay in bed or it won t get better That ll knock down the spasms but in about 2 years when you ve had a chance to get a new normal established look into baclofen pumps They go under the skin and they are super effective while using so much less medication The result is few spasms no pills to take forget and no drowsiness   Hang in there I promise if he s willing to work at it this thing gets better  I had terrible spasms for the first maybe 5 or 6 months I have 20mg of baclofen 3 times a day and stretch most mornings I m C5 Asia A I m not sure what other advice to give it just got better for me over time I also tried CBD oil and smoking marijuana but it didn t seem to help the spasms that much but it was fantastic for sleep although most people say different for the spasms  Max out on oral baclofen  or stop if he gets too tired  then he should consider an Intrathecal baclofen pump He should talk to his SCI physician   Botox is another possibility but with diffuse spasticity in four limbs you won t be able to inject enough for a satisfactory effect  Thank you See my post to OP just in case it s new info that might help Good luck to you and all my best    link  https   www reddit com r spinalcordinjuries comments bokci6 significant_spasticity_advice enjj9ze deleted Absolutely baclofen midodrine zanaflex xarelto buspar Prozac juvin alphalipoic vitamin b complex magnesium vitamin d and a sleeping med but I have to check the name he just switched it but his spasms haven t changed since the changeI was on methocarbomal at the same time as baclofen Just really hard on your organs Thank you I ll check in with it Thank you so much What products would you suggest Getting harder to transferInfection like cdiff caused that to happen to me  any other weird shit going on not transfer related  How long have you been injured   My body does weird and annoying crap with my bottom half when I have an infection cut bruse my back gets stiff and it makes it hard get a full push sometimes  I always thought this was the norm tho but to each their own I had a UTI last week got some antibiotics and cleared it up Other than that everything else is normal It s been 2 5 years  Hopefully that s just what it is time will tell but I m going to go see a doc this week just in case What do you do with Catheters you no longer need  Suprapubic  If you re interested in donating them Project Cure takes unused medical supplies it s what hospitals in CO use  I ve regularly thought about this I ve had so much stuff over the years just stored that I have never got around to using or bought something for a situation or received something on prescription that I ve not used every single thing in a multiple prescription Plus I am always conscious of how much some of this stuff costs and would love to give it away or on to someone else that wants or more importantly needs it In the UK the pharmacists won t take it back local gp surgeries will take  some  stuff to use in other patients situations  unopened unused dressings for example    I ve not found anything but a version of a  food bank  but for medical supplies that could be donated given to people in need of it would be a great thing but i m not aware of anything similar to this  I m from Alabama and I would love to donate the red ones but the others were quite expensive but I ll most likely be left with no choice They are 11  each and I have over 180 of them Hell I d be happy with 2  each but don t know where to sell or even tryGetting two vertebrae in neck fused on Thursday   Massive spasticity todayI take 40 mg of baclofen every six hours  8 mg of tizanadine Settles me right down  Only advice is to be sure you need surgery There are no backsies  Do you have Valium You can up your baclofen but it ll take a while to really work  Alternative is Dantrolene if you re not responsive to baclofen  Thank you for input   I think that the extreme contractions are because the previous day was so draining   4 hour pre op consultation and 5 bus rides on a hot day really tired me   Gonna chill out today Orgasm   bladder gives inTry botox in bladder  Orgasm L 1 somehow living without that Lol You can get plastic mats with a cotton absorbent topping that stops what you mention I have them under my bed sheets just in case and can wash whilst sat on them too Very handy and easy to find Search incontinence mats or bed mats  Try CBD It helps my spasms tremendously Might help it might not  it s worth a try If you can t solve the issue I say just have towels handy  Sometimes the gf squirts a lot so we tend to be prepared for a mess  Just a thought but have you considered that it s not pee but female ejaculation Because you said you go right before it s hard to imagine your bladder fills up THAT much and that quickly in such a short amount of time Hmm  It would definitely be life changing But I don t have 700    I m also scared that it would make peeing very difficult Already I can t pee spontaneously instead I have to squeeze certain muscles That sucks man have you talked with somebody about that Thank you Sounds really good Good suggestion It might at least help with my spasms tooIn my case a few towels aren t enough  What goes everyone do for work career I m a project manager I had a desk job before I broke my back and went back to it Luckily I had a great employer who were willing to keep me on   In theory any desk job is ok in a wheelchair Don t think disabled jobs think of desk jobs  I m an engineer I do most of my job on the computer  I work in service and resource navigation for people with physical disabilities at a large assisted living organization Studied social service work then disability studies and volunteered my butt off that whole time I purposely chose this field and got picky about where I volunteered so that I could use my disability as an advantage It s worked out pretty well so far Would recommend  CAD Designer using Solidworks most of the time Sales mainly  Also it s better to do something than nothing leave your pride at the door initially Quality Control for a television production company  Following this thread out of interest My SO is a fisherman and suffered a L1 burst fracture He doesn t really have any idea what to do for work now  Try volunteering with a charity Or just ask what is required to volunteer Kids elderly poor   there is always someone who needs your help  I am an office support person in a probation office It s a desk job handling files and paperwork Engineer Though I have to leave the soldering to my EE colleagues as it is hard to solder todays grains of sand with one healthy and one lame hand  My boss is a tech writer in IT company As far as I can see he could do any job here if he devoted his time to develop necessary skills  from software development to managing projects to managing people  Not a career yet but I m a premed student   Since breaking my back I ve nannied worked for event services on campus  ticketing events and setting up for events I usually just stick to box office  swim coaching and I just got a job as an awake overnight assistant for a home with four adults with intellectual disabilities  Can I ask what your job entails more specifically My undergraduate degree has an emphasis in CAD and I learned on Solidworks in school Since then I have learned fusion 360 and use that while I volunteer at the nearby university I am curious how I can better use this toward a career Quads who vape MMJ independently  some vaporisers have apps controllable using hands or switch control then attach a tube near your mouth and even C4 and up should be able to do this yourself Quads helping other quads smoke weed I love it I ve apparently been doing this all wrong Which one of those two has the ability to be turned on off completely with an app  Vaporizers like the PAX and the Crafty have mobile applications where are you can adjust the settings Getting back into life27 months from the accident I was working part time Now I m FT That took 24 months   I was in hospital for 13 months  I m a Quad and it took me about 2 years to essentially get past a lot of my issues I had no interest in wheelchair activities and sports and to this day I still really don t have much of an interest in that I m 8 years in However I wish that I was a little more receptive to that I think my reason is due to my injury being higher up I understand his injury is a little lower and hand function should allow him to still go fishing and other activities Something that really helped was going back to work part time at Best Buy I was able to basically get a chance to be on my own for a little bit and selling and helping customers kept my mind off of any depressing thoughts I know that was one of my issues I always had someone with me and just wanted to be alone sometimes However if I was completely alone I would sometimes fall into a funk Another thing that did help was simply working out whether it was at a gym or going to the park  Where are you located There are charities that provide peer mentoring and in the up the charity Back Up does a multi activity course for people with SCI covering all kinds of outdoor activities They even have sit skiing courses There s a lot that can be done outside still and it would be a shame for your boyfriend to lose that unnecessarily if there s help out there to improve his life  if you have a local chapter of  United Spinal  http   unitedspinal org   they might have some events where your BF can try various activities modified for sci  For example our local chapter has an expo where the sci person can try hand cycling kayaking adapted fishing bowling and get in contact with other organizations that offer hunting outings for various disabilities  as well as try out various other equipment from supporting manufactures  like track chairs etc   It is a good way to get ideas and figure out what interests him  There are also other members that can inspire him to get out there   we have a couple members that still compete in motorcross and go skydiving   My wife  quad  has been hunting many times  as well as target shooting  goes handcycling when we have time and kayaks  I would recommend stopping by our  discord  https   discordapp com invite FVXQGKD  channel It s not especially active but it s a good place for honest talk about well anything  Getting back into life will obviously be different for everyone  I m paralyzed from the chest down and fortunately it happened when I was 13  When you re that young you really don t know who or what you are  I just went with the flow I grew up in a rural area where there wasn t much to do  I went to school and that was about it  I played video games and hung out with my two best friends at the time  It s a constant learning experience  You find new challenges and you discover ways to tackle them  I m now 34  I went to college have had a number of jobs got married got divorced am currently engaged to the love of my life and we have a beautiful 17 month old daughter  I live a very normal life  I go to work every day I have great friends my life is normal aside from the fact that I can t walk  Being a parent now I spend a lot more time at home but before that I regularly went out to the bars concerts vacations all the normal things  I still do that just not as often since we have the toddler in our lives   As others have suggested look into groups in your area there s tons out there that you don t ever hear about until you look  When I was in high school I would go to the Shriners Hospital in Chicago every 6 months for check ups and they had tons of programs for SCI kids  I went to an SCI summer camp  One year they took me and 7 others down to the Florida Keys where I became a certified scuba diver through a program called Dive Heart  One of my favorite bartenders has a family who has a hunting program called Twist of Fate where they take disabled hunters out each year and go on a big hunt  I ve never taken part in it but growing up in a rural area hunting was a big thing  I haven t hunted in years but I filled my deer tag 3 or 4 seasons while in high school  I bet if you look you ll find tons of programs in your area  And if that s not his thing that s ok  I personally don t care for a lot of programs that cater to handicap individuals  Don t get me wrong they re great but like I said my life is damn near normal aside from not being able to walk  I don t need their assistance and would rather not take away resources from those that do    Life after an SCI can be great it may just take time  The human spirit adapts very well when you let it  Things will feel like normal in time  Does he do therapy That s a great discussion to have with him or her  It really depends a lot on his limitations  I m 3 years out and there s still things I m not out doing  I have good days and bad days  I go to therapy twice a week which helps tremendously  My life changed completely though and there s a ton of things I did I ll never do again sadly  That s why I say he ll have to talk through some things  depending on his injury  It can be jarring when you discover you can t  but on a positive note he may discover new activities he loves trying new things that accommodate his injury  It can be complicated  I was injured in March 2018 and that s my biggest struggle he s lucky he has someone like you encouraging him things will normalise after a while for us I m sure  The first year is the hardest after the first year is when I really started to feel like I m back to life  It is different now of course but many things are the same and I do a lot of things  I ve been sit skiing boating fishing took 22 flights last year for work and pleasure honeymooned in Hawaii went to Mexico with friends and just got an off road hand cycle to get back in the mountains Check out high fives foundation they provide lots of opportunities to get back outdoors  They are mainly on the west coast but have been expanding  If you have any questions or want to bounce ideas feel free to reach out to me  Do you mind if I ask what you do Our injury levels are similar but having even a part time job seems extraordinarily daunting Thank you We re located in the southeast US I see that Back Up is in the UK but it s possible that we could still benefit from the info so I will check this out I ll also do some research about mentors or groups close to us He was at Shepherd Center for rehab but it s a bit far and he didn t really connect with anyone there   I just want him to still enjoy his life Sex after sciI m a c6 7 incomplete quad If you think you are ready for it go for it I was about 6 months out when I started having sex again Don t get disappointed though I know I was and it wasn t even because I didn t have much sensation down there It was a problem with maintaining an erection I tried cock rings and even a pump but they only lasted a few minutes I finally broke down and talked with my urologist and got a prescription for Viagra I take 50mg an hour before sex It definitely takes me at least an hour for it to absorb into my system If you don t want to talk with your doctor I recently got my Viagra prescribed through blinkhealth for just  5 and then the generic pills were only about  2 each  shipped  which is a lot cheaper than the brand name and they honestly work just as good Also I use a Hitachi magic wand to help with ejaculation if you have any problems with that I just had my first kid about a year ago and it s amazing My wife basically has to deal with two kids now though   Another thing sex is still great for me even though I don t have a lot of sensation Foreplay kissing and the Viagra really helped If you live in a state where weed is legal I would try it for a few different reasons but it has made sex so much better for me I just started smoking vaping about 4 or 5 months ago and I swear it amplified the sensation down there  See what works and what doesn t work If you are having a hard time maintaining an erection then talk to a SCI sexual health nurse and either try oral medication or injectables Cock rings also help   Don t give up You have a new body so it ll be different You ll see what feels good and what doesn t Have patience   Also if you get AD when going to town Stop Heard of AD happening when people are about to cum Don t want to get a lightening headache for the next while our potentially stroke out   If you want to explore there are some vibrators massagers that have higher success rate to make you ejaculate There are also centres that can help with ejaculation and insemination so having kids is still possible   At six months your bone should have fully healed by now but unless your doctor said not to have sexy time If you re not sure because we re just random people on the internet best to squash the fear curiosity by asking your trusted SCI doctor   Feel free to PM  There is no good time it s when you feel ready for it I m a T 4 incomplete but I m a chic so  can t help completely but  I say try and see what happens I think it s safe  as long as you re safe  for your body when you think you re ready It will be different so bear that in mind and have fun I d pay attention to things like enough lube to stop any  friction burn  or whatever you want to call it If you have symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia like I do than definitely pay attention to that I d be by myself before I d try being with someone else as well To see how that has changed if it has Then go from there good luck be safe and have fun Go for it man     I ll always remember my doc muttering the imortal phrase  if you don t use it you ll lose it    It s all new and weird hopefully you ll find a way  I use Cialis or Viagra   I m C5 incomplete 5 yrs My partner is one month post injury  L1 incomplete  and we ve gave it a try already Go for it  You can have sex when you re ready for it There is no time frame The more you use it the better you will get My nurses and doctors told me that after my injury and they were right  I don t think there is any specific time as long as you feel ready I think results are different for everyone but there s certainly ways around them   I have read that using assistive devices can cause issues like high blood pressure so that s something to look into Maybe  Did you mention your SCI in your consultation with blink A lot of the multiple choice answers aren t super relevant I mean health wise is it safe How would I know that my body is ready for it The future is  Interesting Gonna need some bigger doors for ADA regs  Where we are going we don t need  doorsTrying to feel comfortable asking for help in stores and other placesPeople ask help for many reasons They can ask for directions help pulling a thread through a needle help lifting something Asking for help doesn t mean you re incompetent weak or anything negative It just means you need help at one little thing Nothing more And most people love to help others Next time you might be the one helping them   Maybe I m reading this all wrong and you don t feel like you should be able to do everything yourself But if you do feel that way you don t need to I bet even a renaissance man like da Vinci needed help sometimes  I think it s something you have to just get used to I ask people for things all the time At some point my embarrassment for having to get help was overcome by the annoyance of having to plan on only getting things I could reach I ve felt more  pity  from others when I m struggling to get something off a high shelf than I ever had from asking for someone to grab something Now don t get me wrong I always try and get it first unless it s something I know I can t reach  looking at you glass bottles of hot sauce on the top shelf    It s not dumb  I was injured 19 years ago  2 years post injury I could have written this post  It took me a long time to be OK with asking for help and some days I m still not OK with it   I m an introvert and some days I just don t want to interact with people not even to just ask them to reach something  and some people seem to think I owe them a conversation in return  Or sometimes I don t want to see the condescending look on their face or hear that tone that can come into their voice  I m also very independent and I don t like needing others or feeling vulnerable  Some days I will leave the store without getting that jar from the top shelf at all   And some days I m feeling confident and or normal and I m fine with asking for help  Some days I welcome the exchange of smiles and pleasantries and I can feel good about knowing that people often feel good about helping little ol  me   Be patient with yourself  It s understandable to not be OK with asking for help especially in the early years  Start slow and small  But I would advise practicing because it really does make your life easier in the long run  Try to think of it less like asking for help and more like delegating if that makes it any better  everyone needs help sometimes   it gets easier to swallow your pride especially when you want to eat something on the top shelf As with most new things change can be tough With a little practice you ll see that it s okay to ask for help   Keep in mind that it s part of a clerk s job to assist customers So if asking other shoppers nearby worries you start small with the clerks  Totally agree with the other posts  But  I get all my bits delivered  I fucking hate supermarkets Does masturbation or navel play promote urinary incontinence in anyone here Not for me atleast you sure it s not just because you re getting older Older men have to pee more often it usually starts in your thirties Have you looked into getting botox injections in your bladder It has made my life 10x better  Dude I thought I was the only one If I get super horny watch porn or jerk off I know I m going to leak later I have never experienced  naval play  or anything like that making this occur though  If I m watching porn or something even if I cathed twenty minutes before I ll have to pee during and I ll probably leak after  Well I have been told by older men that after age thirty even able bodied men can leak a little I am thinking of getting botox shots However I am concerned that it will affect my ability to have orgasms  So far I only have what I think are orgasms I still can t ejaculate at least not by what I can do with my hands Maybe it will be possible with a vibrator I ll have to ask the doctor for a prescription for a FertiCare or something  I have worn pull ups for a number of years due to me leaking since some fusions in my spine broke after my rods were removed due to an infection  and due to the broken fusion I also wear a TLSO Last November I wondered how I could take care of myself if for whatever reason I had to remove my pull up without having another one handy  and this lead me to seeing how well I could manage going without a pull up for the remainder of the day I discovered that I could actually go the entire day without any accidents which means that whatever caused my leaking when my fusions first broke must have gotten better In the months of November and December I only had three accidents   However while I had been touching myself for some time before November I also started touching myself much more in these two months In my case it does not seem like masturbation immediately makes me start wetting myself like it does in your case Instead masturbation seems like it is something that I have to do for a while before it begins to catch up with me  and it seems like it will be something that I will have to quit for a while before I can expect to have dryer pants Off road wheelchairThat is bad ass  Hehehe metro hates me as it is if I get this unit with my high end motors    It is on and cracking   This is on the someday when we re rich  ha  list Hahahahaha  I m only seeing about 20 degrees of tilt How do you avoid pressure sores if you re in the chair all day  How much did this beast cost   Lean forward to do a pressure relief and driving around on rough terrain will move me around enoughJust did my own quote under 12000 damn that s not bad It starts at just over  11 000 and goes up from there depending on the style of chair and the add ons you getQuads who are  80kgs do you go air travelling How is it done if you do   Half of both arms have motor   sensation   If your arms show any neurological deficiencies from the SCI  quad Hey there I m a c5 6 quad bout 80kg  and have bout the same feeling function as you  I ve flown a fair few times domestically in Australia and also over to Las Vegas most of the time here they ll manually lift u into the narrow isle chair at the boarding gate just prior to everyone getting on Once inside they either manually lift u into the chair  armrests lift up  or when I flew virgin to LV they used a eagle hoist which worked quite well https   youtu be uTPItEfxSeE  Make sure you emphasise that your butt can not be be bumped dragged scrapped etc any stage as this can lead to bruising and a pressure sore Also take too gel out of your cusion n put on the plane seat for some protection I think roho have a small air cushion for travelling which I m going to look into It s great fun traveling have a go  Simple distinction between quads and paras is injury level If you broke your neck  C level  you are a quad if you broke your back you are a para  I m 64 kg and do the 2 person lift you describe  If you have a gait belt around your chest I suppose you could have 2 lifters behind you with one of them standing in the farther row s foot space  Or just wait for the really big baggage handler   Two person to lift There is a thing you can put under you with two handles on each side and it makes the lift much easier Belt across the chest helps Get in the front seat so you have lotsa room in front of you It can be done My dude is 200lbs and 6 4   You can use the Eagle 2 lift it s in all Canadian airports and many internationally It s a hoist made for planes It lifts you out of your chair and they roll it down the aisle and then it fits neatly over your passenger seat and lowers you down into it   You will need to avoid long flights or make plans for managing your bladder The in flight aisle chairs aren t easy for big people If you re travelling with someone they could just empty your leg bag into a plastic bottle and dump it for you in the lav  Because my local hospital  not from US  seems to define quad as complete paralysis of all 4 limbs  Heard once or twice a doc refer me as tetra which I remember reading that it s the same as quad And in the end it s shown as para in the medical record which I felt kind of undermines my SCI s seriousness I m actually a C5 6 as well Just thought I should describe my condition as thoroughly as possible to determine its quad or para Seems like it is just that my local hospitals were the one that decided to have different definition instead   Eagle hoist seems very simple wonder if the airlines airports of my country has it I m mainly concerned with manual lifting Afraid I would be too heavy for them Maybe it s still doable at the boarding gate with more helping hands But once inside the aircraft which is not wide I m afraid with only 2 person they couldn t carry me to my seat Best would be for the airlines airports to have this eagle hoist you mentioned I guess     It s great fun traveling have a go   Yeah Hope my time comes soon  DIt s a C level injury But my local hospitals somehow decided to have different definition I guess   So I m a para in my records   Air Compression CirculationMy dad has a SCI and uses them on and off They helped with the circulation and kept the swelling down He also wears long compression socks at night  Reliable SUV conversion I ve done a fair bit of research into this and I recently  November 2018  purchased a Freedom Motors Silverado Conversion Some of the information I have may not be correct but it s what I understand to be the case   GoSichi was the first truck suv converion on the market like this GoSichi was purchased by SVM at some point The guy who started GoSichi then started ATC SVM meant under during a period of time that a LOT of people were having issues with the electronic linear actuators Freedom Motors then acquired SVM GoSichi and begun selling conversions that were hydraulic  like ATC had moved to  and far more reliable   You can differentiate the ATC conversions from the Gosichi SVM Freedom conversions by the door Only ATC has a gull wing seat the others are all slide outs doors I actually prefer the slide out because it requires less room to open and while the gullwing offers some elemental protection I believe it s not as great as they claim due to the A pillar sweep Still the gullwings look cool as heck   So anyway that s the history as I understand it I had been looking at both ATC and older SVM models but really wanted a newer all hydraulic ATC model initially When I found my truck I learned that Freedom had actually take my truck in on trade and had gone through the entire system and converted it from electronic actuators to hydraulic I had an issue on Christmas day when my carelessly placed smart drive caught in the opening door wire loom that travels behind the hydraulic ram arm and it ripped out a few wires from the harness At 6 30pm on Christmas Day the foreman of the assembly lined called me and helped me and my girlfriend s step dad troubleshoot it and got it all fixed up  a single wire in one of the lift sensors pulled out  Apart from this and issues with my Q lock  not Freedom s fault  I ve not had any major issues with my truck in the last 5 months and about 5000 miles I know that s not saying much but at this point I think I d be happy purchasing a vehicle from either ATC or Freedom My experience with Freedom has been rather smooth and reliable   I hope that helps some  I ve had a Ford MXV for a year now So much better than my old van  Thanks a lot for all the feedback That builds on what I already knew as far as the ATC conversions having issues We really want a suburban because we don t have room for two car seats and extra space for family when they come to visit but don t want to send a ton of money into something that isn t going to hold up Yeah those are nice but not going to be big enough for me in my power chairI hate being in a wheelchairI m not sure if I should make a big deal ot of this sounds like you should see a doc   neurologist I have not had anything similar but then again everyone s injury and recovery is very individualized Honestly I d talk to your doc I had something like this I ignored for while this is purely anecdotal so don t take it as gospel Basically my left arm would go numb from time to time but I ignored it because I figured I was just leaning on my armrests weirdly Turns out I had an aneurysm in my head that was pushing on a nerve The only reason I talked to a doc s because part of my face went numb one time and that kind of freaked me out I literally would have died if I waited much longer or they took awhile to find out what was going on Get yourself checked Better to know for sure than just guess  Get yourself checked for a syrinx It s a collection of spinal fluid that can compress your spinal cord Since your spinal cord is already damaged it might be at the level of your injury pressing upwards  sounds like towards T1 or even C8 nerve  The treatment is a shunt and a few days flat on your back Unknown if sensation issue from now will normalize but certainly don t want it to get worse or make your SCI jump up a level   Edit  Not a doctor but am a nurse Please see a doctor and get yourself checked out I hope it s nothing   Edit  don t know if you ll see this but was wondering if your arm stuff had gotten better since this I hope so  How are you OP Did you get your arm checked out  Yeah I have to go do a nerve conductivity test to see what the problem isA close family member and book worm recently had a SCI Trying to find a book to help her through this difficult time It would help to know a little about her interests as they pertain to books her age and her mental temperament Is she 18 and reads popular teen romance Would a philosophical book appeal more to her     First off I would advise strongly against gifting her a book for the purpose of helping her through this difficult time Or at least don t tell her that Giving the pope the bible  or even a choir boy  wouldn t help much with post SCI depression     For me reading my favorite type of fiction helped enormously via distraction escape and the embedded wisdom about the human condition in a lot of good fiction I also enjoyed reading about astronomy physics and the philosophy of science In the purely cerebral domains my paralysis is not disabling Finally philosophical texts also helped a lot The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus helped me reason through why suicide isn t my best option It is a sense read but it contains truly beautiful ideas     I hope her recovery is fruitful and swift She will surely appreciate your support even if she struggles to show it  If their spinal cord injury affects their hands I would recommend getting a e book on a tablet I hate flipping pages If you want a good book related to SCI I highly recommend Don t Call It a Miracle It s 100  information about what exactly a spinal cord injury is what research is being done and how that research gets funded   I also recommend that as her friend you read it Arm yourself with an understanding of the many therapies that are coming down the pipeline and be aware of some of the more snake oil options that are being peddled too   Also the book is free on Kindle  If she s an engineer she might enjoy The Martian I read that right after I got injured and the optimistic pragmatism of the book really helped me I m a scientist It reminded me how humans can adapt and overcome  I d recommend Cities in Flight by James Blish  Not SCI related but a very engrossing and distracting read  Sometimes what you need most is escape  Man s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl I ve read it 4 or 5 times now Everyone should read it lol It s super short and keeps me going when things get tough  She s in her eary thirties She just had a baby less than 3 months ago I would describe her as being rather stoic and quite practical and masculine in her interests  she is or was an engineer Im not sure what s happening there now  The myth of Sisyphys sounds fascinating after a quick google I might consider it Thank you for your well wishes I second this  Reading real books for me has been greatly effected and it might be for them  Plus getting something to hold it up I use a big fluffy pillow in my lap  looking down at a book can be really painful   Edit to add arm weakness is another concern  and pain  I also have both  I m not sure if they have those issues  but it s something to consider with SCI DO YOU WANT A WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VAN CHECK THIS OUT In my desperate search for a new wheelchair accessible van I accepted an invitation to test ride the new 2019 Honda Odyssey LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE This would be so convenient How many people were given plastic AFOs  ankle foot orthotics  plastic braces after their injuries Not AFOs but I was made custom KAFOs that really were pointless They did give me skin problems  and I was told they just need to be recast but I didn t find them at all worth the trouble  It is extremely unlikely that these orthotics caused your neurogenic pain As you probably know the whole difference between neurogenic pain and regular pain is that is it caused by the injury to your nerves  with you at L1  and not caused by anything at the point where you feel the pain It is possible in incomplete injuries that sensations get translated into different sensory feelings of pain but that wouldn t cause permanent pain It should go away when you take off the orthotics     I m not a doctor and not your doctor so of course I can be wrong Why do you think the orthotics caused your pain or contributed to it Why do you think the atrophy of your calf muscles is caused by it You mention you ve got an incomplete SCI so can the atrophy not just be associated with your nerve damage  I had a traditional AFO and then I got a  turbomed fs3000  https   turbomedorthotics com  It allows some ankle movement so won t lose muscle but it still helps you avoid foot drop Highly highly recommended  I have friends who have the same problems with AFOs Even with only covering half of the leg they are heavy and uncomfortable to use They also cause skin problems One of my friends who would rather walk and drag her feet on the ground than wear plastic AFOs     x200B   I think some specialists forget about comfort when we have to wear braces These  KAFOs  https   www thuasneusa com products custom fabricated specialty bracing custom kaf orthoses product_premier kafo   appear to have padding everywhere except the feet Not saying they would work for you just saying some specialists don t take into account how miserable it is feeling hard materials against your body with every step And that the hard materials do cause skin irritations that we constantly have to deal with The plastic AFOs completely covered my calf muscles causing them to completely shrink and atrophy They went all the way up my calves to just under my knees     x200B   The incomplete spinal cord injury caused me to lose the ability to use my ankles feet and toes In the hospital I was fitted with plastic AFOs Plastic AFOs are hard material that do not offer muscle feedback Basically you re not able to use the muscles they cover Instead of being able to use calf muscles to help me walk the plastic AFOs were hindering that Due to not being used this caused my calf muscles to completely shrink and atrophy My injury did not cause that Having to wear plastic AFOs did My neurogenic pain is only in my calf muscles where my muscles have atrophied     x200B   Basically imagine if you broke a bone You have to wear a cast that immobilizes your muscles so the bone can set and heal That weakens the muscle and you have to do exercises to restrengthen it It s basically the same concept with plastic AFOs You can t use the muscles they cover So I couldn t use my calf muscles when I walked This caused them to completely shrink to the bone and atrophy And that s where the neurogenic pain comes from I actually did switch to  toe off AFOs  https   www allardusa com foot drop afos foot drop moderate stability toeoff r 2 0 2 html  3 1 2 years after my injury It pisses me off though because it took me 2 1 2 years to get the orthotics specialist to let me try alternatives for the plastic AFOs All they did was tell me nothing would work better without exactly letting me know why It shouldn t have taken me 2 1 2 years     x200B   And recently I found out a couple months ago that I can wear these   https   www mcdavidusa com the 195tm ankle brace w straps 195tm  https   www mcdavidusa com the 195tm ankle brace w straps 195tm   All they do is immobilize my ankles so I can walk They are so comfortable because there is no hard material rubbing against my feet when walking It feels like I m just wearing shoes The kicker is I could ve used this since Day 1 after my injury All I needed were my ankles to be immobilized I didn t progress into being able to use these ankle braces could ve always been able to use them     x200B   At least now I feel like I might be able to progress to walking without needing any adaptive equipment I started in a power wheelchair Then progressed to manual wheelchair walker to just using walker to forearm crutches and now using canes So hopefully these ankle braces will help me ditch the canes Just have to keep doing the exercises I just wish I had the ankle braces since the beginning Probably would ve taken years off my recovery and wouldn t have lost my calf muscles Those braces look awesome though I really like how the braces don t actually rub against your skin  deleted My husbands x rayCan a radiologist  armchair or otherwise  tell me what the loopy bumpy line is Is it where the shrapnel bullet took its route  Bullet wound  Looks to me like that s his colon It s apparently filled with air and since it s pulled up and to the left I m thinking this X ray was taken in the operating room when they had his abdomen opened up and his  innards  pulled out and slung to the side in order to get to his vertebrae   But I m just a nurse so take this with a grain of salt  Edit  a wordIf you re asking about the parts that look like a snake for lack of a better term I believe are the colon intestines Yup Attempted robbery Dr Drew Podcast deleted  I don t at the moment I just saw a  Call in now  thing on his twitter and knew it was about suicide I didn t know what to say really because i was calling to basically say  Just keep living  and next thing I knew I was on the phone with the big guy and some lady I imagine it will upload at some point It was a suicide awareness prevention episode I am  Daniel from Alabama  so maybe it will turn up and I ll find itLeaking after a UTIIf you think it is all cleared up  odor and color are back to normal   just wait it out It usually didnt take too long for the leak to stop Better days ahead SCI Dec 2009 and had UTI on and off for a few years no UTI for about 5 years now  Double triple check to make sure you re clear Antibiotic resistance is a huge problem It can take me trying multiple different drugs Get all the culture results  You may not be 100  out of the woods  Recovery time is longer because of the SCI I d probably give it another week before I started to get concerned If still persists I would head back to the doctor for a urine test and culture  Thanks for the advice I will wait it out for a while I run out of suicide excuses this month  I tell that but my deadline is my 40th bday I have 6 years left Now I don t see this as an actual deadline but I know at that point I will seek help   My advise seek help if you need to Don t give up on this life As a quad I can tell 90  of the things you have gone through I know it sucks  yet there are still things to experience I used to feel like shat 2 years ago I felt all around unworthy I needed to prove myself I wasn t only this I got a job I exceed what I expected from me I fell in love it wasn t possible  I fell into the demon s cage again but I kept going Then I got a job and making 4 times my old salary Now I can plan for stuff Life is good It is still not the life I wanted by far and my love life is absolutely a mess Yet I can t wait for what s to come My life changed because life God let me met myself other people and because I decided to see if life becomes different if I worked on changing my approach to life It totally did and only within 2 years   All this after 17  years post injury   Keep going find a reason try to live and not just survive and if you can add God to the mix  I kind of want to live forever  I mean not really but I m so excited about the possibility of space travel  I hope I live long enough to see that come to fruition   Then there is watching my nephews  4 yrs and almost 2 yrs  grow up  I m greatly looking forward to that        and video games  Can t wait to play the shit out of like Diablo 9 whenever that happens lol   Not to mention that I still need to finish writing my first musical   and after that there are the others that I need to finish as well   Totally need to have sex at least a few hundred  or thousand  more times too     and I need to watch at least the next 40 or so NBA Finals   Ugh there is so much I have to do still  Death will just have to wait  Ha about 10 years into my injury I experienced a shit storm which landed me in hospital for 16 months And do you know what one of my thoughts was  I must keep on keeping on as I need to know how Lost ends  nobody ever believes me when I tell them this Fortunately I found better reasons to live as the end of Lost was bloody awful   Keep hanging on to whatever life rafts keep you afloat  You assume the afterlife is better than the next phase of marvel movies What if its just like the DC universe Or just you and zack snyder in a room doscussing batman vs superman fotever   Isn t there going to be a spin off Maybe you could change it to  until they stop flogging the dead horse that is star wars sequels prequels  you might just live forever  do u like videogames mass effect 3 kept me going for a long time Switch to the Game of Thrones books and it will add years to your timeline  can t believe it s been 20 years since those were first recommended to me  How long until the black widow movie     Good to know i wasn t the only one making excuses My original deadline was when I was 25 Been in the chair for 10 years now and Im 30 It never gets better I just drink some water shrug it off and try to stay occupied with work or family Stay strong you never know whats around the corner  Same here Ever since my injury finishing Thrones has been the only thing on my bucket list I don t really want another excuse though tolerating decades of this is not something I want to do  Watch the movie  Me Before You  Get out of this way of thinking its weak And there isnt any way you are a weak person Look at how much you have already overcome Life is beautiful my friend Once you find true love you will regret ever considering taking your life    and if you can add God to the mix   I feel like he has a large enough role in the situation already I m not here to argue anyone s beliefs but I often say  If there is a God they put me in a serious time out   I ve gone on to do good things in the 10 years since I came up with that Don t believe in an afterlife so No I read them before the show aired or a tleast started themWhere you said  I just need to drink some water  made me bust out laughingI loved that movie I understand his mindset I m not suicidal I just found it funny that now I m out of reasons lol Endgame was amazingIncontinence during utiYeah Usually subsides after a couple of days on antibiotics You might have a bug that you haven t had before that s causing more inflammation and more leakage Ask your doctor about oxybutinin which helps with bladder spasms  Yeah I ve struggled with reoccurring UTIs the past year or so Some antibiotics clear up my symptoms within a day or two and some take a little bit longer It also depends on the bacteria Incontinence is my first sign that I m contracting a UTI so I try to get a culture done ASAP and start taking antibiotics before the other symptoms kick in  fever chills etc    Same here It s how I usually know I have a UTI  Trospium is stronger than oxybutin   stops the bladder spasms even with infection present after a few doses I might have been discriminated against and I m pissedYes you should report it How do I know Because making you feel like shit because of your obvious disability is not part of his effing job Sorry but I ve dealt with jerks like this before and whether or not they learn from it  they won t  they should be punished for causing you distress   Please dont wait and don t feel bad or weird They re the jerk not you   Imagine how much better the whole night would have been if he was super nice and as accommodating as he knew to be Maybe it still would ve been less convenient for him but if he just took the high road things could have been better all around  I wouldn t let a bad driver stop you from riding the bus with your friends That can cause all kinds of impediments in social interaction and cost you fun times in college When I was in the Navy the train was the funnest part of Chicago   A lot of people just don t know how to handle people in wheelchairs The amount of people that think I m mentally impaired just because I sit in a chair is astounding I m normal looking as they come too   Report it but don t let it stop you from hanging out with friends The whole hanging out Not I ll catch you people at the  insert gig here  Do it together  This is discrimination Report it I hope that you obtain her name as well I couldn t even read the whole thing because after  you guys  my blood started to boil You definitely didnt do anything wrong The ADA bus is an accomodation it does not mean that you have to utilize that accomodation if you don t want to  This makes my blood boil I would have tried to run their asses over with my chair lol I hope everything gets worked out Wow that sucks that you were so turned off by the experience that you don t want to ride that bus again   As you said in your last paragraph this is absolutely a problem with driver training They should be happy to have you on the bus and and happy to help tie down your chair Please do report it They have an opportunity to fix a systemic problem  Occupational Therapist here Yes You should take this exact posting s text and send it via email to your school s disability services director or other administrative personnel Note the time and location so they can pin point the driver who was involved I advocate for people who live with disabilities daily as a part of my job But it s even more effective when  if they can  my patients advocate for themselves You rock keep it up  You should say something   at best it is poor training  at worst it is someone harassing you because of your ability Wow if you don t report this it will continue to be done to others in hope you stop Riding the bus   We had that here in Los Angeles after the last bus driver strike  Driver info wheelchirlair that we should use Access service and not the but A lot did not it is hard to get a Access pickup due to some Manny on it now   It went for same orders and pickup 45min wait time   To 24hour req That you don t get the time you need      Report the driver and sup   I d be fucking fuming Think about it this way if you saw another person in a similar situation and the drivers treated them like that and you were an onlooker you d be reporting correct Don t let them think that s the correct manner to deal with a situation like this I m not letting them off the hook because they are damn ignorant   You re pissed about it the next person on the end of something similar might not take it as well as you  Definitely get driver name bus number and times when this happens and report it My wife is in a chair and we almost always get this kind of discrimination when traveling to new places and using public transport There s always  that one driver  who is a complete jerk  Are you guys seriously this thin skinned  does discrimination exist honest question what does discrimination look like in your eyes does the person have to say the words  I am discriminating against you    this was an attempt by the driver to make the person second guess their decision to use the bus I m sure youre well aware of how the ADA is written I dont need to recite it here Video about how handicap people are  normal  Very nice video Good sense of humor   I did notice some misspelled words however But that is my nature  don t hate me for it     In our house  and around close friends  we use terms like  gimp    lame ass motherfucker   and  broke ass   I ll often laugh at my predicament and self label Then I just roll on   So which one are you Political correct virtue signaling or being humorous when you say  the R word    You look young  at least clean shaven  probably diminutive in stature and you re wearing  a Nickelodeon shirt   I have an able bodied doctor who told me she got carded for a rated R movie She looks like a giant 4 year old It happens   Far too many spelling errors for a video titled  Just Words    Green font is a little too small    Just the right amount of humor for me    One time my cousin came over and asked if he could use my computer I said  of course you can   He asked me if I had a gimp I said  you re looking at me what do you think      What he was talking about was a  GNU Image Manipulation Program  We both started laughing so hard LOLThank you for your feedback I understand there s misspelt words that I missed during editing I ll be more diligent next time Spinal Cord Injury and ErectionsAny recent changes in medications Any issues with UTI s  You are still pretty new your body is changing a bunch still but keep on trying focus on the mental component and try not to get discouraged You can also talk to your doc about ED medication it ll likely work well since you have already had success without  T 12 L 1 para  I don t   I typically achieve decent erections and ejaculate with a woman  solo masturbation is mediocre and unfulfilling for me If I stop getting erections it s a sure sign that my body isn t happy about something UTI usually or unexplained A D  This is the best answer imo I had a lot of trouble for a looong time Took 2 years until I was able to actually do it My meds were changed around the time from being opioid centric to not being  btw I m not at all anti opiate They def have a need for chronic pain and breakthrough pain but they do definitely make it more difficult sexually  If you can t get an erection 1st thing in the morning then you should Have your testosterone level checked it runs low in SCI people Once I was put on testosterone therapy I never had a problem with erections People with spasms that keep you awakeI d also endorse the usage of THC and CBD in whatever form you tolerate best   It helps to reduce inflammation which in turn decreases pain It also distracts you a bit from the pain which can also help  Wish I could  Unfortunately I get drug tested to continue getting my opiate meds and pot is illegal in my state so I can t risk it     I ve also found it amazing how well it works to kill spasms I d really like a side effect free alternative to baclofen so would prefer not to have the spaced out feeling does anyone know if CBD oil by itself works or does it need to have the THC  Interesting I came off Pregabalin a while back   that stuff is horrible  I regularly have broken sleep from twitches spazams Needing the loo seems to be a major source  Do you not get high af from the edibles  Also on a side note  watched a doc on the opioid crisis in America  47 000 ppl died in 2017   how in the name of blue fuck did Oxys etc get FDA approval Makes me soo suspicious of pain meds prescribed like Pregabalin Pretty big BUT Do SCI patients in the states get prescribed Oxys for pain  I would get shot and killed if I tried that in my country  Okay I should say that at first the drugs are alsomost always nessarry I m not anti science or any of that nonsense When I first got the nerve pain it was terrifying mentally and physically  the idea that you can be in permanent pain is horrible However I came to terms with the sensation over time to the point I just deal with it Kind like a bad knee or bad back   it just always there  When I was fragile at the start Pregabalin took the edge off the pain and also mentally it definitely calms the overall senses but not really in a drowsy way like say diazipan   Fast forward 2 years  The Pregabalin had really stopped having any noticeable effect on the pain It s hard to even day for sure that it did it 100  it never took it away completely  At this point I d describe the sensation of Pregabalin similar to  having 2 4 light beers or a glass or two of wine   Your not drunk but you know there s a difference on or off them You could read a book but doing something like maths or something mentally taxing is difficult My brother used to joke and call them my  chatty  pills as I would garble on more than usual especially if you have beer whilst on them  Eventually I returned to work an I found I was perfectly comfortable but comfortablely numb when on them  that s the biggest danger long term   I stopped taking them in the morning so if feel more alert a work then I began to notice more the peeks and troughs Get home from work pop in one and twenty minutes later it s like you ve had a few beers after work slumped gormless at the TV  Also they can keep you up at night for sure I changed my routine to try and account for this  After 2 more years I d had enough  I got off them it was quite had although not horrendous but I ve never had issues with substances or smoking  When I stopped taking them I was shocked It was like the me inside my head had been asleep and woke up all of a sudden I could think straight The only way I can describe is  the voice inside your head  your internal monologue is subdued on Pregabalin Sure I could worry again but that s totally normal  I m not saying don t take the drugs I definitely needed them initially  The danger is post hospital 4 years later with little to no medical oversight you can keep going back to the chemist to get your  chatty   pills for life  I d rather have burning feet and my own thoughts     There is CBD oil that doesn t contain THC   it s derived from hemp rather than marijuana This type of CBD oil is available legally nationwide  below 0 3  THC is federally legal  Marijuana is illegal in my state but there are CBD shops popping up all over the place and most smoke shops around here sell at least CBD oil if not edibles as well You ll need to do some research to make sure whatever you re buying won t cause any trace amount of THC to pop your drug test but there s very likely a CBD option for you Look for  CBD isolate     this has a good breakdown of the different types  https   medium com cbd origin full spectrum vs broad spectrum vs cbd isolate the difference explained a09e415bf235    My husband uses CBD oil for spasms and his results have been pretty incredible One time he was having a particularly bad episode and just could not get his legs to calm down I put a drop of CBD oil under his tongue and about 30 seconds later the spasms began to subside After about 10 minutes they were gone completely and the effects lasted several hours He uses 1000mg   full spectrum but he doesn t have to deal with drug tests I believe CBD is legal as long as it s under 3  thc in it than it s ok in illegal states I m not 100  sure so please check your own localities If I were you I would take the risk of getting a ticket  Opiates are no joke and I hear CBD can help you get off of it Good luck buddy I tried CBD only oil and it didn t help much  I grew my own and made it into edibles which has helped alot I think it has some thc but not much Online sources say the strain I grew has anywhere from a 1 15 to 1 24 ratio of THC CBD But when I medicate I would say it s more like 1 5 I think it s best for you to try different ratios and brands for yourself because everyone reacts differently I posted my husband s experience on another comment but basically he uses full spectrum CBD oil which does have  some  THC but below the federally allowed maximum  0 3   He uses 1000mg and it works well for him a hell of a lot better than baclofen flexoril or robaxin have done  he s about to try tizanidine but isn t holding his breath for that one working better than the others  From what I understand THC typically boosts the effects of CBD but you may find you don t need it It s definitely worth a shot They got fda approval because there are legitimate uses of it but it s insanely addictive How weed isn t legal I have no clue insanity My partner is still in the hospital from a recent spine injury and they started giving him pregabalin the other day We don t actually know anything about it really What are some of the negative side effects you ve experienced with it I do get pretty high but it s a low thc strain so I m able to contain myself and not feel sick  Yeah big pharma definitely as a strong grip on the nation unfortunately  Don t want to be those annoying CBD is a miracle Evangelist but it seriously helped me so much and just want others to get some relief too Is this of use to us No If the strings are cut training the puppeteer better is of no use  I still have a thread or two  I like to think of mine as the tracks are still there but the line is damaged in a certain spot Fixing the damage is the question and the body already had its chanceAnyone else had an multi level ACDF I m 2years post op and can t find answers anywhere I created my first short film for a film festival involving film makers with disabilities I thought you guys might want to check it out good on you   film making is indeed tough Tips for independent living I don t have any personal experience but as a quad currently living with my parents with hopes to be independent next year this post makes me happy Good luck  Do you have a resource centre near you that would have an occupational therapist who can do a home visit and give suggestions   When I was being discharged from rehab an ot did a few home visits and gave some really great suggestions as to railings  I m ambulatory  and washroom railings to ensure I was safe on the washroom  My advice would be to keep it as normal house as it can be and to make a list of all nearby resources medical and otherwise     It sounds like great progress good luck with it  With the blanket that gets thrown over disabilities and accessibility if there is something being suggested to make it  accessible  but it doesn t apply to you don t waste your money  Even if it is something that an OT suggests but you feel is irrelevant to your particular needs  with obvious thought down the road etc  don t feel like you have to and don t let anyone push you into it It is your home and your choice  Thanks Good luck to you tooYeah i think you can get an OT to do assessment without too much bother on the UK question is whether to hire one or use the NHS But yeah ill start investigating this on Monday Very true One of the big decisions i have to make concerns a lift The house has a upstairs bedroom and bathroom i intend to use as a guest carer room so the time id need to spend up there would be limited But i want to be able to access all areas of my home   Decisions decisionsDrones for quads  I fly RC aircraft and occasionally drones using my mouth with the controls mounted up near my face so definitely possible     I m a c5 6 n have got a DJI phantom 4 pro and can fly it no probs the best thing with them is when u take ur hands off the controls it stops where it is I put a stable table on my lap for the controller n pick the drone up with a bit of rope with loops on each end They re pretty hard to crash really I have a DJI mavic Pro my dad stuck some PVC over the controls to make them stick out like joysticks so I have better control Like danzstenz75 said a decent drone like DJI drones hover by themselves in the air and are easy to control if you get your controller set up right I have a few videos I made with my drone on my Instagram if you want to check them out My Instagram username is the same as mine here  I currently own a mavic Pro and the last one I owned was DJI spark They both work fine for me and I am a C8 T1  Spinal fusion surgery comin  up fastGood luck man  Had mine done in 06 l3 l5  It s been a ride  I hope yours is more successful  That s grim mate  Those IVs can fuck off  I wish you well    I could look it up on google i know but i really like your sour bitter style of story telling  so could you tell me in as lengthy way as you wish what this operation is about and how you came to do it  Good luck  To be completely honest I m 8 years into being a c6 7 quad and I have been getting a ton of clicking and crunching in my neck I have a c3 t1 fusion and I know I need to get it checked out but I want to stay oblivious to the idea of getting my fusion re done I deal with the pain and as long as I m not in pure agony or my head is not detached I m determined to go as long as I can  You asked for it   So about 10 years ago I started noticing this crunching and grinding coming from my spine  I asked at least 2 PTs and 3 doctors what the fuck  is  that  The answer was either I don t know or Arthritis  So I shrugged my shoulders and went on with my life   Well as the years went by this crunching kept getting worse and worse  It wasn t causing me pain at least not at first but the sensation of what seemed like marbles grinding against each other was hair raising  Eventually my back pain worsened but I never really connected the two    One day I noticed something strange  at the left side of my torso I had space between it and my arm rest but the right side of my torso   no space  I was crooked  I kept trying to push myself back over to the left but my body kept falling to the right  It got so bad that I started putting a washcloth between my right side and my arm rest because it was cutting into my side  I also noticed that I could do this thing where I could kind of push my torso back upright like re stacking a jenga tower and when I did this I could suddenly breathe more deeply    along with becoming crooked I was losing lung capacity   I went to a local back doctor and demanded an x ray saying Something is wrong this is not just arthritis  X ray came back and he says Wow  Who wants to hear their doctor say Wow  The bottom of my spinal fusion done when I got into a car accident that caused my SCI back in 2000 has radically shifted off kilter from the vertebrae below it and the two have been grinding each other down to nubs  Then he says we could do a fusion but then the same thing would happen below  that  fusion sooooo   here s a back brace byeee   And I m like FUCK  So I m thinking this guy he s not and SCI specialist I need to get to San Jose  So began the journey from Marina to Monterey to San Jose to San Francisco  Official diagnosis    Charcot spine    Charcot  some French guy  means basically that a joint gets all out of whack because it has no sensation and your body can t say Hey Stop moving like that so it gets all fucked up  I have pieces of vertebrae missing because they ve just been ground away and absorbed by my body  I had an area of fluid around my spine that had collected from all this inflammation   So the only way to avoid this happening again in the future lower down is to fuse all of my spine below this Charcot area all the way down to the pelvis  I now have not only rods down to my sacrum but also gigantic screws going from the rods into my pelvis  I now have what is basically a permanent internal back brace down to my hips  I can no longer bend at the waist  I can no longer pick things up off the floor    I can reach about 4 5 inches above the floor but that s as low as I go  I depend on reachers and grabbers now and will be getting a service dog in the future  I ve lost mobility but I ve also lost pain and gained lung capacity so yay   AAAAHHHHH thank you for letting me get all of that out      EDIT  For those of curious to exactly what s going on with this surgery here s the abstract of a study     Charcot spine as a late complication of traumatic spinal cord injury      Charcot spine also known as neuropathic spinal arthropathy is a late complication of traumatic spinal cord injury that can produce pain and further disability We report five cases of Charcot spine occurring in patients with previous traumatic spinal cord injury that we have identified at our institution from 1985 to 1994 All patients had complete paraplegia with levels of neurologic injury ranging from T7 to T12 Common presenting symptoms included back pain loss of spasticity change in bladder function and audible noises with motion The diagnosis of Charcot spine was made from 6 to 31 years after original spinal cord injury In four cases where a surgical fusion had been performed the Charcot joint developed within two spinal segments below the caudal end of the fusion Radiological studies especially plain films and computed tomography were helpful in making the diagnoses Immobilization of the affected joint is an essential element of treatment Surgical repair and stabilization were performed in four patients and has been recommended to the other patient Early diagnosis and proper treatment is important in preventing the progression of this disorder     https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 9041906If I was able to get in earlier I might have had less invasive options  Just sayin  Quads that have a Nintendo switch how do you use it My dad is quad and although he doesn t play the Switch he plays PC games using a Quadstick It s a specialized sip and puff with multiple input tubes and a stiffer joystick It is compatible with many consoles and PC It s expensive but that would be your best bet There s a way to use the Xbox adaptive controller on the Nintendo switch  You said you use a regular PS4 controller I am a similar injury and do the same mainly playing sports games or single player When I play the switch I use their pro controller I can use it the same way I use a regular PS4 controller Maybe it ll work for you too  I think I m like you I have looked and even bought an adapted controller but ended up using the normal controller I m pretty much limited to just playing Madden which isn t the same game as 10 years ago I want to try the new Xbox adapted controller but all of the add ons make it get up to  400  really quick  Thx for the infoThx I d prefer to look that upThere are a variety of third party devices that make controllers work with different systems  XAC with Switch  one of them is called a Titan Two Didn t know they had a pro controller Would be amazing then ThxBlood pressureHey mate mine runs at about 95 65 stable at that for last 20 years or so I do remember in earlier years it dropping when first getting out of bed for the day n sometimes getting light headed but that goes away as ur body gets used to bein a quad  100 60 base but will be lower in the morning cus I ve been lying all night   Will be higher if I m up and about   There is midodrine which will help elevate bp Talk to your doctor about that Andy know the risks of the drug   When I first got injured I would pass out just sitting up in bed Your body will adjust and if not then there are things to help such as drugs or compression socks and belts Mine drops when I put me on the standing frame Im a paraplegic and my blood pressure is always low especially after meals I get really tired when my bp gets too low so after i eat i prefer to just lie down for a while and do some breathing exercises  ie meditation and wim Hof method  to stabilize my bp I dont take meds for it I also go to the gym and that also helps with the bp as well Having low bp is not fun but its just part of life as a paraplegic  Im a pharmacist so I can tell you that ED meds like Viagra can definitely lower your bp to dangerously low levels so be careful If youre going to use it start low dose and go up slowly   Hope that helps I m para and my BP is usually around 85 48 Ten years ago I started taking clonidine which comes with a risk of lowering BP but I started it regardless Fortunately it hasn t caused it to lower any further   I have found that having my first meal prior to sitting up helps to not experience any dizzy spells so I keep a protein bar by my bed  Same here but a little higher so nearer 115 I wear an abdominal binder for support and it helps How do you cope I agree with a lot of what has been said already  There is plenty of great advice which I won t bother repeating   I do have a suggestion though   Don t say things like  probably for the rest of my life I will be in a wheelchair    Instead say  probably for the rest of my life I will use a wheelchair    Don t think of the wheelchair as something that limits you  Think of it as something that gives you freedom and helps you be independent   A big part of this is going to be changing your mindset   Anyway there are plenty of us here to help you if you need to talk or have any other questions  It took me almost a year to come to terms with my disability I went from a national level athlete swimming triathlons etc who committed to a D1 college to not even being able to get through a school pay due to pain   After my injury I focused a lot on what I can t do and shifted my focus on what I can do I can still study to be a doctor I can still swim I can still be athletic I just have to do things differently now and I m grateful to learn how to be ok with asking others for help  My husband Jeff is a quad since 1991 He says  exercise somehow Start driving ASAP it ll help you with all of your independence  He said at 3 weeks he was still crying to his mom You re not alone Gratitude  Hi Ananbelle C4 5 quad 5 yrs incomplete here   What I would say is that our perspectives are very different your yours right now  When I was first injured I couldn t hear or pocess practical advice   It s a bit like when you loose someone close to you There is a real grieving process to go through  When my dad passed away quite young I almost resented the  well wishers  the  be positive   I mean  what good does it doo   doesn t change a thing  etc A friend of mine also lost their dad a few years before She looked at me and said     Nothing I can do or say can change a thing or take the pain away However I can tell you that you won t always feel this way in time it gets better   This moved my mindset in a profound way   Letting go of the old you and embracing the new   So for now I can tell you with absolute certainty that there will be a day or a moment in the near future when you will feel normal again When it happens bank it build from it  Some practical points now some for the future   Avoid indulging the temptation of the  I will never list   Make a new bucket list  Change your self talk

a lot to come his way   Just remember Life might be different now but it s not over We spoke to a great guy with a SCI who had taken years to come to terms with his injury but now has a much more positive outlook He assured my partner he can still do everything in life it s just different and different doesn t mean bad Life really is what you make of it  I m a c6 7 quad and I ve been for about 8 years now I don t even remember my first month really due to being stuck in the ICU   I know in the beginning I pushed everyone who wasn t my mom away including my fiance Don t do that That was my way of protecting everyone People still want to be apart of your life probably moreso than before That is probably my greatest advice Keep pushing and do your rehab It will distract you for a few hours and make you get some good sleep Also avoid painkillers and sleeping pills as much as possible I have spent the last 2 3 years weaning off of them It s way too easy to get addicted and nobody will tell you a thing because they just assume you REALLY need it To be honest I m in the same amount of pain as before except I now just take Aleve or Tylenol  10 years in    The real rehabilitation

important as the physical rehab Learning to reframe situations really helped me personally Also you re so recently injured a period of adjustment is expected This is different for everyone I really struggled for about three years but I was injured during puberty so I expect hormones flying around didn t help   It s quite a weird experience when you also have a chronic illness Things happened the other way around to you  my injury was at 11 then a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease at 27 I kind of can t relate to either camp But there must be some of us with both an illness and sci Maybe we need to start our own group     All the sickening clich s about time and patience and taking each day as it comes are sadly true  I just got done doing a research study that basically teaches you how to flip this  like you did  and how your emotions drive this thought process 10 years down the road and I m still trying to figure myself out   I also suggest OP to learn educate and meditate Close your eyes breath and  listen  to your body As hippie as that shit sounds I ve found it to help in tough times This helped me so much in the beginning I looked at it from a semantic view  I m not  in  a chair I ride  on  a chair As many times as I used to find it a hindrance I quickly realized that without my chair I d be in bed instead of trying to maneuver through a park or getting on the elevator It helps me to do normal things with people really great loving advice from PissStick I love reddit Just about ten years as well There s still periods of down but overall it s the relearning

reports  No worries Send me a copy of your latest mri reports Are you disabled  Yes I m disabled   but not according to the government My pain is a where from 3 9 consistently I can t drive I can t sit in regular chairs I can t stand for more than 5 mins I can t have sex can t do any physical activity   any of these things  even if I do them very carefully  will put me in bed for weeks but it usually causes a permanent increase in pain   making me thing that it s doing damage to my cord   I do however work from home as a programmer in a gravity chair I have to work 12 hrs for every 3 hrs

have spontaneous resolution of disc protrusion  What levels are the herniated discs  Are your symptoms more one sided or both   Have you tried physical therapy If so what was your experience like   Disc herniation is in large resolved through movement  I suspect your high levels have pain have kept you largely sedentary which has only contributed to your current situation  Has there ever been a time where your pain as been under control Has it gotten worst ver time    I have parasthesias from head to toe  Head would mean that the spinal cord at C2 is involved   The whole body being involved sounds more like something neurodegenerative Spinal cord injuries usually produce fairly circumscribed neurological deficiencies   u badcat_kazoo    u assemblerguy  I ve seen over 40 doctors  including 4 Pain Medicine docs 3 neurologists 5 neurosurgeons and every other specialist you can think of  I ve been to the best hospitals in the world  Cleveland Clinic  in Cleveland  Mayo Clinic University of Florida Shands Orlando Hospital and many more  I m not sure this is a neurodegenerative issue I ve had EVERY test you can think of and have been diagnosed with a shit ton of disorders but nothing neurodegenerative My CK levels were fine HOWEVER on my first MRI the Radiologist had this to say  Multilevel degenerative disease of the thoracic spine with disc protrusions extrusion at T5 T6 T6 T7 T8 T9 and T10 T11 causing mass effect on the cord with a punctate focus if increased T2 signal in the cord at T5 suggesting myelomalacia   MYELOMELACIA That is a scary disorder Basically a death sentence However on my next MRI it had this to say  At T5 6 there is a central disc protrusion with effacement of anterior thecal space and deformity of the cord There is no abnormal cord signal The previously described altered signal is not seen to advantage   The abnormal cord signal  suggesting myelomelacia  has not been seen on any one of my subsequent MRIs after the first  there have been 4      x200B   However since Myelomelacia is incurable is it possible that it just disappeared What do you think BTW since that first MRI I was in a rollover car accident and was also rear ended I would really appreciate if you could read my other  pretty long  comment which goes much more in depth as to my multiple diagnoses     x200B   I ve tried every therapy you can think of For the pain I ve tried myriads of pain nerve medications steroid injections Botox injections nerve ablations physical and water therapy chiropractors  made it worse  massages acupuncture psychological therapy to help reduce the pain TENS units  they help a bit  a pain pump  helps more than oral meds  and more Before the nerve ablation only my entire back right arm and right leg were in pain The morning after my nerve ablation my face left arm left leg ribs and groin burned like holy hell I remember just screaming in my bed I could not move Time did not lessen the pain My doctors had to increase my Gabapentin to 3600 mg add Lyrica 600 mg and Oxycodone 30 mg 4 times per day It kept the pain under control for the time being     x200B   I have 8 herniated bulged discs all throughout my spine 2 in lumbar 4 in thoracic and suspected 2 in cervical I haven t been able to do physical therapy for 4 years At first physical therapy was working Then one day while sitting in an airplane for 10 hours on my way back from California my entire right arm shoulder started burning so badly that I was in bed for 2 weeks It eventually got a bit better Then one day while sitting in class I started having intense pressure build at the base of the back of my skull The pressure spread into my arms and legs and I started burning everywhere Since that day I have not been able to sit in any chairs with my back erect I think the positioning causes my disks to compress my spinal cord even more I am currently sitting in a gravity chair It s the only position I can be in that doesn t increase my pain Lying on my back increases my pain Standing increases my pain I am 100 percent certain I am dealing with spinal cord compression     x200B   Yes it gets worse over time But time is not the factor   activity and accidents are A few years ago before the pain disabled me I had sex The next day my entire body was in so much pain that I couldn t get out of bed Weeks passed and the flare didn t subside So the doctors increased my meds The pain was back under control I tried having sex again Same thing happened The doctors had to increase my meds My pain was back under control This viscous cycle of activity accidents pain from positioning has continued for the past 4 years except that now something as simple as trying too hard to open a bottle of sauce increases my pain permanently I have no idea what s going on and neither do any of my doctors     x200B   My balance is getting worse and worse  which is common in cases of cord compression  and so I fall more often now A month ago I fell through my closet and when I stood up my right hand and arm were numb I could not make a fist I went to the ER but all they could do was refer me to a neurosurgeon I see him in 2 weeks The numbness has gotten a bit better I can now make a fist I could not light a lighter after I fell  my right thumb was too weak  but now I can However my right index finger is still too weak to light a lighter and I still have some numbness For the first 3 weeks after I feel I felt intense pressure in my right hand My fingers went blue every so often but running hot water over it turned it back to flesh color     x200B   What are your thoughts  I just read this in a medical journal        From a 34 year old man with T10 paraplegia          You know you d have to have a complete injury not to feel pain Not all quads and paras have complete injuries  we do have pain The worst pain kind of starts like a pressure like from an overworked muscle Then it progresses into a burning like a heat you can t make stop It gets to the point where honestly doc you don t want to live anymore   This is EXACTLY how my pain started after than 10 hr plane trip Then I felt it again while sitting in class at Univeristy  while I was still well enough to attend class  How significant is this finding to my diagnosis  I just want to thank you for your continued involvement in my case despite me being  difficult  initially I am irritable lately no motivation just wanting to sleep all day   nothing personal   I actually do have a Lyme Disease dr and I got tested by the best Lyme Disease lab in the US Lyme is notorious hard to detect There are a different number of microbes they test for which they call  bands  I had 4 or 5 positive bands including Borrelia  Lyme s real name  specific bands Then my doctor did a Lumbar puncture and had my CSF tested for Lyme as well It tested positive So I ve known for awhile  at least 3 years  that I ve had this However due to the nature of my progression  I get worse when I fall  I figure it HAD to be my back and couldn t be anything else   You re right man I need to start listening to my doctors If I had given up of the cord thing years ago I could have been having treatment this whole time Which brings me to what treatment I ve had   The most effective anti biotic for Lyme  or one of the most  is ceftriaxone I was treated with a high dose of liquid ceftriaxone daily through a semi permanent picc line in my neck which delivered the medication straight to my heart I was on this treatment for 6 months and it didn t do fuck all   Then I was sent to an immunologist and my immunoglobulin levels were tested They were very low  due to Lyme s attack on my body  and I was put on IVIG A nurse came to my house every other week and set me up with an IV and delivered IVIG to me I was on it for 2 years and while it increased my immunoglobulins to normal level again it didn t do anything for my pain   I also tried the Whals Protocol which is basically like a paleo diet except you have to eat 12 cups of fruits and veggies per day I was on it for 6 mo tha with no improvements I did lose all my muscle mass while in the diet though so I m pretty upset about that   We also tried Amoxicillin Tetracycline Minocycline  which crosses the blood brain barrier so it s more effective than other tetracyclines  but none of it worked   I was recently taken off IVIG since my symptoms didn t improve but I m going to fight to get back on it I m going to need everything I can helping my immune system   My next step is to start those peptides I was telling you about They apparently dramatically reduce inflammation so maybe it s what I need to get better I m also going to make a number of lifestyle changes including  more supplements better diet  less carbs   more fruits veggies  and possibly try and see a world famous Lyme Specialist My grandfathers pockets are very deep and he s very generous  along with being one of my best friends  He is willing to pay for any treatment that might work   I need to get my pain more under control  like you said  so I m going to try a ketamine infusion possibly a spinal cord stimulator and maybe Celebrex I do know I need to get the hell off Carbamezapine because it s ruining my liver and decreasing the blood levels of my other meds   I see a neurosurgeon next week so he ll be able to tell me more about my back I see a neurologist the week after that and I m hoping to get a nerve conduction study and an EMG Hopefully they have some answers  T56 is your problem  Why is your cord being pinched there   You need a lami or lami discectomy Do you have med insurance and what kind ahh Ok Well I sorta wish it was a tumor so they could just remove it though I m probably simplifying it  I accept BCBS Send me a copy of your MRIs  Do you want to mail your discs to me or upload the Dropbox  Bspine com Drbigfooter   there is one thing you can do to help Would you mind reading my succinct as possible summary of issues and attempt to help diagnose the issue If I don t support enough information you either  A  can ignore this message or B  ask more questions I would really appreciate it Here it is   Chronic pain    I am a 32 yr old male that has suffered with chronic pain in every inch of my body since 2013 I burn  tingle quiver   all the classic signs of nerve damage pain I feel like I am plugged into a large battery all the time  Before I was put on Gabapentin and other nerve pain meds I screamed in bed until I was so tired from screaming I just shivered in my bed Now with the enormous amount of meds I am on it s a bit better controlled I was diagnosed with Central Sensitization pain disorder at Cleveland Clinic   I have no quality of life I live in my bed rarely leave the house walk with a cane can t have sex can t exercise can t go out to eat can t stand more than 10 minutes can t go to work can t drive myself can t be driven  while lying on a mattress in the back of a van  more than 30 miles because every little bump in the road feels like a knife in the back and most anything else a normal 32 year old does   Herniated Disks Cord Compression   Mechanically I have 8 herniated discs and Degenerative Disk Disease diagnosed by my neurologist  with concurring opinions from at least four other spine nerve specialists  The diagnosis was based upon contrasted MRI s of my entire spine and brain  I ve been in 5 serious and 1 minor car accident  head on collision 2 rollovers hit from behind and hit another car from behind  I also used to power lift with very very heavy weights My MRIs show cord compression in 3 places on my thoracic area and facet joint changes in my cervical area However the neurosurgeons say that it is unlikely the pain is coming from the compression  BULLSHIT  and that surgery wouldn t help  more BULLSHIT    Sitting Intolerance   In 2013 after a 10 hr flight in which I had to sit straight up  as you do on a plane  I felt a horribly painful pressure build up in the lower back of my skull I then felt that pressure spread to my back arms and legs Finally the burning in my joints  it feels like fire ants inside all my joints  got so extreme that I had tears coming from my eyes From that day forward I have not been able to sit upright in a chair without these symptoms reoccurring I can only sit in a gravity chair I m guessing the cord compression makes it so that a gravity chair puts the least amount of pressure on my discs   Exercise Intolerance   Any time I put forth ANY physical exertion my symptoms get horribly worse and I am stuck in bed for days If it is a fall or an accident my pain increases permanently  not just a  flare   and my doctors must increase my meds   Standing Intolerance   I can only stand for 10 minutes at a time without my back becoming so painful and weak that it cannot hold my body up I then have to lay in bed for at least 2 hours before I can try standing again I also use a cane to walk   High Intracranial Pressure   I have high intracranial pressure  25 mmHg  tested when I had my last spinal tap   Ergonomic Accommodations   I can only sleep in MY bed It took me years to find a bed that I can actually fall asleep in It is a firm mattress with a 2 inch memory foam topper I cannot stay with family for the holidays because I can only sleep in my bed This last Christmas I drove down south for Christmas  the car ride was horrible  and we had to travel to 4 different family members houses because I couldn t sleep in any of the beds I ended up having to knock myself out with 3 sleeping pills per night because the beds causes me so much pain I also cannot drive myself My girlfriend drives me around in a mini van equipped with a mattress in the back on which I lie  We can drive for a maximum of 30 miles without me feeling like death afterwards   Falls and Loss of Balance   My balance is so bad that my occurrence of falls is increasing This is a symptom of cord compression On 3 8 19 I fall backwards into my closet and immediately my back  the length of my spine  burned badly and was a bit numb My right thumb middle and ring fingers became numb and I have severe weakness and loss of pain sensation in my right hand I cannot light a lighter write legibly or make a fist without tremendous effort Since this injury my fingers and hands turn blue about once a week When I run hot water over them it seems to go away My right leg now also has severe radiculopathy Every step I take feels like I am dying I feel the pain radiating throughout my body as if I were connected to a large battery with shocks burning pins and needles from head to toe including my arms legs and groin I also shuffle as I walk I shuffle slower than my 80 year old grandpa except he can exercise and I cannot    Neurological Lyme Disease   Bartonella   I ve been diagnosed with Neurological Lyme disease  tested from my spinal fluid  and bartonella by the US s most premier Lyme disease laboratory thanks to my brilliant Lyme disease specialist   Autoimmune Disorder   I ve also been diagnosed with CVID  Common Variable Immune Deficiency  by my Immunologist for which I receive biweekly IVIG infusions   He did a blood work up and several markers in my Immunoglobulin Panel were very low   POTS  Dysautonomia    My heart is constantly pounding which I originally attributed to anxiety until I was diagnosed with POTS  Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome  with a  tilt table test  at the Cleveland Clinic I also have shortness of breath pretty regularly   to the point where I have to stop what I m doing catch my breath for about a minute then proceed to speak It feels like I m having panic attacks 24 7 originating in my chest and pulling on all the muscles around it I find that when I bathe in a hot bath or hot tub my muscles become so relaxed that my pain decreases noticeably I ve had severe severe anxiety my entire life However that still does not explain all my other diagnoses POTS is a type of dysautonomia Dysautonomia May be due to spinal cord injury   High Blood Pressure   I also have high blood pressure for which I take 3 bp medications Even on all these meds my bp is still elevated I was also found to have high intracranial pressure for which I take a deuteric The intracranial pressure causes nerve pain on my face top of head and the deuteric seems to help that pain    Low Vascularity   Before I got sick I was very vascular It was even commented on several times while giving blood on different occasions that my veins were vascular and easy to find a vein to take blood from Since I ve gotten sick my nurses comment how hard it is to find a good vein and in many occasions they collapse my vein and need to try a new one    Blurry Vision   My eyesight is getting worse No one in my family under the age of 45 has ever needed glasses I ve had to get 3 new prescriptions in the last 2 years and my vision is still getting worse I was diagnosed with Map Dot Fingerprint Dystrophy at the Cleveland Clinic    Hearing Loss   My hearing is going in one ear and it  pops  in the other ear I was diagnosed with premature hearing loss at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio   Treatments Tried   For the Lyme disease I ve tried months of intensive antibiotic treatments  through a picc line in my neck  intense diets supplements cleanses and heavy metal chelation For the pain I ve tried myriads of pain nerve medications steroid injections Botox injections nerve ablations physical and water therapy chiropractors  made it worse  massages acupuncture psychological therapy to help reduce the pain TENS units  they help a bit  a pain pump  helps more than oral meds  and more The meds help to a degree but my doctors are constantly having to increase the dose  due to pain increase NOT due to tolerance of the opiates  I know this because I ve had to increase all my meds and not just my opiates Due to my severe sensitivity to activity I can t do physical therapy properly I have seen over 30 doctors in the past 5 years and none have been able to figure out the connection between all these different diagnoses I have zero family history of any of these diagnoses so I know it s not natural I believe the Lyme Bartonella has caused many of these health issues  dysautonomia  aside from the herniations  which make sense due to the car accidents    I Am Desperate   With so many herniations and disks compressing my cord I am very much trying to find a doctor to operate to decompress my spinal cord   Thanks for taking the time to read this   PS The following are my current medications   Oral Meds   30 mg Oxycodone 4 x per day  for pain   2 years   200 mg Lyrica 3 x per day  for pain  4 years   800 mg Gabapentin 2 x per day  for pain  5 years   200 mg

looked at the results yet because I m too scared As of right now I still have hope But if the MRI doesn t show the compression enough I ll be having my pain pump then doing a stand up MRI The stand up MRIs in my area are all 0 6 T but my pump was only tested on a 1 5 T so we have to use 1 5 T machines   I will send you the results as soon as I look at them Thank you SO MUCH for taking time out of your busy schedule to help a stranger I really appreciate it If only there were more doctors in this world like you    u drbigfooter    Here is my most recent MRI I dont know how they have an

04 05 2019 10 13 AMI just read this in a medical journal        From a 34 year old man with T10 paraplegia      You know you d have to have a complete injury not to feel pain Not all quads and paras have complete injuries  we do have pain The worst pain kind of starts like a pressure like from an overworked muscle Then it progresses into a burning like a heat you can t make stop It gets to the point where honestly doc you don t want to live anymore   This is EXACTLY how my pain started after than 10 hr plane trip Then I felt it again while sitting in class at Univeristy  while I was still well enough to attend class  How significant is this finding to my diagnosis Sorry to hear you are in this position  I m a physical therapist so cannot comment on the medical management of your condition  If it has stumped 5 neurosurgeons than I ve got no chance of figuring it out     x200B   There are a few things I can comment on      the surgeons all appear to agree you are not appropriate for surgery therefore conservative management is your only option     prolonged sitting and lack of movement is only contributing to your problem  You said yourself physical therapy was working until you sat for 10 hours on a flight  Sitting is one of the worst things you can do because of increased compression forces on the spine      lack of movement is bad for spinal health    x200B   I suggest you look to get your pain under control to a level where you can revisit the idea of physical therapy  The only way you can manage this is through movement as surgical intervention is not a possibility  On a positive note a good portion of your current pain is likely due to your very sedentary lifestyle and the likely bad postural habits you ve adopted  If you took a healthy adult and gave them your lifestyle habits it is almost guaranteed they would develop back neck pain and some level of radiculopathy     x200B     x200B   is your pain weakness more one sided Same in arms as in legs  your pattern of pain and weakness can help diagnose where the problem is coming from and whether it is a central of nerve root compression Disclaimer  I am just a random guy with internet access who has attended few classes on medical topics while getting an engineering degree and an interest in neurological topics due to my own disease    With that taken care of here are my thoughts     I ve had EVERY test you can think of and have been diagnosed with a shit ton of disorders but nothing neurodegenerative   Hm The description of the symptoms and the progression in flare ups sounded similar to MS at first Or maybe an as of yet unknown genetic disorder that results in demyelination    You wrote that you are diagnosed with Lyme s disease That is a fairly nasty condition all by itself and could alone be the cause of many if not all of the symptoms    Stupid question  Did they do a brain MRI while they were at it    Since you re already on a truckload of anti seizure meds the symptoms being attributable to seizures is probably unlikely      My CK levels were fine    As far as I know CK tests for muscular injury muscular degeneration or various forms of muscular dystrophy The latter results in the direct destruction of muscle cells and is not a disease of the nervous system even though the end result   paralysis   is often associated with neurological disorders      MYELOMELACIA That is a scary disorder Basically a death sentence   Hm hadn t heard of that It sounds like it can be caused by multiple traumatic injuries contusions of the spinal cord It may not be a death sentence but the severe cases will put the patient on a ventilator for good in addition to near complete paralysis Sounds nasty      My balance is getting worse and worse  which is common in cases of cord compression  and so I fall more often now    Spinal cord damage or irritation should not affect the sense of balance itself but motor function impairment and proprioceptive sense impairment can lead to falls      My fingers went blue every so often but running hot water over it turned it back to flesh color   Sounds like vasospasm  uncontrolled spasm like constriction of the blood vessels  Lyme s disease can cause this but it can also be caused by lots of other things and even occur by itself without a discernible cause    https   en wikipedia org wiki Raynaud_syndrome u drbigfooter  Yes I have very good insurance It s Florida Blue  BCBS   BlueOptions PPO    but it allows me to use it out of state as long as you accept BCBS I can only imagine it was the acute trauma of all the car crashes I ve been in that s compressing my cord I also have neurological lyme disease which is causing system wide inflammation possibly compressing the cord even further    At T5 6 there is a focal 4 mm central disc protrusion which compresses the ventral spinal cord and is unchanged There is an unchanged area of increased T2 signal in the cord which may represent myelomalacia  image 18 series 14        At T7 8 there is a 2 mm right paracentral disc protrusion which abuts the ventral spinal cord and is unchanged  image 22 series 14        At T9 10 there is a 4 mm right paracentral disc protrusion which abuts the ventral spinal cord and has increased in size from the prior study  image 29 series 14        At T10 11 there is a broad based 1 mm left paracentral disc protrusion with an annular fissure which effaces the ventral thecal sac and is unchanged  image 32 series 14    Why just T5 T6 Don t these other ones state that they compress the cord as well  T7 T8   T9 T10 use the terminology  abuts  and T10 T11 says  effaces  so I m not sure  Also why would a thoracic compression be causing these neurological symptoms all over my body Literally head to toe My Dr told me that thoracic compression can cause system wide neurological issues but the people on this thread are making me doubt it a bit Anyways if my Neurosurgeon that I m seeing this week decides not to perform surgery I d like to maybe come and see you I don t even have an external cd drive I ll burn it at Kinkos and mail it What is your real name I would like to know about a doctor if I am considering surgery with him  I ll tell you this though   I m declining I just quit shaving after 1 minute because I couldn t stand Trying to find a table that goes across a

severed allowing some but not all nerve activity  See ASIA B description   https   en wikipedia org wiki American_Spinal_Injury_Association    I can feel a catheter being inserted It also causes a tingling at the bottom of my left foot once it s fully inserted for some reason I can t move a muscle in my legs  besides involuntary spasms  but I can enjoy a massage and feel pain    I was wondering if I can get some backup on this   Presence or absence of sensory information could be shown by doing a sensory evoked potentials test Roughly speaking this involves periodically stimulating some part of the body with small electric shocks and measuring an EEG at the same time If any sensory information reaches the brain this can be seen on the EEG   Usually this test is done in order to test for demyelinating processes which will increase the time it takes for the stimulus to reach the brain but I assume the procedure would also show if the stimulus reaches the brain or not  C6 here   Don t know of the catheter part but I also could somehow  sense  the position of my feet and legs But when I asked my dad to poke my lower extremities with his finger   with a needle while eyes closed I can t feel anything So I believe it s just false sensation of phantom limb for me   Maybe you could do a test by yourself to confirm whether it s just phantom limb sensation  It seems really weird your doctors would deny that if they know you re incomplete   I m incomplete and get loads of different sensation below the level of my injury  My level is t5 incomplete as of  97 I had trouble communicating the different sensations early on due to my age and what little I managed to explain was dismissed I was basically told I could feel nothing below my chest and that was that Anything to suggest otherwise was just nerve pain apparently   Since getting older and listening to my body I have learnt that the dismissed sensations are actually perfectly valid From knowing when I need to use the toilet to having somthing digging into my leg being able to enjoy a sex life and finding shoes uncomfortable  I ve concluded that without actually experiencing life with a spinal cord injury not even the best doctor can fully understand what is going on so you don t need their acknowledgement to validate your experience just listen to your body      American Spinal Injury Association    The American Spinal Injury Association  ASIA  formed in 1978 publishes the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury  ISNCSCI  which is a neurological exam widely used to document sensory and motor impairments following spinal cord injury  SCI  The ASIA assessment is the gold standard for assessing SCI ASIA is one of the affiliated societies of the International Spinal Cord Society The exam is based on neurological responses touch and pinprick sensations tested in each dermatome and strength of the muscles that control key motions on both sides of the body  Muscle strength is scored on a scale of 0 5 according to the adjacent table and sensation is graded on a scale of 0 2  0 is no sensation 1 is altered or decreased sensation and 2 is full sensation  Each side of the body is graded independently             PM  https   www reddit com message compose to kittens_from_space       Exclude  me  https   reddit com message compose to WikiTextBot message

to a professional in this case an ergotherapist They will be able to give you an unbiased opinion   That being said about your question  there are manual wheelchair made specifically for people with hemiplegia where you will be able use your functional leg and arm to get around This would help prevent some muscle loss  compared to an electric chair  and still keep you mobile It would also be a bit cheaper and it s easier to argue its necessity with an insurer Similarly you can get manual chairs that have electric assistance if you have some arm function in your affected side It s almost always recommended to use a manual wheelchair of some kind to get around over an electric one You always have to weigh pros and cons but seeing as you re asking this question because you are concerned about your health I would definitely explore this option before going to an electric chair
