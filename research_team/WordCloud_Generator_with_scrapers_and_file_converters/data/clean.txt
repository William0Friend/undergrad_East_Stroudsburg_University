URGENT  I need someone to answer this questionHonestly smoking will shorten your life more than your spinal cord will I know people who ve had their spinal cord injuries for 40  years and one woman who has had hers for 63 years  Hey Asher it depends on the severity of your SCI There are some that say the injuries at the C vertebrae can be risky for someones life if you dont have the right treatment Im a T7 complete so it doesnt really affect my breathing muscles too much But smoking  cigarettes   will shorten your life more than any SCI Smoke weed instead    But you can message me anytime you want   Hi Asher You asked for something based on statistics Here s a study cited nearly 1000 times   https   www archives pmr org article S0003 9993 99 90252 6 pdf  All I did was Google  spinal cord injury mortality statistics  if you want more  I have a friend in his early 60s who became quadriplegic in his late teens   still living a full and productive life as CEO of a Non Government Organisation  Been married for many years  since before I met him and I have known him for nearly 30 years   Asher you should live until at least 60 unless you get an infection Eat lots of protein stay away from sugar and carbs and keep yourself active You don t just want long life but you want good quality of life  Well I m 50 and have been in a wheelchair From a car accident  c6 incomplete quad  since I was 16 and still going strong Smoking isn t the best thing for you especially with a spinal cord injury as it reduces blood flow to major organs and you want to keep your kidneys healthy Renal failure along with heart disease and Respiratory illness are our major downfalls Stay active positive and live as healthy as you can and you will live a long as most ABs do   Edit  hit me up if you have any questions Hey Asher I hope you got some helpful answers  In my experience of which I also have a type dwarfism similar to Peter Dinklage you will hear a lot of  expertise   on these things from people who read an article online from who knows what   I bring up my dwarfism because long before I had my SCI going back to grade school people told me  dwarfs  have shorter lifespans  just like I still sometimes run into Of course it s not based in any kind of reality Only someone thinking they knew something they don t   The same can be said for SCI You can see even in this small thread in a small subreddit there are multiple examples of people living perfectly average lifespans Don t let people scare you with their falsehoods I m sure they ll cite some article somewhere but I guarantee they didn t understand it or missed something whatever it may be   You have a lot of time ahead and there s so much you re going to do  I hope this helped a little     it may seem odd but that is the actual grammatically correct plural version of dwarf as opposed to  dwarves  which is what s used in fantasy novels like The Hobbit etc but in reality is not what s used   Hard to say you didn t list your level or asia score I have had a couple friends die young because of blood clots and know some that are in their 70s You will last longer than you think   Medical technology is accelerating fast   no spinal cures   but every other complication will have therapies solutions  Yeah the smoking will kill you or mess with your chances Try some breathing exercises instead of tobacco  420 is ok but try water bong or baking it Please stay away from tobacco cigarettes You should last long if you drink lots of water every day make sure you watch out for pressure sores try eating veggies I m just really anxious could I message youAnd sometimes a person wants to hear from someone in the same situation and not from what other people have wrote I tried reading that it s not working for my brainUpgrade Got a new TiLite titanium chair with ergo seating For anyone getting a new manual chair anytime soon check it out Splurged on the color package and the tattoo engraving Going from my quickie to this is literally life changing The ergo seating helps with balance in the chair so much It s literally like I went from a mini van to a sports car  With ergo seating the seat bar is bent  This is a very nice looking ride The difference a quality char makes is mind blowing  Sweet ride here s my latest set of wheels  https   imgur com gallery 1POgY I m on my 1st chair  Quickie Helium  and this looks cool as all hell Will keep TiLite in mind for the future  Man I wish I could afford some sort of chair other than what Medicade has given me that thing hurts my back and constantly is breaking because the rubber comes off of the wheel I m Jelly That looks so amazing Enjoy your new ride  That s a slick looking chair Love the blue spokes  Sweet ride Cool color combo Love my ZRA I have pretty much the same chair just without the ergo seating but the same blue and blue spokes I just got the titanium push rims best chair I ever had  I have the same Spinergy wheels  Which model did you have previously For the record I m going the opposite way round Moving to what you ve got We went with the dual tube cuz I literally snapped my quickie frame in half above the caster Has anyone else been treated by doctors like your injury is no big deal and the damage sustained while waiting for a diagnosis was just par for the course C1 C5 6 incomplete nontraumatic and for sure I think for my neuro its about not catastrophsing the injury and freaking me out I wasn t even told I was up at C1 until I  made sufficent progress towards stability  and was told  high spinal cord injury  for a long time Getting told that was kinda nuts as I d previously thought C2 from people not telling me exactly where and my own research   I m not sure how typical my experience is though as my first year being quad is also covid year so  C5 6 incomplete with a skull fracture I had similar situation to the earlier comment 16yrs old at the of injury Taken to kids hospital but too old to be treated Taken to another to have scans Taken to another to spend time on a ward before I was transported to a spinal care ward 70 miles away where I was given ALOT better treatment I can t remember which of the first 2 hospitals it was but I spent the night in agony as my feet had severe pins and needle and I just needed them rubbed so the pain went away Was ignored till my parents arrived in the morning think the nurse must ve quit after the telling off my mum gave her I wish I would have waited I had an accident in a country with mediocre health care I was operated on by  best spinal surgeon  in the country She told my family that I would have no nerve damage whatsoever On the plane back home I started losing consciousness and had to make an emergency landing The did a CT scan and there were pieces of bone in my spinal cord that were missed by the surgeon Had to stay at the hospital over the weekend because there was no weekend transport possible  Then when I got to the hospital in my home country I was rushed into surgery to remove the rest Pieces of bone stuck in my spinal cord for 5 days longer than needed  D4 D5 incomplete with a skull fracture Was taken to a hospital first then had to go to another one because the surgeon at the wasn t available for a day   At the second hospital skull fracture was immediately taken care of but my spine only got operated on after 2 days  I think  I have no memory of the accident and many days after Got all this from family members I m from India btw   How are you doing I m a similar situation as you C2 C5 6 My first year being a quad is also during covid Have you had any recovery I m not familiar with D as a vertebrae level Is that cervical neck Spinal Cord Injury  Facts And Statistics You Should KnowSounds right wish I was in the majority that only had an incomplete injury Also my first year cost after my accident was around  750k which is absolutely absurd  I was only compensated with 50k So tell me why I was denied disability twice I m getting ready for my 3rd round with them My first surgery to correct issues with arthritis left me unable to walk for about 5 months in 2013 I regained my ability to walk but I still have issues from the waist down Everything from numbness to severe pain They just went back in 3 months ago because my new doctor diagnosed me with kyphosis He cleaned out scar tissue and fixed a bulging disc where I had my first surgery and installed 2 rods to support a spinal fusion I had a CT scan today because I was still in a lot of pain and they found 2 loose screws in my L2 vertebra   I ve been saved from completely losing my ability to walk twice and I m grateful that the doctors were able to do that for me But screw the government for telling me that someone would hire me in my condition I have to much work experience which means there are a lot of jobs they seem to think I can do I ve stopped typing this out 3 times so far to adjust myself because I m in pain I can t even fall asleep without taking a bunch of pills Spinal injuries are being treated just like mental health in a lot of cases I have issues with both and neither of them get the attention they need  I didn t even have a traumatic injury and spent a total of exactly 11 days in the hospital spinal unit after surgery due to complications That number just hit me personally  These rehab numbers are hilarious compared to Europe Rehabilitation is often for over 12 months Granted this is a very slow and ineffective and honestly passive treatment compare to what I ve heard of in the US 23 hours a day in bed  one hour of physiotherapy Poor nutrition  You say  only an incomplete  yet you can have an incomplete damage by definition and be just as bad off as someone with a complete injury Just saying   Same ish here at least in the same order of magnitude Should we be speaking with personal injury attorneys You got this my friend It s only a number now A distant memory I spent 4 days in ICU after my reconstructive surgery and another 7 in step down before a month in the ward and then 5 months at in patient rehab Those first 11 days were definitely wild but looking at how far I ve come  Cant discount anything that s happened Long shot torso stability questionSounds like it could be scoliosis Sometimes a brace can help but they can also be a pain  Lumbar Decompression BeltC3 C7 Spine TumorEveryone I know who has an incomplete injury has daily pain Mind bending to be sure myself included My friends with complete injuries have spasms but don t feel it I guess what I m getting at is anyway you slice it there are a whole lot of negative issues to deal with But I try to stay positive or rather more positive by understanding that no matter how bad you got it someone has it way worse So do what you can to deal with it then put a little more mental work in and finish it through It s NOT easy but the first hurdle of being alive is behind you You ll not always be able to be out in front of the pain or your situation but like any loss in your life it ll get a little easier as you go Be safe and get better Cheers It sounds like you may have arachnoiditis  search doctor Forest Tennant on google  That word is making me think of a deformed spider THE STINGING Colostomy complications need adviceIs her colostomy productive   putting out stool  I d recommend some radiology studies to make sure she doesn t have a blockage from twisting or adhesions scar tissue Since the colostomy is temporally related to her AD I d investigate that first  Thank you She has had no output since yesterday morning She is post surgery two weeks I really appreciate your response Exercise in water It helped me when I was in hospital The resistance of the water is a good starting point As it s buoyant and if you fall you just float I saw significant gains from exercising in water  There are a wide range of activities techniques and underwater equipment that can be performed used that are super helpful  Even when I was in rehab 15 years ago we did PT in the pool  They had water dumbbells that were basically just floaty dumbbells  Even just swimming with your arms is good exercise with low impact on stuff like your rotator cuffs etc  also it was a nice change from the monotony of the rehab gym lol Okay that s good to know Thank you   That s great to know Thank you   Okay that s good to know Thank youIs stretching a non functioning limb important Absolutely I m a t5 Para and For me stretching helps both spasms and nerve pain a ton Another good way that stretches your heel cord Achilles etc is the standing frame Which is also good for circulation and clot prevention  I get on the floor and stretch every other day or so  Both butterfly stretches and my Achilles calf Careful with butterfly stretches I tire my groin once pushing to hard lol Which would be easy not having stretches them in years  Yes His OT PT should ve recommended this after the injury I d definitely recommend he see one ASAP as the years of not stretching can lead to things like clots or tendon tightness that requires surgery When I stretch my legs even though I m no longer truly paralyzed anymore they shake violently because they re so used to not being used much It s a sign that my husband and I aren t doing enough to stretch them move around  Also if you want the perspective of helping here is one Gives step by step instructions  Although I m an advocate for doing everything you can yourself   https   www sportsrec com 491527 stretching exercises for
